same materials. They are not all paint
ed alike, but even with this distinction
the architecture remains monotonous.
The unpleasant impression thus made
upon a visitor is, however, completely
effaced by the beauty and strength of
the location and environment of the
city, and when one enters a typical
Venezuelan home one forgets in an in
stant the monotony of the exterior. One
realises that it is the habit of the aver
age Carequeno to spend on interior dee
oration the money he has spared on the
exterior. In the house of a compara
tively well to do Venesuelan the finish
ings and furnishings will be found to
be as elegant and as expensive as In
the home of an American of the same
class, and the wealthy Carequeno Is
even more extravagant than the wealthy
American In the matter of Interior ap
pointments. Moreover, the houses,
though squat, are broad and long, and
the area covered by one of them would
give room enough for the erection of a
dozen houses like those that line the
streets of New York.
Caracas is also noted for its beauti
ful parks, in the principal one of which
Is located a splendid statue of the great
patriot Bolivar. Next to him the Ven
ezuelans have the greatest reverence
for George Washington, and in the see
ond principal square in Caracas have
erected in his honor a statue of almost
equal magnificence to that of Bolivar.
The pride of the city, however, is
the beautiful tomb of Bolivar. This
tomb was originally in Trinity church,
but in 1870 was changed into a nation
al pantheon. In addition to the re
mains of Bolivar the pantheon contains
those of all the presidents of the repub
lic front 1870 and a few of the leading
men.
American enterprise has made itself
felt throughout the city and is largely
responsible for the progress Caracas
has made in recent years. There are
two American telephone companies,
and an American corporation operates
the Bolivar Tramway company.
While Caracas is not the hotbed of
disease which so many Americans
popularly auppose it to be. it is far
from being a healthy city. Bad sew
erage renders it susceptible to fevers of
all sorts. Yellow fever is always spo
radic, but does not product' the panic
that it does in the United States, for
with careful nursing a Venezuelan has
a better chance of recovery than wouldi
an American stricken with typhoid
fever. Another thing that tends to
make Caracas unhealthy are the sad
dlen changes of climate, verging from
a cool, bracing atmosphere at dawn to
an extreme sultriness at noon and final
ly to a damp, clammy chill at nightfall.
such are the meteorological conditions
if Caracas for the entire year.

A TRAIL ON THUNDER MOUNTAIN.
cently that the real truth has drifted
east of the mountains. The first nota
ble fact was the sale of the Caswell
brothers' great Lind to Colonel Dewey
for the sum of $100,000 and his refusal
but a few months thereafter of $4,000,
000 for the property, the Dewey mine.
But where Is Thunder mountain? In
Idaho, 200 miles north and a trifle east
of the city of Boise. How to get there?
From Boise you take a pack train load
ed with your outfit and start on a 200
mile tramp through beautiful valleys,
up over the roughest of mountains,
down steepest declivities, over deepest
canyons and trailing by purest crystal
streams till you reach Roosevelt.
Roosevelt in July last was a city of
tents, shacks and log cabins, with not
a wagon track in sight. The streets
were alive with big, brainy and brawny
men, there to reap their fortune, what
ever it might be. There waq one lone
Texas girl, the only woman in the
camp. She, with her father, tramped
the hills day after day hunting for the.
"yellow." the succeeded. By a sale
of a fourth of her holdings to Pittsburg
people she derived a goodly fortune.
Every one but a few drones followed
the same occupation. That was all they
were there for, and in no such space ot
time were as many hills prospected as
were those in the Thunder mountain
country during July, August and Sep
tember last.
First the discoveries were made on
Trap creek, then on Smith creek, next
on Sugar creek, and only tomorrow per
haps the richer reports may come froan
other streams. The rush in the middle
of the night to locate claims was un
precedented. Occasionally some pros
pector sneaks into the assay office with
his little bag of "rock," and after the
result of the assay has been announced
he gives the tip to a few of his inti
mates. In an incredible space of time
that night the "trail" Is covered by
scores who somehow learn of the new
prospect. The efforts of 2,500 prospect
ors to cover 500 square miles produced
results.
A group of 1'ittsburgers had their
forces at work on Rainbow mountain,
Fairview hill and Lightning peak. To
the Pittsburgers' energy and persever
ance this section owes its early devel
opment and establishment as a perma
nent mining camp. They own the
Fairview, Sunnyside, Lava (reek and
Dewey group of mines, anil the sea
son's development in all those proper
ties has revealed veins or dikes of ore
running from $i to $1,200 per ton in
free gold ore.
And yet the great district has hardly
been touched. Thirty tunnels are being
run this winter, and by March or April
the strikes made will astonish the min
ing world. Nature has been lavish in
her distribution of gold on Thunder
mountain. The great dikes are 30 to
100 feet in width, and the gold is thor
oughly disseminated throughout the
vein or dike fillings. The vein fiulirg
is a porphyry rock-soft, easily worked,
yet solid enough to stand well in the
excavations. There are already eight
tunnels driven to a depth of over 200
feet, and there is enough ore in sight
to justify the erection of a reduction
plant.
The facilities for reducing the or-s
of the district and the extraction of
the values are ilninsuall gill I. Timber

right. They are now y ueasing right In
the 'IThunder mounntaini 1ounntry ever
since the famtous strikes of last July.
No tribute has to be patid to the smelter
or the railroad in Thunder mountain.
The ore is mined and reduced to bullion
on the ground and sold at the assay of
fice in Boise City.
Thunder mountain has in embryo a
dozen homestakes today. and it has
only taken a few months of prospecting
to bring about the results. In the great
rush doubtless many valuable acres
have been passed over. It all could not
even be scratched. Great strikes will
be made during the coming summer on
ground Qverlooked, for that has been
the case oftentimes in nearly every min
ing camp discovered. The rush of peo
ple to the Idaho mining country next
spring is bound to be phenomenal. All
over the west preparations are already
being made, and before springtime the
fever will be in the blood of the eastern
speculator and investor.
But a word to all. 1)o not start before
