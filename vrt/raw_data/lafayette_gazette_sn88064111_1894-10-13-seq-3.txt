Obituary.
John .T Tierney died at his home
in this town at 4:3o Tuesday morn
ing. Mr. Tierney was born in
Springhill, Ala., in the year r85x;
he came to Lafayette eight years
ago and during that time he has
been in the employ of Southern Pa
cific Company as engineer; he was
a member of that brotherhood of
brave men whose devotion to duty
has won the admiration of the world.
During a faithful service of fourteen
years, he never failed to perform
his duty, though it sometimes meant
great dangers and severe trials.
Mr. Tierney was a man of ster
ling worth and generous heart; an
examplary citizen, his death marks
the loss of a valuable member of the
co umunity. His remains were
taken to Algiers for burial.
A widow and three children are
left to mourn his death. To them
The Gazette begs to extend its
sincerest sympathy.

CARENCRO NEWS.
The Gazette Correspondent's
WVeekly Resume of Itemts of
Interest in and About
Carencro.
-The Bayou Carcncro Base
Ball club report to your correspon
dent that they were very shabbily
treated by the home team of Lafa
yette last Sunday. If the Lafayette
club realized early in the game
that they had met their match, and
saw defeat staring them in the face;
or whether they were ignorant of
the ordinary rules of the game, is
the question now being discussed
by the Carencro boys and their
friends. The Lafayette team of
fered fair inducements, and ex
tended a number of invitations to
the Carencro club to play a friendly
game of ball on their grounds. Ex
pecting at least fair treatment, such
as the Carencro team are in the
habit of giving to others, they ac
cepted the invitation last Sunday.
They went there in good faith to
pass the evening in friendly rivalhy,
and claim that they were very badly
treated for their trouble.
-At a meeting of the "building
committee" held last Sunday evening
at the residence of Rev. Father La
forest, it was decided to commence
immediately the erection of the new 1
church. The probability is, that
the contract will be awarded Mr. i
Geo. Chachere, of Ope;ousas, who
has submitted plants and specifica
tions that meet with the approval
of the committee. 'the indications
are that within the next two or
three years, the people will have
a church such as they can well be
proud of.
-Messrs. Hi. Hebert and J. D.
Breaux have built for themselves 4
and fIiends a hunters' lodge, in the
woods near Guilbeau's Springs, 1
where they can pass their leisure
ti 3 in hunting and fishing.
-Mr. Adam Sounier, one of ottr i
local amateur fishermen, landed
!656 fish during the last season.
Pl'hlis is lard to beat.
-Rev. Father Vette, of New (,t-1
,.a'n . arsivexd la:;t Monday. li I
Fwas recieved at the depot by a
number of his old time frieds.
-Mrs. E. Brown went to New
Orleans a few days since to attend
the marrige of her sister, Miss
Louise Millaudon, to Mr. E. Beau
vais, of that city.
---The Carencro Sugar Company's
plant will be ready for operation
about the 2oth of this month.
-Mr. and Mrs. Adolphe Guil
beau were in town this week.
-Mr. and Mrs. Lobdelle, of
Olivier station, were the guests of
Evangeline plantation last Friday
and Saturday.
-Messrs. Guilbeau and Stelly
were in Opelousas on Monday last.
-The movement of cotton this
year is very slow. There is no
doubt that many of our cotton
planters, will go into other cultiva
tion next year. It is simply and im
possibility for a man to raise cotton
at the present prices. As far as su
gar cane is concerned, there is no
doubt that sugar is passing through
its hardest trial this season. Pro
viding our bolting planters do not
succeed in having sugar placed on
the free list next December, the
chances are that the sugar industry
will be in a more prosperous con
dition next year. While Congress
was trying to decide how much in
jury it could do to the sugar inter
est, which consumed several months,
the "Trust" imported an immense
quantity of sugar free of duty.
This stock is still on hand, and has
a depressing effect on- the value of
the home product. When next sea
son rolls around this supply will he
exhausted, and then will be the time
that the advolorem duty will show
its actual and contemplated effect.
This year the Louisiana planters are
working on a free sugar basis;
while next year it will be different.
--Poultry raising is on the de
crease in this section, and yet there
is nothing that pays better.
-Mrs. Dugal was a visitor to
Sunset last Tuesday.
-Mr. H. E. Toll, parish super
intendent of public schools, went to
Lafa) ette last Saturday, to gladden
the hearts of the teachers, by pay
ing their salaries.
--Dr. E. Perrault is home again
after a long visit to relatives and
friends in Natchez. Mr. Perrault!
will leave in a few days for New
Orleans, where he will commence
his second session at Tulane Uni
versity, medical department.
-These chitly nights and cool
mornings, are gentle reminders that
sunnmer is slowly passing away; and
the good house-wife is paying her
compliments to cedar chests, and
bundles, and bringing forth the
overcoat, and other wraps long
since stored away between layers of
camphor, phenol and tobacco,
which combined give that peculiar
drugstore-order that persists in fol
lowing a man throughout the win
try season.
--The death of Mr. Jack Tierney,
the veteran engineer, so long in the
service of the Southern Pacific
Company, was indeed sad, and has
called forth many expressions of
sympathy for the family, by his
friends in Carencro.
-There are a large number of
small sugar mills being put up
hereabouts this year

-The resurrection of the Re
publican party in Louisiana, as
suredly presents food for deep
est reflection. It's sudden boom in
the congressional race, bears ill tid
ings for the state and local elections
of '96. The olack, ignorant vote
must not count; the negro's duty is
at his plow, and should he fail to
heed the warning of his superiors,
then, of course, he succumbs to
inevitable circumstances. Already
tha atmosphere is polluted with
miasms coming from black and tan
politicians. These infectious germs
are naturally contracted by the ig
norant black. He listens to the
stories of castles to be built; he
glories in the political privileges
promised him; he imbibes freely of
the cheap campaign whisky poured
dtown his throat, and when under
the influence of that fearful narcrtic,
he casts his vote for ."he does
na)t know whom?" Such is the
political future of l.ouisiana. Wiill
Lafayette be one of the parishes to
stand by and see her rights trampled

grace I to you, white politicians,
who would plunge our parish in

will never again enter the political
field of Lafayette parish. The fourth
ward stands solid; our voters are in

many other determined voters to
protect, at any cost, our Royville
poll from an overflow of negro votes.
