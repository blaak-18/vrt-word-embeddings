EARTHQUAKE LIKE ITALY’S
NECESSARY TO WAKEN US.
Weatherford, Texas.
Your card, informing me that my
subscription to the Jeffersonians has
expired, just received, and I enclose
herewith $2 for renewal, as per your
statement.
Allow me to say that I like your
papers better than any I am taking,
and I congratulate you on the gallant
fight you are making for pure, upright,
honest, governmental affairs; but in
m y judgment a great upheaval—like
that which occurred in Italy and Sicily
—will have to take place in order to
bring the people to their political
senses.
I don ’t see any hopes for the Popu
lists to do anything much until the
socialists kind run their race, which,
I think, will be the next general cam
paign. The largest number of our
people here have gone to the Social
ists. The next largest number to the
Republicans, and nearly all the rest
have aligned themselves with the
Democrats and are running for office
on this ticket.
All the voters, or nearly all, go into
the Democratic primaries, except the
Socialists, and just as long as this
practice is kept up so long will the
Democratic party control.
With my highest regards and well
wishes for your future success, I re
main, most truly,
W. M. Parsons.
“PLAN FOR A POPULIST PARTY
FUND.’’
Richland, Ga., Jan. 5, 1909.
Enclosed find money order for one
dollar, for which send me the two
Jeffersonians for six months. At the
close of six months will renew, for I
do not see how I can get along with"
out it.
I like the proposition that the gen
tleman made to send five cents per
month for campaign fund. I think
that every Jeffersonian could do that
much. I would be glad to know that
every Jeffersonian was sending from
five to twenty-five cents per month. I
will send ten cents this month.
Yours truly,
. W. H. Whitman.
BRYAN’S DEFEAT HAS SET PEO
PLE TO THINKING.
J. P. Major, McLean, Texas: Had
no trouble selling those Magazines.
Inclosed find $1.25. Send twenty-five
each month. It has taken the defeat
of Mr. Bryan to get the people to read.
If we had a fine talker here, we would
soon get a large following for our
cause. I think we could raise the
money to defray the expenses of a
speaker.
“THE NAME ‘POPULIST’ IS A
DRAWBACK.’’
John L. G. Woods, R. F. D. 1, Mon
ticello, Ga.: On election day a young
man told me, “I went to the polls, I
picked up your ticket, intending vot
ing for you. I saw the name ‘Popu
list’ on the ticket. I laid it down and
voted for Bryan. I could not bear the
name, ‘People’s Party.’ ” Ah, there
are numbers of people prejudiced
against the name “People’s Party,”
“Third Party,” “Populists,” “The
Pops,” etc, Some are prejudiced
against the names “Democrat,” “Re
publican,” etc. Let us change our
name to “Jeffersonians,” and call the
old parties “The Twin Hamiltoni
ans. ’ ’
I met you in Jackson and heard
your speech.' It was a grand one.
You convinced them all,'many ol tnem
Democrats. A strong Democrat from
our county said: “I’ll vote for Wat
son if I’m the only one in Georgia
to do it.” Did he do it? I think
not. It is hard for a Hamiltonian to
vote against his dear old party; he’ll
stick to it though its principles are
as corrupt as the D —l would have
them.
Yes, organize. Keep the vestal fires
burning. Agitate, educate. The
masses are with you as far as they
understand you and reform principles,
but the majority of the people are
grossly ignorant of reform principles,
and vote for Hamiltonianism, because
they don’t know any better.
We have no cause to be discour
aged, but should be encouraged. As
the people become more enlightened
as to true reform principles, they will
overthrow the tyrant of Hamiltonian
ism and flock to your standard. The
17,000 true, patriotic Georgians who
braved the weather and the plutocratic
power of corrupt Hamiltonianism and
cast their ballots for you, unfettered
as patriots and freemen, will keep the
vestal fires burning; will keep spread
ing the true doctrine as taught by Jef
ferson to the end. Thank God, I was
one of the immortal 17,000. Shell the
woods, Mr. Watson, against the Cath
olic Hierarchy, against Hamiltonian
ism, against Imperialism, and against
any and every thing that ends to cor
rupt our government and the people,
and God and the people will be with
you to the end. I fought as a Confed
erate three and a half years for prin
ciple. 1 vote for principle and not
for a party, or a name.
WANTS A NEW NAME FOR
PARTY.
J. S. Cantrell, Northview, Mo.: You
will please find enclosed one dollar for
which send me Watson’s Jeffersonian
Magazine for one year, as per your
advertisement.
Now, Mr. Watson, my faith in you
grows as I grow older, and if I was
out of debt 1 would buy some of your
bonds and have your Magazine sent
to a number of my friends.
Please don’t try to perpetuate the
name of Populist, for the name is
dead and can’t be resurrected. Unite
us in a new party under a new name
with the same grand principles.
WHY DO PEOPLE PAY TAXES?
Albia, lowa, Feb. 1, 1909.
Dear Bro. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
I am preparing to publish a book,
the title of which will be, “Why Do
People Pay Taxes? What Benefit Do
They Receive? The Downfall of
American Government. ’ ’
Then I will try to show that the
trusts and combinations of capital fur
nish the candidates for both of the
so-called old political parties for all
of the important offices, ami furnish
them with campaign funds, while the
fool voters furnish the votes to elect
these tools of the trusts to oflice, —-
“The Second Downfall of Rome.”
Notwithstanding I still own the
Southern lowa Educator newspaper
Otye
plant, which is lying idle here, I will
give $1 to each publisher of a People’s
Party or a reform publication that
advocates Populist principles until
100 such publications arc started all
over the United States.
Every Populist and reformer could
and should do this much to'help pro
tect himself and family, if he wants
a change from the present system of
the trusts and combinations of capital.
Respectfully, ,
J. R. Norman.
BRYAN COULD NOT BE A
BAPTIST.
Wm. A. Ellington, Oxford, Ga.: Col
orado seems to be under the impres
sion that Bryan represents Jefferso
nian Democracy, when in fact he does
anything else, though we can not al
ways sometimes tell. He has been for
and against almost everything that
bobbed up in the political world with
in the last twelve years. I heard a
friend say that Bryan was a Baptist,
another friend said, “No, no! That
can not be, and I will tell you why:
Bryan can not get out of sight long
enough to be BAPTIZED.” That is
about right. Bryan is in politics for
the money: “a reformer for revenue
only. ’ ’
I am going to do all I can for your
paper: I have been with you at all
times, am now’, and until you change.
I always will be with you. I was
there during the dark days and you
did not desert us, and I know you nev
er will. When we went down you
went with us-; our defeats were your
defeats; our victories were not al
ways your victories. I thank God for
you. My only fear is that you will
shorten your days by hard work and
I can not bear the thought of losing
our only leader.
Well; you are a very busy man and
may not read this letter, anyway I’ve
let out what was in me, as we sons of
the soil are wont to do; and feel bet
ter. If it goes to the waste basket,
“let her go.”
A NOBLEMAN.
A Nobleman who is dead,
May his name be praised,
Who for our country fought,
And liberty he raised.
Washington is his name,
Forever may it reign
O’er this wide, wide continent
O’er mountain, sea and plain.
To victory, to victory, is the cry,
He feared no gun, no man,
But straightway thru the conflict
He was ready to lend a hand.
And therefore, thru all battles
He faced that onward cry,
“For Victory” was his motto,
As he ne’er let his courage die.

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. It has every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
