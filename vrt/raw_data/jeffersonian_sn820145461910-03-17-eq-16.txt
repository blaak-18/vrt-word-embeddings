T. H. WHEAT.
LOOKING FOR OLD COMRADES.
Mr. T. H. Wheat, Confederate Vete
ran, Here for the First Time in
Forty Years.
Yesterday the stirring times of
forty years ago were vividly brought
to mind by the visit to The News and
Courier of an old soldier who was
present at the first bombardment of
Fort Sumter and its evacution by
Major Anderson.
A tall, straight, dignified and gray
bearded man came to this office and
introduced himself as T. H. Wheat,
and announced that he had not been
in Charleston since the war, but was
during that time of struggle and he
roism one of the garrison of Fort
Sumter and had been orderly ser
geant of Company B, Ist artillery,
and felt rather strange in Charleston
as it now appeared after forty years
of peace and progress. He had, how
ever, found Mr. John Harleston, who
was a lieutenant in Company B dur
ing the war, and hoped to find other
comrades still living here.
Mr. Wheat, who now lives in
Hawkinsville, Ga., was at the begin
ning of the war in one of the batteries
on Sullivan’s Island, and claims to
have fired the first shotted gun at
Sumter when Anderson held it, and
to have been one of the garrison of
the fort during the ensuing years of
bombardment, varied now and then
by an attack in small boats. Mr.
Wheat had charge of one of the rifled
guns taken from the sunken ironclad,
Keokuk, and mounted in Sumter. He
can not tell, however, whether the
one on the Battery is his old comrade
or its mate, which he believes was
during the war mounted in Battery
Bee, on Sullivan’s Island. These two
cannon, the most powerful of their
day, were known as Betsy and Black
Maria, the first named being the one
mounted in Fort Sumter.
When Sherman threatened Charles
ton in the rear at the end of the war
the city and its defending forts were
evacuated, and the garrison, among
whom was Mr. Wheat and his com
pany, marched to North Carolina and

took part in the fight at Averysboro
and other places. Mr. Wheat became
sick and was sent to the hospital, and
while there he was one of 13 5 volun
teers, who though wounded and sick,
manned a battery and made their
last fight. They surrendered
to Major Wagener, of the 15th
Pennsylvania cavalry, of Sheri
dan’s corps.
Besides looking to see if his
old friend Betsy was the gun
now mounted on the Battery,
the Veteran was anxious to lo
cate a shell which, while the
company were camped on the
Battery to allow them to re
cuperate after the strain of the
greatest of the naval attacks on
Sumter, which lasted sixty-five
days, came sailing across the
harbor from the Swamp Angel
in the marshes of Morris Is
land, and buried itself in the
earth within a few feet of
where a group of soldiers were
sitting. At the time they were able
to feel where it was with a stick, but
very naturally Mr. Wheat was un
able yesterday to find its grave, as
the earth had long since settled
over it.
He also described seeing the burial
of one of Major Anderson’s men, who
was accidentally killed while saluting
the flag at the moment of surrender,
and about two years afterward seeing
the grave torn open and the bones
rudely scattered by a 300-ponud shell
from a Parrott rifle, when the fleet
was bombarding the fort.
A list of the commanders of Com
pany B, as remembered by Mr. Wheat
is interesting as showing the fre
quent changes caused by death and
promotion. At the beginning of the
struggle Captain Halenquist com
manded. then Alfred Rhett, promoted
to major, was succeeded by D. G.
Fleming, promoted to colonel and
killed in the Crater at Petersburg,
Va., and last came Julius Rhett,
wounded at Averysboro. Mr. Wheat
does not know what became of the
company after that, as he went to the
hospital and only emerged, still sick,
to fight one more battle after the sur
render of General Lee, and then him
self he surrendered and parolled.—

WHAT ABOUT THE FORT PILLOW
“MASSACRE”?
Dear Sir: —Some of our school his
tories refer to the battle of Fort Pil
low, during the Civil War, as an in
discriminate massacre. For the truth
of history I wish to correspond with
as many of the participants in that
battle as possible. I want the truth
for the truth’s sake. Those who were
there will do me at favor by writing
to me fully, and help to straighten
out a much mooted question.
Yours for truth,
J. F. PARKER.
Elgin, Texas.
DEATH OF HENRY D. FLOYD.
Dear Editor: —On March the sec
ond Mr. Henry D. Floyd, of this
county, died. Mr. Floyd was in his
77th year, was born on September
17, 1833.
Our friend was a true man, and
was not afraid to stand by his con
victions. He served through the war
between the States, and took up the
business of farming after the war,
was successful as a farmer, and lived
an independent life. During a long
period of his life he was a member
of the Primitive Baptist church, and
was a consistent member of this
church at the time of his death.
He was one of the many immov
able friends of Thomas E. Watson.
Never wavered from his support in
times that tried men, and rejoiced
in his successful efforts. He was a
strong believer in pure Jeffersonian
Democracy.
He had a great many friends, who
will miss him from the walks of life.
Farewell, old soldier, you lived to a
good purpose.
Yours very truly,
A FRIEND.

12-Year-Old Boy Learns
Shorthand in 36 Days
At BAGWELL Business College
CHARLES HATHAWAY, twelve
year-old son of C. W. Hathaway, At
lanta, Ga., learned the famous Char
tier Shorthand in 36 days at Bagwell
Business College, and he now holds
a good position. He is a sixth grade
pupil from the public schools.
The following is a letter from his
employer:
Atlanta, Ga., Feb. 5, 1910.
J. O. Bagwell, President,
Bagwell Business College,
Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: —In answer to your in
quiry in regard to Master Charley
Hathaway, will say that I consider
his work remarkable for a boy of
his age and time spent in business
college. Judging from his speed in
writing and the ease and accuracy
by which he reads his notes, the
system of shorthand he writes must
be very easy to learn for one so
young to have accomplished as
much in so short a time.
Very truly yours,
