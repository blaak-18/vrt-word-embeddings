STARTLING FIGURES.
THE GROWTH OF LANDLORDISM
ILLUSTRATED.
Out of 12,890,156 Families Is the Uniteo
States 2,250,00 of Them Occupy Mort
gaged Homes. 8.250,000 are Tenants,
Leaving 2,190.152 Home Owners,.
Final and complete statistics of
farms, homes anti mortgages has
been issued from the census office and
the figures offer an invitipg field for
study.
The report contains many striking
illustrations and the growth of land
lordism is one of the most vividly
evident facts brought out.
it is not in one portion of the coun
try only, but east and west, north and
south alike bear the same testimony,
of a tendency toward European con
ditions.
A few tigures taken at random illus
trate the situation:
In Rhode Island not quite 20 per
cent of the farms were occupied by
tenants in 1880, while in 1890 over
25 per cent were so occupied.
In Vermont during the same period
the increase is from 13 per cent to 17
per cent, while in Massachusetts in
1889 8.18 per cent of farms were oc
cupied by tenants, in 1890 over 15
per cent.
In the south, land mortgages are
not so common as in the west.and the
bulk of debt is represented by crop
liens, as cotton is more rapidly turned
into money. The per cent of tenant
farmers in Georgia increased from
1880 to 1890 from 44 per cent to 58
per cent.
In Tennessee during the same
period the increase is from 34 per
cent to 41 per cent.
As a fair index of the west: In
Minnesota in 1880(, 9 per cent of the
farms were hired and in 1890, 15 per
cent, while over 39 per cent of the
farms are mortgaged, making 54 per
cent that are virtually tenants, as the
occupant of a mortgaged home pays
interest to the mortgagee amounting.
to a rent, not unfrequently greater 1
than the tenant neighbor who makes
no pretense of ownership.
The mortgage statistics present a
situation that cannot t be XAg
with alarnLt
In the state of Kansas of the num
bes of mortgages in force in 1890 was
2i4.880 aggregating the amount of
$243,000),000, and proving a per cap
ita debt of-$170 or an average of $850
for each family. We have reason to
believe that conditions since 1880
have improved in Kansas while be
coming worse in other localities.
In Iowa the mortgage indebtedness
amounted to $199,774,171, being a
per capita debt of $104.
In Illinois the per capita mortgage
debt is $100 or *500 for each family.
These figures illustrate the situa
tion in the center of the great agri
cultural regions of the west.
The aggreate for the United States,
June 1, 1890, shows that there were
12.690,152 families; of these 2,250,000 1
occupied mortgaged homes and farms,
while 8,250,000 were tenants occupy
ing hired homes, leaving the number +
of 2,190,152 occupying their own
homes free from encumbrance.
The average amount of indebted- i
ness on each mortgage is $1257 and
the average interest on each one is
$7p)0 annually.
Figuring together those who are in
mortgaged homes paying interest, and
tenants paying rent, we have a total
of 84 per cent of the families who are
virtually tenants. while only 16 per
cent of our people are free home own
ers.

STARTLING FACTS.
RANDOM FIGURES ILLUSTRATE
THE PRESENT SITUATION.
The Increase or Landlordisam resents a
Dark Future for This Conntry That
Has for a Century Boasted Its Liberty
and Free Homes.
Final and complete statistics of
farms, homes and mortgages have been
issued from the census office and the
figures offer an inviting field for study.
The report contains many striking il
lustrations and the growth of landlord
ism is one of the most vividly evident
facts brought out. It is not in one por
tion of the country only, but east and
west, north and south alike bear the
same testimony, of a tendency toward
European conditions. A few figures
taken at random illustrate the situa
tion:
In Rhode Island not quite 20 per cent
of the farms were occupied by tenants
in 1880, while in 1890 over 25 per cent
were so occupied. In Vermont during
Sthe same period the increase is from 13
per cent to 17 per cent, while in Massa
chusetts in 1880 5.18 per cent of farms
were occupied bi tenants; in 1890 over
15 per cent. In the south, land mort
gages are not so common as in the
west and the bulk of debt is represented
turned into money. The per cent n
ant farmers in Georgia increased from
1880 to 1890 from 44 per cent to 58 per
cent. In Tennessee during the same
period the increase is from 34 per cent
to 41 per cent. As a fair index of the
west: In Minnesota in 1880, 9 per cent
of the farms were hired and in 1890, 15
per cent, while over 39 per cent of the
farms are mortgaged, making 54 per
cent that are virtually tenants, as the
occupant of a mortgaged home pays
interest to the mortgagee amounting to
a rent, not unfrequently greater than
the tenant neighbor who makes no
pretense of ownership.
The mortgage statistics present a sit
uation that cannot but be viewed with
alarm. In the state of Kansas the
number of mortgages in force in 1890
was 298,880 aggregating the amount of
$243,000,000, and proving a per capita
debt of $170 or an average of $850 for
each family. We have reason to believe
that conditions since 1880 have im
proved in Kansas while becoming worse
in other localities. In Iowa the mort
gage indebtedness amounted to $199,
774,171, being a per capita debt of $104.
In Illinois the per capita mortgage debt
is $100 or $600 for each family. These
figures illustrate the situation in the
center of the great agricultural regions
of the west.
The aggregate for the United States
June 1, 1890, shows that there were 12,
'690,552 families; of these 2,250,000 occu
pied mortgaged homes and farms,while
8,250,000 were tenants occupying hired
homes, leaving the number of 2,190,152
occupying their own homes free from
encumbrance. The average amount of
indebtedness on each motgage is $1,
257 and the average interest on each
one is $73.50 annually. Figuring to
gether those who are in mortgaged
homes paying interest, and tenants pay
ing rent, we have a total of 84 per ce,4
of the families who are virtually ten
an:s, while only 16 per cent of our peo
ple are free home owners. The mort
gaged indebtedness amounted in the
aggregate to almost three billion of
Zlollars, or a little over $44.00 each for
every man, woman and child in tLe
United States. It is useless to go far
ther witn the figures, what we have
given is a fair illustration of the whole
report.
Is it not humiliating that such con
ditlons exist? A mortgaged indebted
ness of double the actual amount of
money in the country, even though we
accept as true the trasury report of
eiroulation which make no allowance
,r losses or any other easume by whieh
the amounat in actual circuiatien talls
far below the reports. The Increase in
andiordiLsm presents a dark futture for
a country that for a century has boeasted
its liberty, its tree homes and free In
stitutionls. It portrays plainly the trend
of events which will resulmit in a land of
slaves, the most pitiable the world has

NEW YORK AGITATED.
Department Store Aggreasione Alarming
the General Trade Aqsociations.
New York paper: The Retail Butch
ers' association is the first to take de
clsive action against the.encroachments
on general trade of the department
stores. The association has ordered a
general boycott on the big dry goods
stores by families of the members of
the association. Wives and daughters
have been told to purchase nothing
from these stores, no matter what bar
gains are offered. The wholesale deal
ers in meat have also been notified
that if they continue to furnish sup
plies to these dry goods establish
ments the trade of the members of
the Butchers' association will be dis
continued. A member of the associa
tion said to-night nearly all of the
wholesale dealers have granted the
butchers' demand, and that some of
the dry goods dealers are now com
pelled to get their meat supply from out
of the city. A wholesale dealer in a
certain brand of hams, he said, had
been detected furnishing one of the
"pirate" dry goods houses and that a
boycott of that brand was ordered.
The ham has had a sale in nearly every
to in the Union, but when the dealer
ntimated that he could live without
the trade of the New York butchers,
the butchers' associations in other cities
were notified. The result, he says, is
a boycott of that particular brand
wherever it has heretofore been sold.
The grocers last week followed the ex
ample of the butchers. The Retail
Grocers' union Is one of the strongest
trade organizations in the city, having
an active membership of over 1,200.
There are as many more retail dealers
in the city who do not belong to the
union, but they are almost as a unit in
favor of the action taken. The grocers
have notified members of their families
to boycott all dry goods stores which
sell groceries and have also expressed
a desire to the wholesale grocers that
they refuse to furnish dry goods houses
with supplies. Wholesale dealers in
canned goods have been notified that
if they wish to retain the trade of the
members of the union they will signify
it by discontinuing their relations with
the dry goods firms. The butchers
and grocers confidently expect the aid
of the liquor dealers of the city in the
boycott they have started. They con
tend that the dry goods houses are sell
ing liquors the same as groceries and
meats.-The Age, Chicago.

INCOMES FROM THE SLUML
Where some of the Charitable Get the
Wealth They Give.
The ~Inconsistencies of the Rich"
would make an interesting chapter
were it not for tno fact that in all
justice it should be followed by one on
the ,,Inconsistencies of the Poor," and
then a wider judgment would end by
classing them under the --Inconsisten
cies ot Human Nature." There is,
however, a certain type of charitably
disposed rich women that have this
trait so largely in one respect that it
invites attention. A woman of this
class is taught from childhood the
duty of giving a tithe to the poor.
She is good and takes pleasure in the
duty. Religiously she apportions each
year sums of money to help the needy
and improve the vicious. She is very
devout; attends faithfully to every
church duty: sits Sunday in her lux
urious pew, and is moved to deepest
sympathy by appeals on behalf of suf
fering humanity, and gives freely
when the time comes.
If such a woman were told that she
is in a measure the cause of much
that site endeavors to alleviate by
money she would not understand.
Yet she is, and if some day she would
visit personally some of the real estate
from which is derived the income
which keeps her in ease her eyes
would open to many things. It is a
notorious fact that many of the
wealthy class are totally unacquainted
with their possessions,* which they
leave entirely in the hands of agents
whose business it is to make the most
money possible out of them. Most of
the houses in certain neighborhoods
pass through many hands until by a
series of subletting they reach the
miserable creatures who pay for a
small space within. So one of the
potent factors in -"slum" making
waxes and grows strong.
Some time ago one who had gone
down to live among the poor end
miserable, hoping by personal contact
to better their condition, found naar
the tiny house which he had taken a
most deplorable state of affairs, says
the Chicago Times. A narrow alley
way contained five small houses of
three rooms each, each room being'
occupied by one family. Fifteen fam
ilies were thus crowded into this nar
row space. One hydrant did duty for

old, male an emale, perormed w
ablutions they felt moved to indulge
in. The one outhouse was in such a
terrible condition that the stranger
feared disaster when the warm weath
er should come. He found out that
the property was owned by a woman
of wealth, and paid her a personal
visit. He described to her the terrible
conditions,of which she knew nothing,
as she never interfered with such
business, she said.
She was pursuaded, however, to
visit the place and was shocked into'
bel for two days by what she saw
there. Workmen were speedily sent
and the condition of one little slum
was materially bettered. If some
more of this personal inspection could
be brought about many more dark
spots would be brightened.
Treasare Trove In oa Altic.

Meiford, while rummaging in her

old stamps. The reticule had been

the stamps might b- valuable from
their age, she took them to her father
and asked him to inquire into their
value. Last week, to her surprise,
her fat'ser told her that for her in
terest in the stamps he would pay her
fare to Washington and back. and
her expenses for a two weeks' visit
there. This sounds like a very liberal
offer, but it is probably not so much
so as it seems. The expenses of such
a trip might be about $50. while the
stamps are worth about $90. They
are the 3-cent pink, of the issue of
1861, and are valued in the new cata
logue. which is just coming out, at
$15 each. In the old catalogue they
were offered at $5, but they have be

price, they are sufficiently valuable to
make it a lucky find.--Boston Tran

ACUTE DYSPEPSIA.
SYMPATHETIC HEART DISEASE
OFTEN ATTENDS IT.
The M(odern Treatment Consists in Re
moving .he Cause.
From Cel.ar Rapids, Iowa. Republican.
Mrs. V. ('urley who has reslded In
Clarence. Iowa, for the past twenty
two years, tells an interesting story of
what she corsiders rescue from prema
ture death. Her narrative follows:
"For ten years prior to 1994. I was
a constant sifferer from acute stomach
trouble. I hgd all the manifold symp
toms of acute dyspepsla, and at times
other trouble were present in com.pli
cation-I did. not know what it was to
enjoy a men~ No matter how careful
I might be Ri to the qualiy. quantity
and prepara don of my food, distress
always followed eating. I was des.pon
dent and blue. Almost to the point of
Insanity at times, and would have
been glad to die. Often and often I
could not sleep. Sympathetic heart
trouble set in and time and again I
was obliged to call a doctor in the night
to relieve sudden attacks of suffoca
tion which would come on without a
moment's warning.
My troubles increased as time wore
on and I spent large sums in doctor
bills, being compelled to have medical
attendants almost constantly. During
1892 and 1893, it was Impossible for me
to retain food, and water brashes
plagued me. I was reduced to a skele
ton. A consultation of physicians was
unable to determine just what did all
me. The doctors gave us as their opin
ion that the probable trouble was ul
ceration of the coats of the stomach
and held out no hope of recovery. One
doctor said, "All 1 can do to relieve
your suffering Is by the use of opium.
About this time a friend of mine,
Mrs. Symantha Smith of Glidden.
Iowa, told me about the case of Mrs.
Thurston of Oxford Junction, Iowa.
This lady said she had been afflicted
much the same as I had. She had con
sulted local physicians without relief,
and had gone to Davenport for treat
ment. Giving up all hope of recovery,
she was persuaded by a friend to take
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. The result
was almost magical.
I was led to try them from her ex
perience, and before many months I
felt better than I had for a dozen
years. I am now almost free from
trouble, and if through some error of
diet I feel badly, this splendid remedy
sets me right again. I have regained
my utrength and am once more in my
usual flesh. I sleep well and can eat
without distress. I have no doubt that
I owe my recovery to Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain all
the elements necessary to give new life
and richness to the blood and restore
shattered nerves. They are for sale by
all druggists, or may be had by mail
from Dr.- Williams' Medicine Company,

The Orange Goat.
Paddy Walsh owned an intelligent
goat. Paddy Walsh lived in Brooklyn.
One James Mullins was arrested for
stealing the goat, and the man and
goat appeared in court one morning
recently. As a compliment to St.
Patrick's day, the whiskers of the
goat were painted a brilliant green,
and, as a striking contrast, his stubby
tail was streaked with the hated
orange color. The prisoner explained
to the satisfaction of the judge that
he did not steal the goat, and he was
released. Paddy Walsh escorted the
goat from the courtroom in triumph,
and, after removing the obnoxious
color from his tail and ornamenting
it with green ribbons, sent it down
town to participate in the Hibernian
parade. "If I could ind the man,"
patriotic Paddy Walsh said, "-who
painted that goat's tail orange, I
woulk not bring him into court, but
it is likely he would need the services
at the undertaker."
It Makes a DIReremee,
A Pennsylvania judge recently sen
tenced a chicken thief to ten years in
the penitentiary for stealing $10 worth
)f chickens, and two bank men who
looted a bank out of $112,000 to one
Fear. When the chicken thief saw
that, he wept because he had not
robbed a bank. It would not have
helped him. Bank robbing is gen
-rally forgiven if the bank robber
stads well in the community, has
acommodated directors. and does his
robbing in a gentlemanly manner.
To rob a hen roost is a fowl proceed
