COCA COLA A CURSE.
Dear Sir: —I have been reading,
with much interest, your articles,
from time to time, regarding coca
cola, I verily believe it is the great
est curse on the earth today. I be
lieve that quite a lot of crimes are
directly attributable to the influence
thisj drink has upon the brain.
It is doing more to wreck our
young men and women than any one
thing you can mention. Our prohi
bition laws should be so amended as
to include cbca cola in the list of
prohibitions. I hear people say
there is no habit to coca cola. They
lie, and they know it. I know there
is a habit to it, and it is an exceed
ingly hard one to throw off.
There are three things 1 am very
much afraid of —coca cola, lightning
and pneumonia.
Yours, etc.,

A CONVERT.
Dear Sir: —Before I began reading
your weekly Jeffersonian I had only
heard of you and disliked you very
much, but after reading it two
months I can truthfully say I like
you. x

FROM ONE OF THE MOST FAITH
FUL OF THE OLD GUARD.
Well, Tom, can say to Attorney
Arnold, of Arkansas, I was on the
firing lines in Virginia from 1861 to
1865, and followed General Lee from
Seven Pines to Hatcher’s Run, Vir
ginia, south of Petersburg, where I
was wounded on the 6th February,
186 5. Was also on the firing lines in
the nineties in the thickest of the
battle, and am still pegging away
every chance I get to do something
for the Jeffs, and speak a good word
for them and vote for T. E. Watson.
If such a record will entitle me to
answer to the roll-call of the Old
Guard, I will be there till I cross over
the river and rest in the shade.
Your true friend,
J. A. MASON.
“TAINT” SO.
Dear Sir: —On Sunday, Febru
ary 6th, a preacher, Rev. J. D. Poin
dexter, said in the pulpit that it cost
eight per cent, to carry money to for
eign fields; that you had said it cost
58 cents on the dollar to get it to the
foreign fields. He said Mr. Vaughn
had butted you off the bridge, and
Len Broughton had made you put.
your tail on your back and go down
the road. I was told by a special
friend that Rev. Poindexter said,
after you made a speech in the 10th
district and were getting on the train
to leave, a lot of negro women gath
ered about the train, and you took
their babies and played -with them.
Now, Mr. Watson, this statement
can be proved if it is needed to be
done.
Your friend and supporter,
J. L. OVERSTREET.

Answer.
(1) Have never made any state
ment concerning cost of getting
money to the heathen, and have had
no controversy with Mr. Vaughn.
Did quote what the New York World
had said about how much the mis
sionaries absorbed; but stated my
lack of belief in the World’s charges.
(2) Well, if Brother Lengee
Broughton did back me out, Rev. J.
A. Scarboro, and several others, back
ed Idin out, and honors are easy. The
very idea of debating anything with
Brother Lengee, makes me laugh.
Just can’t help it.
(3) Nobody ever saw me playing
with negro children, since slavery
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
days when white and black children
romped together on the old planta
tion. Never had a negro child on my
lap, or in my arms, at any time
whatsoever, and never “played” with
one, anywhere.
It seems that this missionary busi
ness is going to resurrect a cemetery
ful of campaign lies.
Suppose I had fondled every negro
baby in Georgia, what would that
have to do with Foreign Missions?
They are “shore” hard up for ar
guments.
EVERY SHERIFF SHOULD KEEP
BOOKS AS REQUIRED
BY LAW.
Dear Sir: —I am a Newton county
man, have only been in this (Tel
fair) county one year. I suppose I
am just about to say something that
I ought not to, for some of the Court
House Ring will say that I am about
to raise a fuss. That’s just what I
want to do, —yes-sirree-bob, and I
want you to help me create the fuss.
Mr. Watson, did you know that we
had, in the fair State of Georgia, a
county with a sheriff under bond for
the discharge of his duties, who
doesn’t keep a set of books, or a
record of some kind? Old Telfair
county is the county, and the only
county I ever knew of that did not
require their sheriff to keep a set of
books of some kind.
Please tell us something about it in
The Jeffersonian.
Very respectfully,
THEO. E. SMITH.

Comment.
You might go before the next
Grand Jury, and make things inter
esting for that negligent Sheriff.

GORDON LEE WAS ONE OF THE
DESERTERS TO THE RE
PUBLICANS.
Dear Sir: —Enclosed you will find
pay for Jeffersonian for one year.
The farmers of the seventh district
are not knowing what to do about
voting for Gordon Lee, and will ap
preciate very much any advice you
may give us on the subject.
I have always voted for him, but
hear it said often that he has done
us no good at all. The only help
we’ve got has been through the in
fluence of the Hon. Mr. Moon, of
Chattanooga. We do know one
thing, that one of the best rural
routes from here was discontinued,
and we feel that he had it done, or
did not try to prevent it. Can we
afford to vote for him?
Yours for truth and information,
S. J. ENTREKIN.

Answer.
At the extra session, last year, the
Republican machine was about to
fall to pieces. Some of the Western
Congressmen rebelled against the
tyranny and corruption of Joe Can
non. They were tired of having the
West ruled and robbed by New Eng
land. They broke away from Can
non and acted with the Democrats.
Had the Democrats stood firm, in un
broken ranks, they could have ruled
Congress.
CANNON HIMSELF SAID SO, IN
HIS KANSAS CITY SPEECH.
But the Republicans managed to
prevail on enough Democrats to come
over to them to make good the de
fection of the Republicans who had
bolted.
The Democrats who deserted to
the Republicans made up for the loss
Jeffersonian
of the rebellious Westerners. These
deserters saved the day for Cannon
and the Republican machine.
What harm did that do the peo
ple?
It enabled the Republicans to re
place a bad tariff law by another very
much worse.
Under the new law, every citizen
of the country must pay more to live.
Os course, that hurts the poor more
than it does the rich. And the poor
er a man is, the worse it hurts him.
Had the Democrats remained
solid, they could at least have pre
vented the Republicans from mak
ing the tariff burden any heavier
than it was. God knows, it was al
ready a most shameful misuse of the
powers of legislation.
In the whole South, there were
only seven Democrats who deserted
to the Republicans. One of these
came from Florida.
Where did the other six hail
from?
FROM OLD GEORGIA!
Is it not a burning shame that
our State should have given the Re
publicans all but one of the South
ern traitors who went over to New
England, and helped her rob the
whole country?
Gordon Lee was one of these de
serters. Don’t encourage future
treachery by vpting for him again.
The same thing may be said of
Lon Livingston, Bill Howard,
Charles Edwards, and William G.
Brantley.
At the most critical time since the
Civil War, these Georgians (and oh,
how’ they have snorted for the dear
old Democratic party!) joined your
enemies and fastened on you one of
the most infamous laws that ever
plundered the Many to enrich the
Few!
As they joined the Republicans,
let the Republicans re-elect them.

WE NEED TO GO BACK.
Dear Sir: —I will write you a few
lines to inform you that I am an
old Texan and Confederate soldier,
and am acting as an agent for your ’
noble books and periodicals.
I must say that I love to read after
a man who is sitting on the tower of
liberty for the supremacy of the Cau
casian race, —America for Americans.
Do away with the Socialism of Be
bel, and his like; negro equality and
negro office-holders over the Cauca
sian race, whose blood was spilt at
Valley Forge and Bunker Hill. . We
need to get back to our first love, —
true Democracy, as taught by Thomas
Jefferson, Washington, Calhoun and
others. Strike out the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth amendments, and let
us return to white supremacy for the
government of this free America.
I hope you may live long to throw
on the light of truth, that the young
generation may see before it is too
late.
Your mission work has opened the
eyes of the blind lay members of the
different denominations, who have
not studied how their Foreign Mis
sion money was spent. But some say
that Watson don’t look on the good
