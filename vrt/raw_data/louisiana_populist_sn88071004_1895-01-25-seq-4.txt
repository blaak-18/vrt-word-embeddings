Peter Minuit's Mistake.
IHistory tells iiu that 214 years
ago. or in 1t,24;, Peter Minuit
bought Manhattan island from the 11
Indians and paid for it $24 in lier- p
,chandise.
It has u.uially ,een thought that
Peter toO,k advantage of the igno- 'I
rance of the untutored savage and A
mIade an excellent bargain for him- S
self.
No doubt but that P'et(r thought ti
it a good trade, particularly when
lie considered the value of lots af- p
ter the streets would be laid out.
Central park improved, Brooklyn
bridge built and the island had a ti
lxipulation of two millions; for
Peter was a shrewd real estate a
speculator and lokked a long way
ahead with a correct, prophetic
eye.
Notwithstanding all of Peter's
shrewdness and foresight he made v
the mistake of his life and lost mil- 0
lions of dollars hy his purchase. I
lie didn't stop to fgure interest.
Since 16326 the rate of interest in
this country, where money has al- n
ways been in demand, has ranged
from six per cent up to highway
robbery. It will be conservative
to say that eight per cent, is a fair
average.
Now, if Peter had loaned his $24 t
at eight per cent, compound inter- I
est, money will double once in
about nine years- Now, there has I
been twenty-nine times 9 years, and
seven years more, since Peter made
his purchase. Then, if he had 1
loaned his $24 he would have had
nearly $400,000 at the end of the t
first one hundred years, and more
than $200,000,000 at the close of 1
the second centuary, while in 1894
his principal of $24 would have
grown to hobe $2,000,000,000-the
value of Manhattan island many
times over.
So, in fact the Indians got the
best of the bargain, and no doubt
they chuckled over the situation as
they walked through Baxter
street with the $24 worth of mer- r
ciandise in their arms.--Ex.
c, The questiou then. arises if all a
the people who have ever ` lived in
e'w York city have been unable l
jihelsep 8 per cent compound inter- i'
'eat paid on $24 and they have not, C
as the above figures show most
conclusively, bow in the name of
humanity are we going to pay the t
" interest on $32,000,000,000 which a
this country now owes? And vet
Cleveland and C'arlisle go merrily r
on piiin the delt higher, and a v
dernoerttic conress looks idly on
with mnasterly indifference.
U
The Effects ofFubon. e
'the injurious effects of fusion a
and the beneficial effects of the
straight middle-of-the-road policy u
is well illustrated in Iowa. In 1892 b
weepolled in the state 20,595. In t
1894 we polled 34,968, a gain oft
14,373 .
In tue five congressiolnal dis-a
t.ricts where there was no fusion 1
either in 189s or '94 we made a
* .gain of 12,268. In the other eiz
drsetricts only 2,104. Fusion evi. a
deatly begets a apirit of policy and
hanbdicna public speakers for fear ti
df eMding the old lparty with
whm fbto has been attempted.
