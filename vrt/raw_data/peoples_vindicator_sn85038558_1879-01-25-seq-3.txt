quested to meet at the residence of

the usual boor.
A full attendance is requested, as
Sbudness of importane is to be trans

6 By order of the PnRastra'T.
A serenading banJ lisa been regu
larly organized here and propose to
make their organisation a permanent
d one, both for their own amousement as
well as that of the public.
SYe loeal saw a workman perched on
° the apes-of the frame of the Method
ist church, now being construeted
here, and working away connecting
e the frame work. Ugh ! it made one
dizzsy to look at him.
The mud is so sticky and tenaeious
r that we have actually seen a stouot
team bog in the middle of the street,
and refuse to pull an empty wagon,
and a horse fall to carry his rider. Oh I
the mad, the miserable mud !
Thanks to the State Superintendent
of Public Education, Boo. Robert M.
Luesher, for a copy of his annual re
port to the General Assembly of Lou
isiana.

The river at this ponlat is rising slow.
ly, just enough water to remind us
that we have a river. From news
above we see that it is rising at all
points, and ern therefore reasonably
hope we will have water enough in a
few weeks for our favorite packet,
the New Bart Able, to pay us a visit.
The weather at this writing is warm,
cloudy and indicative of rain, which
will increase the rise and hasten the
coming of the boat to the landing.
A little male came down St. Deals
street, with a double sett of harnes
on, and just before reaching Second
street, while in a fearful mad hole,
that moule concluded to "shoek' his
gear. He reared up before, kicked
up behind, jumped, cavorted and
snorted, made the the md fly through
the air, until it resembled a dock of
blackbirds, and-be subeided and
trotted quietly along. Commend us
to a mule for pare devilment.
The cranks of the jstiee machine
has been turning rather lively during
the week, and hie honor parades the
boulevards of the city with a smile

he asks the boys to take "sethi,',
but the boys bein of a tempeA
order refuse, and the aforesaid Squire
mumbles the following; "another
soul made happy."
Complaints are made loud and
deep, that during the prevalence of
so much mud, both horsemen and
teamster, drive and ride on the pave.

impassable for pedestrians. Parti
ticularly is thi the ase on Third
street. Will the City Conncil endeav

our worthy City Marshal just gobble
up some of the ofenaders t It is more
than a shame to destroy and ruin
what FEW foot paths THE CITY
CAN BOAST OF.
The vote on the Luet amendment as
eompiled by the Secretary of State
stands: For New Orleans 21,623 ;

the majority for Baton ouge would
net have been less than 90,000, The
people of the State are opposed to
New Orleans for the State scapital.

about the sudden rise sad fall of Red

the Grand Ecoriana had been taking
a three days bath, but as they have
had a thorough cleaning no more

need'at look for Cane rising before
