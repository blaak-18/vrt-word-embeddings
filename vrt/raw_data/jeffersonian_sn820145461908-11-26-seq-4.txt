SUGGESTIONS IN COTTON
BREEDING.
Every farmer in Georgia who
grows cotton wishes to make as
many pounds of lint to the acre as
his land will yield. Only a few days
ago it was our pleasure to go through
several cotton fields in South Geor
gia for the purpose of pointing out
some means of improving a standard
variety grown in that section. The
planter took us to the best cotton in
a small field and then to the poorest.
We asked the planter if it ever oc
curred to him just how many bolls to
the plant his cotton would average.
He replied that it seemed to be well
fruited. Both of us proceeded then
to count the bolls on a great many
plants. The following is what we
found on thirty plants, taking ten
in each three sections of the small
field:
Ist 10 2nd 10 3rd 10
No. No. No.
Plant Bolls Bolls Bolls
1 43 36 29
2 39 18 18
2 43 25 22
4 27 33 33
5 36 13 35
6 23 36 26
7 29 11 39
8 37 24 31
9 39 40 19
10 18 26 24
There is about as much variation
in one part of the field as another,
but we find that one part averages
higher than another. Therefore, we
would naturally go to that part to
collect seed for planting. But among
the first ten plants, as shown in col
umn one, the range is from 18 to 43
bolls. We then proceeded to figure
just what it would mean to have a
field of cotton plants all producing
43 bolls instead of 18. It was clear
ly seen that the yield would be in
creased 250 per cent and wpuld not
cost a cent more for labor or fer
tilizer. This simple illustration
proved: First, that there is a great
variation in the yield of plants in any
field of cotton; second, that if interest
is shown in the yield of individual
plants, the average farmer can dou
ble his yield by getting his cotton
crop to the standard of his best
plants. No field of cotton is alto
gether free from good plants. In
fact, the best plant in a sorry field
of cotton is better than the average
plant in a good field. The fault lies
in the lack of interest shown by the
grower. He should know’ the aver
age yield of his plants and gradually
eradicate the poor fruiting plants
that do not pay for the fertilizer it
takes to grow them.
If the farmer’s have any questions
to ask in reference to these simple
suggestions, the State College of Ag
riculture will be glad to answer them.
We ask that each one who makes an
effort to improve his cotton by the
method suggested keep a record of
his efforts and see if it pays.

PLANTS SEE AND THINK.
Professor Sir George H. Darwin,
second son of Charles Darwin and
president of the Association for the
Advancement of Science, which is in
session here, asserted in his address
at the opening of the convention that
plants possess consciousness, have
memory and develop habits, says a
cable from Dublin in New York
American. Today Professor Wagner
not only supported Professor Dar
win, but proved that plants can see
as well as think.
The Professor startled the gather
ing of scientists by exhibiting pho
tographs taken through lenses formed
by the “eyes of plants.” He showed
that the outer skins of many leaves
are in fact lenses, much like the eyes
of many insects, and that they are
as capable of forming clear images
of surrounding objects. This, lie
showed, is the case with most leaves,
but especially with those of plants
that grow in the shade. These lenses
are so good and focus the light that
falls on them so carefully that pho
tographs can be taken by means of
them.
Professor Wagner has taken a
great many of these photographs of
plant eyes, and he showed some of
the more remarkable. They includ
ed the reproductions of photographs
of Professors Darwin and Huxley, in
which the features were distinct and
unmistakable, as well as direct pho
tographs of landscapes and people.
Even colored photographs were ex
hibited, and these, like the rest, were
remarkably clearly defined.
Not only do these plant-eyes see
w r ell, but the rays of light which by
means of them are focused on the in
terior of the leaf are carried to the
brain of the plant and affect its sub
sequent movements.
It has long been known that the
leaves of plants move so that they
can get the maximum of light, and
the process is almost identical with
the movements of animals, but this
close analysis of the eyes in plants
proves them to be highly developed
organs. —Dodson Times.
COTTON STALKS FOR PAPER.
Developments in Experiments on
Such Work Are Shown.
Washington. Positive develop
ments in investigation and experi
ments conducted with a view of util
izing cotton stalks in the manufac
ture of paper are slow. While the
department of agriculture has had a
representative investigating the pro
cess of a Chicago man for making
paper from cotton stalks, no official
report on the subject has been made.
Meanwhile, the inventor makes the
positive claim that excellent paper at
moderate cost may be made from cot
ton stalks.
The department of agriculture is
continuing experiments with a view
to developing means of lessening the
drain upon the forests for the manu
facture of wood pulp. The forest
service is just now turning its atten
tion to the utilization of sawmill
Jeffersonian.
waste for this purpose. The wood
used for pulp last year amounted to
4,000,000 cords, approximately, and it
is estimated that the amount of waste,
including slabs and blocks burned or
given away at sawmills, amounted to
4,500,000 cords.
Here is a field for American in
ventors who are performing wonder
ful feats in other directions. If they
should get down to business and show
pulp makers the way to use waste
slabs in the manufacture of paper
they would confer a blessing upon the
country and the world. Work along
this line would also be likely to show
the way for utilization of thousands
of tons of sawdust which are now
wasted each year.
Some utilization is being made of
mill waste at present, but in most
cases it is only the larger and more
modern plants that are even making
any attempts in this line. Then, as it
is, the plants which use the waste
slabs, after laths are made, often
waste the sawdust, and those which
use the sawdust waste the slabs. The
slab residue from the lumber cut of
the country is estimated to amount
to about 14,000,000 cords, of which
about 6,000,000, with an average val
ue'of $1.40 a cord, is sold for fuel,
3,500,000 burned by the mills for fuel
and 4,500,000 sent to the refuse
burners. This last figure shows the
enormous quantity of forest product
that is pure waste.
Slag heaps at iron furnaces have
been seized upon by the brick mak
er, and the screening dump of the
coal mines has become a valuable
source of raw material for the bri
quette manufacture. Experts say
that it may prove possible to make
just as good use of the waste heaps
of the lumber mills if slabs and saw
dust can be converted into pulp.—
National Co-Operator and Farm Jour

Milk and meat and work are had
more cheaply from the farm pastures
than from any other source. It has
been observed that pasture land in
creases jn a neighborhood as farm
help becomes scarce. Cultivated
crops reduce organic matter in the
soil and render it unfit for profitable
grain production. Pasturing replaces
this organic matter. Barnyard ma
nure will replace organic matter as
far as it goes, but there is never
enough of it on any farm. When
good crops of grain are wanted, a
pasture that is plowed and reduced
in the proper condition is the best
place to get them. Corn and wheat
forever will destroy the productive
ness of any soil. —Farmers’ Advo
