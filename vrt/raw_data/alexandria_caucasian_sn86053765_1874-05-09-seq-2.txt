The citizens of thgs.e States are
knocking at the doors ..of Congress
demanding relief, at the handsief
the Federal Government. Both

tioTi< The memorial of the South

still before the Judiciary committee
„of the House, but it is useless to
hope for any action of Congress, as
the only relief it could give, would
be to undo the wrong it lias perpe
trated by its Reconstruction acts.
This the Ilepnblican party at the
present time will no6 do—South
Caroliua is at fî»e merçy of th.e tnosl

tire book of James S. Tike, who
was sent by the New York Tribune
.to that State, in the winter rtf 3871Î
and 1873, to observe the "actual po
litical situation in that State, as
giving a true picture- of its present
government. Mr. Pike is a Repub

conglomerate, gathered from „the ranks
of its-owii servile population. Jt is the
pectacle of a sociefy suddenly turned

The Veto.
o
The qnestio« of inflation .has at last
broug ht, the East, and West face to face in. a
ooutest. in which the West eaimo't. afford to
accept a compromise, and the East is nil
willing to relinquish her grasp of a power
more nranipotant than that of numbers—
evan in this government professing to be
governed by majorities. It is the contest
between cgpital and labor. The East rep
resents the one, and the West the other.
It is virtually asking: shall we have cheap
money and high wages, ami rninuneratinj*
prices for produce, or shalè we have low
wages and low priced and dear money?
•That the division between the opponents
[>iul supporters of -inflation is sectional—
clearly reveals that this is the light in
which the uieasn.re is regarded. With the
West, it is not merely a cptçstion of dol
lars and cents, bnt of ireedom. There is
no power in a government more potent
than that of the currency. " Joseph with
the granaries of Egypt iu his banc], in the
midst of tlie seven years fanji'ive was^iot
more potent, than the East will be over
the destinies r> f the Wcst.^if this money
fjimijie is continued. It. is in vain to po.int
to the liafciks of .New .York, Boston., and
Phiftnlelpftia plethoric with greenbacks,
to provefthat there is no famine. Joseph"
could with enual foree. have proved that.
L & • .
•there was no famine i;i Egypt; by point"
iug fo the overloaded granaries of her cit
ies.. ÏÉ is not sufficient that there sJiould
be enough tcsnpply tlie necessities of life,•
there must ]>e enough to maka these hoard
e<l treasures sell at living prices, and in
vest in something jplse. than the freedom
Ind liberties of thé toiling millions It
is not. the first time in which thiaquestion
has involved the destiny and liberties of a
peopje. There" is no error more fallacious
than tlio theory that the prosperity of a
nation is inseparable from currency, con
vert.ilde i(gto gold and silver, and no blun
lier so cwstly, as the arbitrary contraction
of the currency, to reach a limit within
which-it maybe redeemed. It would be
much wiser to let this matter be adjusted
by commerce. That our government
should ba^e made this latter blunder, pud
intertained the errors whicl# led *to it in
the face of history and her own history is
surprising.
It "is Troll known'that the Rank of Eng*
land suspended in 1707. and did not return
to specie paymcnfc®nntil 1S22 That dur
ing that period of twenty-five years, she
was Hooded with Bank paper, and in spite
of the_ most gigautra and expensive war,
her improvement 4.' 1 wealth and power
other twenty-five years of her existence
The issuing of this bank paper was not the
result of statesmanship but of necessity.
The same result followed the issue of
Greenbacks in this country.- They were
I issued in defiance of Sill our ideas of an
had tçipled, and quadrupled, that of any
I
! ov< " r until they were bke in number
to the leaves of Autumn, and in'spiteof

, ,
i to the belief that, tue bann paper or green
j 1>acks wonM . m1ecI11?<l in Ro]l i. fl , rno
jnne in England and America believed any
jsueh thing. Under the delusion that the

.Bent eentinued to contract Hie currency to
, • - f - (! ■ .
bring it within the redemption of specie
payments, and the "bank finally resumed
in 18'22'^I5uf, this contraction caused in
seven years of peace, more mill and deso
lat ion than the ravages arid waste of twen
ty yearnfjof war." The wings of her mighty
commerce, which under the stimulus of
lier increased currency, ha'd swept over the
world, seemed smitten with patsy. Her
ships roted in her docks; enterprise per
ished, great commercial houses one after
another failed. Thousands were reduced
from affluence to poverty, universal bank
ruptcy prevailed and tens of thousands
begged for bread. So great was the dis
tress that the Government had to invoke
the aid of the military, to repress the in
surrections it had caused. Our. distress
has not reached such a point of exaspera
tion, but ik has produced symptoms in the
West—and among the laboring classes,
looking very much in th@direction. The
history of our finance since the war has
been entirely similar to fm'at. of England
Our government; has been possessed with
the same insane idea of returning®to spe"
eie payments by the arbitrary means, of
contracting the currency instead of devcl
opingjjhe energies of our commerce, our
mannnieturies, our agriculture and other
industries, by fnriSidiing cheap money or
rather by letting, cheap money alone.
Under-this contraction, the last four years
of poace, have produced more bankruptcy
than four years of war. Every where we
see the usual results of f?<?ar money and
cheap labor. The capitalist is growing
richer, and the laborer and producer poor
er. A1I great enterprises are stopped—the
laborer every where finds it difficult to
earn the necessaries of life; manufactures
Q
are unau|ç to maintain themselves. The
great We'st in spite of lier bursting barns,
is growing poorer;" and unless there is a
change, must soon give up their lands and
houses, to the :r.o:;.~y Pharaohs of New
York, Hoston and Philadelphia. Mr. Alii
son says tire greatest misfortunes a people
can meet with, isthat their enterprise and
commerce should outstrip their currency.
We are on the eve of demonstrating its
truth and unh 3S something is done to rem
edy the President's veto of the Finance
bill: its desolation over the West, will lei
as great and more permanent than the
inarch of his armies over the plains and
mountains of Virginia; and the conquest
of " t ? e w f Bi h ? *» ; e East, will be as ihor
oii^n ana as permanent as bas been that
[of his armies over the lallen Smith.

coutroling the labor of the», parish
and in „ breaking down the high
rates of interests charged the plan
ters by the New Orleans commis

a-great work, and we suppose that
these are its principal objects. We
have no idea that they seek to in

Reconstruction in the Scntb.
It is a liopefnl sign of the times
when the Bepublican press of the
North acknowledges the error of
reconstruction, and calls Upon Con
gress antl the Republican party to
give relief to one of the reconstruct
ed States, and save it from the de
plorable condition in which it has
been placed by its enfranchised ne
gro voters, who wield the political
power, and persistently refuse to
the tax-payers 0 a fair representation
for the protection of their property
and interest. We extract the. fol
lowing from Harper's Weekly of
May Ud:
When the Republican party adopted the
policy of reconstrution which the sifitin
tion demanded, it was sert and frankly
acknowledged that great, risks were
taken. One of the the most obvious was
tlie possible mastery of the new 1 majority
ot til« voters by sharpérà and démagogues,
who would-mask -all their -action under
the name of the patty, and represent all
opposition or proceeding from sullen re»
bels. This is wfiat wc now see. Aildcan
nothing be done? Are now Resource • ex
hausted in saying t.hafc it is all very sad.
and that.Tiotbing can be done about it 1 ?
Tlie fundamental conditions of *rec »nstruc
tion, especially equal sutfrJlgf. i ts' corne r
sfonte, will <*f course remain unchanged.
Jiut, why should Qojigress, or the Presi
dent, or the intelligence "of the Repultli
can"party be deaf oj.blind to the serions
suffering and wrong which undeniably
exists iu the Stat»? It is from ihein,
from the dominant party, -that relief can
alone come. For the situation is such, as
V5« have l>efore- represented, that if the
colored voters could have plain evidence
that the Republican party of the coiuitry f
the Executive, and Congress did not sus
tain nor approve the leaders who mis
manage the Stata, and if this conld Le
certified to them by the character and
acts of the officers ef the general goren»-,
inent in the State, the begining ef relief
would be pereeptiable. The remedy is
not a matter of theory, but of practical
stirtemanship, of skillful administration.
It the President and Congress were firmly
resolved that the enormous corruption and
misrule in South Caroliua should ceasa,
tlieit disposition would soon bo known in
the State, and every, honest patriotic
citizen in it would be inspired to co oper
ate heartily. First for the welfare of the
country, then for the interest« et' the par
ty, the Administration should range itself
in sympathy with those who are wronged
in Pmitli Carolina, and to thisend we hupe
that the Judiciary Committee will recom
mend the investigation which is asked.
The same paper commenting on
the political situation and the de
feat of tire Kepublican party in Now
| Hampshire and Connecticut, sa
Tin 1 peril of this protecting and in
uiffeient attitude, however, is evident
enough. It is seen in Connecticut.
Tlie Republican - passivity "gives the
day to the Denioerais. The general
opinion < l f the Slate" may be Kepubli
can, but it is votes that decides elec
tions. Yet. the responsibility for the
possivi'y, and for ;tll that Hows from
it, is with the party implicated in the
Credit. Mobitiér - T with those who passed
the salary grab, and who made the
moieties and the Zaubern contracts
possible; who are blind and deaf to
Louisiana and South Carolina; who
violat.a by inflation the plighted nation
al faith and the Solemn pledges of the
party. The Republican party iroiw
töofi to i was the conscience and
intelligence of the country politically
organized. Of such a gentlemen as
General I îutlkr a?id Jli. C amêuon can
not, be representative leaders. When
it is phtin that they and their political
morality and me'liodsare really the law
of the party,- the party «ill be broken
and virtually destroyed. The inflation
bill that has. posstd Congress, sup
ported by Mr. M outon and Mr. C am
kuon , has dealt a terrriblc blow jftrthe
party unity. ? Under Mr. M orton's
lead, and with Mr. B utler's aid, a
Republican Congress has proclaimed a
national financial policy which seems
to the mind and conscience of the par
ty a debasting lie. Does Congress
wonder at the passivity of Republi
cans ?
