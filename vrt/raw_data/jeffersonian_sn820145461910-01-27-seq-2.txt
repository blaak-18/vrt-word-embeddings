That Ovation to Booker Washington
IHE ovation given to Booker T.
Washington in Atlanta, the
other day, at which one thou
' sand white people assisted —
accompanied, as it was, with a blare
of trumpets, and signalized by an in
troductory speech by one of the most
prominent white preachers in the
country—is calculated to give think
ing Southern men pause.
Such a demonstration in honor of
a negro was impossible—even in At
lanta—a few y»ars ago. It had not
been very long since Washington
visited that city upon the invitation
of its leading negro citizens, for the
purpose of expounding his views on
the race question. How many white
men heard him then?
At least one obscure citizen of the
State—whose presence in a negro
meeting at which Washington was
the center of attraction would not
have caused a ripple on the surface of
social or political life —decided, after
earnest debate with himself, that he
could not defy acknowledged public
opinion in Georgia by attending that
negro meeting, held in the interest of
negroes—even though his sole pur
pose in wishing to do so was to
reach some conclusions as to Wash
ington’s real character and mission
as an evangel of negro elevation.
Well-remembered incidents which
marked that occasion prove that
other white men in Georgia—men of
the largest sympathy for the well
being of the negro, real friends of
the race—whose presence would
have drawn wide attention to the
affair, and would" have lifted Wash
ington’s visit into national promi
nence—thought “discretion the bet
ter part of valor”—and prudently
remained away.
On that occasion Washington
spoke the same sentiments—and
with the same frankness and force
—that he uttered on his latest visit.
He was as much a national figure at
that time as he is now. Before that
visit Andrew Carnegie, who is known
to have coined his millions by mulct
ing the people of the whole country
through the operations of the ini
quitous tariff, had endowed Wash
ington’s school at Tuskegee with
sums that any struggling white
school in the South would have con
sidered fabulous. He had gone fur
ther and settled upon Washington
and his family an estate that made
him one of the country’s very rich
men.
Unless my memory is terribly at
fault, prior to that former visit by
Washington to Atlanta, he had be
come a frequent caller at the White
House. According to advices pub
lished broadcast over the country, he
controlled the Presidential patron
age of the South. Whom he would
he set up; and whom he would he
cast down. To cap the climax and
lift him to the very pinnacle of
prominence, he had pushed his legs
under the White House mahogany
and lunched with President Roose
velt. •
Certain it is, this negro was as
good and as great a man then as
when he again invades Georgia’s
capital on the same mission—this
time to the beating of drums, and
the blowing of trumpets—when one
thousand white folks of the city as
sist at his reception and rapturously
applaud his speech. Certain it is, he
brought the same message then as
now. He was then, as he is now, the
apostle of negro independence
through, industry, thrift, and self
reliant energy. That was Washing
ton’s gospel then; that is Washing
ton’s gospel now. He is no abler or
better man today than he was ten
years ago. He is no saner or safer
counselor of his race; he is no truer
friend to the white race.
Why this difference in 1910?
Is it due to the softening of race
prejudice by the healing touch of
time? Is there less of friction be
tween the races in the South today
than there was ten years ago? Is
the problem of the two distinct races
—with a spiritual distance between
them of more than three thousand
years—living together—in the same
country, under the same laws, en
joying the same political and civic
rights—and yet as far apart as the
poles;—is this, the greatest prob
lem that ever tried the strength of
any civilization, any nearer a solu
tion now than ten, twenty, thirty
years ago?
What Southern white man be
lieves it?
Again, I ask, why this marked
difference in the two visits?
You will not find any cleavage
in the view’s of Booker T. Washing
ton. Look not for it in any evolu
tion that education has wrought in
the negro. You will search in vain
for it in the gradual drawing to
gether of the races in the South.
Union was possible when Norman
and Saxon dwelt together on Eng
lish soil —first as the bitterest of
foes, then as brothers. Both of
those races were white—both Saxon.
How utterly different the case in
the South! The negro is a negro in
1910 as surely, and as perfectly, as
he was in 1865; and the Southern
white man is as white as he was
then. His blood is as red; his pride
in race is as keen; his sense of
power is as strong; and his determi
nation to hold forever, and at all
hazards, the inheritance left him by
his fathers is as deep-seated as ever.
Once again, how is this wonderful
difference in the external features
of Washington’s two visits to At
lanta to be explained?
Listen, men of the South.
That Atlanta ovation to the negro
Washington—with all the noisy hur
rah by whites, and blowing of brass
horns by the Fifth Regiment Band,
and the introduction of the speaker,
in polished phrase, by a leading min
ister of one of the most prominent
white churches in Georgia, is but an
other chapter added to the educa
tional and social propaganda that is
being insidiously and industriously
exploited by the General Education
Board. It is a part of the scheme,
originating with certain multi-mil
lionaire negrophiles of the North, to
break down the barriers, educational
and social, between the white and
black races.
There you have the primal cause
of Washington’s visit. There you must
look for the real significance of the
Atlanta meeting in the Atlanta Audi-
731) e Jeffersonian
torium-Armory, with all its fuss and
feathers. There you will find the
true inwardness of the whole thing
—including that outpouring of white
people to hear and applaud this
apostle of negro education.
Not that any white man who sat
in that audience meant, consciously
and purposely, to lend himself to the
propaganda of this educational trust.
No man there had any such thought.
But the effect of that ovation to
Washington by leading white citizens
of Atlanta was to give countenance to
the deep-laid and insidiously conceal
ed plans of the trust. The fact that
this was done unwittingly does not
alter the fact, or lessen its force as a
fact.
I freely acquit the minister who in
troduced the speaker to this mixed
audience of four thousand persons—
one thousand of them whites —of any
purpose to lend encouragement to the
breaking down of those barriers—so
cial and educational—erected by the
instinct of race integrity and Saxon
supremacy. He is a Southern man—
with a Southern man’s pride in his
race, and a Southern man’s preju
dices and love for Southern tradi
tions. But this does not weaken the
contention that for any leading white
minister in Georgia to introduce
Booker Washington to a home audi
ence —one thousand of whom are
whites—can not fail to furnish en
couragement and support to the co
terie of Northern millionaire philan
thropists who have audaciously pro
posed to take over and administer the
educational assets of the South. The
logic of facts can not be set aside by
misguided sentiment.
There are those who see in this
movement of Jno. D. Rockefeller and
his coadjutors in deviltry a fixed
purpose to control the educational
operations of the South, the gravest
menace to what the Southern people
have been taught to hold more sacred
than life itself. More than one pa
triotic voice has been raised in sol
emn warning and emphatic protest.
If I mistake not, the distinguished
introducer of Washington at the late
Atlanta meeting is an avowed apolo
gist in the public prints of the coun
try for the educational trust. He
accepts their propaganda of educa
tion in the South and defends their
course. No matter, then, how pure
his motives in the meeting under re
view, the conclusion can not be es
caped that the effect of that meet
ing, and of the leading part he took
in it, must be to give countenance
to the purposes and policy of the
educational board—with all its al
lied interests and its ulterior ends.
For one, I read in this Atlanta
ovation to Booker Washington by
the white people of the city a yield
ing to the subtle plans and purposes
of Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ogden &
Co., whose millions are being de
voted to shaping the educational
policies of the South, and by this
means to paving the way to the com
plete subversion of that social status
for the negro, which has saved the
South from the fate of Cuba, San
Domingo, and the mongrelized South
American republics. *
I, therefore, look with dread upon
such scenes as witnessed Washing-
ton’s late triumphal entry into the
capital of Georgia. I resent the
sinister motives of the men behind
this educational and social propa
ganda. I want none of their officious
intermeddling with our affairs—edu
cational, social, or religious.
And in this sweeping generaliza
tion I include the hookworm crusade
—that also has its head-center in the
city of Atlanta. Let us have poverty,
ignorance, unthrift, hookworm evil
and all—if in getting rid of these we
are forced to give up our birthright.

rich, yet hath nothing; there is that

riches.”
