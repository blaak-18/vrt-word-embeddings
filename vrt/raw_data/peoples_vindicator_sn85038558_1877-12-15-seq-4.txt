OUR WAHSINGTOO N LEFTER. AIM
WVa teNT, roD. C., Nov. 30, 1s77. . How
cilnator Conover, of Floridla, whlio
1ans been eat p.t-bagging within the As
1)emnocratic lines, on W-ednesd' t- see -
turned to his home atnlkg the Rlbpub
lieans and toted on tiiat day :mi yes- their
ferday to take up the Kellogg case in to in
advance of that of lthtlers. This pre. pirC
vented what was contrtidtly antici- int
pated for W'Nednesday-llitle l' ad
mission. What may he done before to it
adjournment to-day oP to-night no
one can tell. It is certlain only thati ire
no human being can tell whether But left
ler will he adm itted or not, or Kel- is tc
logg. Both may be. There is talk of o i
an arrangemett by which lnit hr and ~I
Enustis, lh-mocitats, and Kellogg, lHe
publican, may be sworn in at the tet
same time, and this scleme has that
friends in both paticts. can
So great was the interest in this
question that the .Senate retaited in saI
session yesterday from 12 mi. to 5 p. thet
ni., after each party had been in cani- It
cns all the morning. This desecration smer
of a day officially set apart for better say
things was appronp iately punished by of
leaving the olbject of the session fur- that
ther than ever from a settlement, if mu'
that is possible. cnil
Several counfirmations were made wot
In executive session, and among oth- lnd
ers was that of Gen. larlan as .ins- in
tice of the Supreme Court. There ed 1
was a motion to reconsider, however, less
owing, ostensibly to the fact that the spl
chairman of the Judiciary Commnnittee, liab
Edmonds, was not present when the sor
vote for confirmation was taken. It plti
is believed that Harlan will be final- as
ly confirmed thouglh it is kniowi thant ym
Edmonds has objections. The con- wil
firmation yesterhay, in his absence tli
and the reconsideration, were ev- slit
fdently part of ait attemptt to bull iit
doze that Senator, as, if HIarlani's 1)b
nomination is now rejected, it will be cal
certainly known that Edimonds is res- po
ponsible for such rejection and the as
friends of Harlan do not believe Ed- by
monds will care to have the record
made up in that way. up
In the House nothing is being done, th
beyond the presentation of bills, reso- fit
Tltions, &c., which n ill not be acted dr
en until the regular session coim- he
inences. This nill be on Monday do
next. se
There is a belief among radical adl
Republican Senators that the terrible ph
Mr. Hayes has a finger in the Senato- su
rial quarrel. So far as I have seen fa
there is not the slightest ground for
qucll a belief, unless one or two er- m
ratic votes of Senator Stanley Mat- ei
thews may be so considered. But as to
Senator Matthews evidently consid- at
ers Mr. Hayes as a mere incident, and ce
himself as the main object in the palh- n,
lie eye, and the one pivot upon which to
the political universe turns, it is tl
Ilardly fair to hold Mr. Hayes respon- w
Bible for what the Senator may do or w
eay. Hie has sins enough of his own, al
mixied up with what has been manly al
and honorable in his Presidential tl
course, without making him respon- nI
sible for the irregularities or eccen- tl
tricities of others. He has to all ap- 1l
pearances, kept himself properly to
clean from all entanglements in this o
purely legislative squable. n
The appropriation for the Paris ex- tt
hibition may, after all, be lost. After
the bill passed the House the Senate el
Committee reported it with amend- p
maeats. No action Ihas been taken I
since, and it is thought thie bill can
not be disposed of in the Senate soon
enough to have the Ihonse act upon v
It. There is a decided majority in r
both bodies favorable to an appropri- c
ation.
From time to time, Secretary Evarts e
gives to the public, indirectly, his
opiDnitn 'that we shtlli 'i' halve I
a war with- Mexie ' """Yt the
opinion always comes coupled withl
information which seems to make war
the likeliest thing to happen. The
troops of both the United States and I
Mexico are concentrating on the bor
der1 and that is significant of evil.
Senator Gordon yesterday spoke in
the Senate, replying to Senator Conk
lie. The latter Senator has that
ateadnt of personal vanity wlnch
would never permit him to see that
he is defeated, but in yesterdays
speeches, the Georgia Senator cer
tainly left a far better impression up
on his hearers than Conkling did. It
was not a pitched battle, like that be
tween Blaine anid Conkling in the
House ocf Representatives several
years ago in which Blaine was so ea
sily the victor, but it was enough to
show thie superior tact and readiness
of Senator Gordon.

Therefore we say to the next Legisla

name of common justice, amend these

our people need all the relief they can
get. We ask it for them. And what we
ask is nothing more than simple justice.

As ianny persons seem to try to 01' t
see how little fruit they can make
their apples trees bear, and also seem
to take pride ill growing worthless .
vaiieties, I will give such men a few
hints to aid then in their endeavors
to rcender their orehards of no value: T 1H-1
First, crop the land where the tices sle
iare to he set till there is no fertility this no
It-t in it. A good test of that state with (.
is to plant a few hill of white beans I'000t.
f on it ; andl if it fails to grow any polls 'tI "I
Sof these beans, the land is in the CIE
riight condition. Next see that the
' fences are down around the field, so r
that your own and neighbors' cattle (onsist
can cotmle in when the trees are plant
` ed, and browse on themn, which will
save you the expense of trimming
º thenm once a year.
In buying your trees ask your nur
n seryman if lie has a "cheanl hlot" and
r say you are setting trees for the use
of others when you are dead, and LHRO0
that you are not going to pay out
if lunch money for thnm ; and he will LA1)11
call your attention, pirobably, to a
l worthless lot of trees, not labeled,
- and such as will suit you exactly, be
;- ing varieties that have been condemIn- ool
' ed by horticultural societies as worth- 00'1'
, less. lie will say: "Yes, here is a
tC splendid lot of fine, ttraight trees
'a, labels are lost-got mixed-excellent
IC sorts-will, sell them at your own Cloy
t price." Such trees you can get "for
ia song ;" and while you are alive, as ment.
at o.'nu are well advanced in years, it
n- will be just the same as if they were Cr
cI the best varieties in existence, so you
- should order your nurseryman to dig
11i them ip, and you " ill come for them. A
's Don't tell him to have thenu dug up
be carefully, and with as many roots as Ga O(
s- possible, because you want the load Bo(
le as smnall as possible, and short, shab- In
d- by roots are easily set.
d When you get the trees loaded A FR
upon your wagon, don't throw any- alaht
e, tlhing over the roots to keep tl:em cit
i- from the rays of the sun, and tihe Rig
d drying wind ; and when you getp
iho- home, select a sunny place to throw mlo
ly down the trees, and be sure not to ieMai
set them till next day. If any one -
cal advises you to "heel ill" the tree till
We planted, tell them you have heard of
to- such bosh before from the "book
!en farmers."
for In setting the trees, let your hired
er- man do it, while you take the world
at- easy at the village tavern. Tell him
as to dig the holes as small as possible,
iid- and not let the roots in; that if they
Ind can't go in spread out as they grew STE
i(,- naturally, to curl them up in a circle, sate
ich to put the yellow, lower earth around
is the roots, and the dark, fertile soil Is
n- where it does not come in conta, t 'telo
or with them in the least. You should
a n, also tell him not to be particular Fe
mly about filling in the cavities between
tial the roots, also not to press the earth
nu- upon them, and be sure not to water
en- the trees, unless a rain setsin. Last
ap- ly, say to him: "John, I want you
rly to hurry up this work. There are
Aiis only one hundred trees to set, and I
will give you till six o'clock to-night
ex- to set them."
fter Another point: You have undoubt
late edly read or beard that it is a good
nd- plan to manure and cultivate the
ken land where your trees are set, but
fn- don't do it, because this advice is
oon found in the papers; and you don't
pon want to fidlow any such unreliable
in rules for the management of an or
ri- chard. .It your father or grandfather
did a thing, you slhould follow their
arts examples. Above all, don't subscribe 5
his for an agricultural or a horticultural
ave paper, as they cost from one to two 4
the dollars a year, and for that sum you

I. It carried out by rains. In a soil well
i be- drained and friable water has less
the effect ii carrying away such con
veral stituents than in soils where it is lon
o ea- ger held. And in such hand the wa
gh to ter gives up to the soil ammonia, pot
iness ash, phoslphoric and silicic acid,
which it holds in solution. In rela
N. tion to this question Liebig says:
"Rainwater filtered through field or
garden soil does not dissolve out a
trace of potash, silicic acid, ammo- el
isla- nia, or phosphoric acid. Thire soil
rkiig does not give up to the water one
se, n particle of the food of plants which ly
i the It contains. The most continnons
these rain cannot remove from the field, ft
nows except mechanically, any of thIe es- ((
ia . sential constituents of its fertility."

Take a leg or shin of beef, put it to
boil in a gallon of water-or if very
ikiing large in a gallon and a half; boil it
e btisteadily, but not fast, until all tirhe
stl etrengthl is boiled from tile meat;
Sin- tlien strain it and put it" to cool, when
the fat mrust be skimnimed off and the
jelly can be taken out in small por
tions when sonp is needed, and the
vegetables added, or whatever is lik
ien of ed for variety; but if the vegetables
ot to are boiled with thire stock it is apt to
Spur- become seur by keeping. Should thee
t pro- stook be wanted brown it is' well to
