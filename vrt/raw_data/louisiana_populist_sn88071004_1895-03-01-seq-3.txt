The Right Kind of Talk.
The Democrat-Jonrnal makes
tie following statement which will *
bear repeating for the good there o
is in it: "A drummer for is print- ,
ing house in a certain city solicited e
some job work from Mlr. B. Willer, 2
one of our merchants, the other a
d(ay but did not get the order, al a
though Mr. Wilier wanted some
work done at the time. Mir. Wil- I
ler said that he preferred patron- o
izing home indrustry and would
give his work to this office, because -
those connected with the Demo
"crat-Jonrnal spent their money
here and deserved patronage. Mr.
Willer in this affair, showed the
spirit ot an enterprising and pub
lic spirited man, one who is willing
to assist his neighbors in their bus F
iness. Those connected with our
office spend $1000 or $1200 in the
place yearly and for that reason
alone, if there were no other, they -
are entitled to more recognition
than they get. The paper is ex
pected to work for the town, but
some of those most interested do
not think our services are worthy
of recognition."
Carry a Level Head.
The storekeeper who expects to
do much business in 1895 must (
practice the lesson taught in the
following story: Two frogs found
themselves in a pail of milk and
they could not jump out. One of
them was for giving up and said to
the other, Good by; I sink, I die.
Said his mate, Brace up, you duf
fer! Keep a jumpin, and see
what turns up. So they kept
jumping up and down all night and
by morning had so churned the
milk that it turned to butter, and
they jumped off the butter to the
ground.
Applied to business the fable
means this: If you want the bu
siness of 1895 to exceed that of
1894 keep a jumpin. Don't cry, I
sink, I die! The merchant who
continues looking for bad times4
will not deserve to see good times.
The man who keeps a jumpin' will
see good times first. Carry a level
head, buy standard goods and keep
a good clean, stock, and attractive
store and advertise with bright, at
tractive ads.-Facts and Figures.
