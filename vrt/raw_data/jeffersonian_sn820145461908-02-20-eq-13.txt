Weak
Heart Action
There are certain nerves
that control the action
of the heart. When they
become weak, the heart
action is impaired. Short
breath, pain around heart,
choking sensation, palpi
tation, fluttering, feeble
or rapid pulse, and other
distressing symptoms fol
low. Dr. Miles Heart Cure
is a medicine especially
adapted to the needs of
these nerves and the mus
cular structure of the
heart itself. It is a
strengthening tonic that
brings speedy relief.
Try it.
“For years I suffered with what I
thought was stomach trouble, when
the doctors told me I had heart
trouble. I had tried many remedies,
when the Dr. Miles’ almanac came
into my hands, and I concluded to
try Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure. I have
taken three bottles, and now I am
not suffering at all. I am cured and
this medicine did it. I write this in
the hope that it will attract the at
tention of others who suffer as I did.”
