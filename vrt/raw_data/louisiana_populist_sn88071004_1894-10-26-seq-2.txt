ENGLISH OPPRESSION.
Can You See Any Significance in
This?
The first attempt by England to
oppress the American people was
the stamp act, which was passed by
the English Parliament in England
in 17t;5; the second attempt was in
the funding act of the Anglo
American parliament in 1865, just
one hundred years later. The his
tory intervening between these two
important epochs of American ex
istence is well known to all histori
cal students, therefore it is un
necessary to mention any but the
most salient facts connected with
resulta- The American citizen of
course, revolted at the idea of a
foreign government collecting trib
ute from a people that have all
natural rights to be free, and the
consequence was that the people
then patriotically responded to the
sall, to arms, to put down British
tyranny, (they had no ballots to
fight with) and the result after a
long and bloody war was the dear
ly bought liberty that proclaimed
to the world that henceforth Ameri
cans were to be a free people. We
alo find that as long as those pa
triots lived, these high priced lib
erties were guarded with a vigil
sace that has been the pride of this
eountry. After two unsuccessful
attempts to subdue this country by
her ow army and aay, England
bocame convinoed that it was a
fruitlmes and reckless waste of her
mn asd memns. Then to sruoesed
se mnst adopt some other course,
sa in castiag about for a scheme
to aseomplish these ends abshe tbl
upon the system of Snancial mani
pulation to bring her unruly sub
jpes(the Amercan. people) into
bjeaston. Of course, two war

this result she must bring about
a dissension in the United States
that would force the masses through
the advice and influence of leaders
(who did not face bull,,ts) to kill
each other. This, of course, was
a terrible foundation upon which
to build the money aristocracy of
America, but it must be had, the
debt must be created, and it was.
Hardly had the smnolk of battle
cleared away when we see the tools
of these conspirators (the patriots
having died) rapidly fastening the
shackles of slavery upon the peo
ple of this country. These shy
locks had already failed (on account
of that grand old patriot Abrah:ln
Lincoln) to create the bonded in
debtedness of the United States
as the war progressed, but the
money (greenbacks) issued to carry
on the war was still extant, and
made the people prosperous. This
vast amount of money must bh
funded and put into interest bear
ing bonds, hence this second act of
English legislation.
Starvation, raggedness, death,
idleness and prostitution has been
rife in the United States as a re
sult of this legislation. The peo
ple have in some instances feebly
resisted these oppressions, but up
to date the hired tools of these En
glish money lords have succeeded
in keeping the people divided and
lighting each other over old war is
sues, negro domination in the
South, and above all the tariff
question, while these shylocks have
persistently and effectively continu
ed to rob the people by a shrink
age in value of property and pro
duce. The tariff question is never
intended to be settled so long as it
will remain a successful subterfuge
to deceive the people, the only ab
solute evidence that the people
have as to their condition, is that
this shrinkage of value has continu
ed since 1865. This they know to
be a fact, and during this time we
have had low tariff and high tariff,
and yet the shrinkage continues.
The solution is not to be found out
side of the financial issue, and this
will not be done until the people
see their interest and unite. The
strike has been tried, but the for
eigner is permitted to keep an ar
my of hired thugs to shoot down
the laborer who was contending for
his rights, and when the hired pri
vate army of these shylocks were
found insufficient, the United States
army was put at their command,
and innocent women and children
shot down for no other reason than
that they were in the scramble for
work or bread. The English mon
ey power has absolute control over
the people of this country, and
they now use the United States
army to subjugate American citi
zens, something that they have
failed to do with their own army
after two unsucessful attempts.
Can you, my countrymen, look
these conditions in the face and re
main unmoved 9 Can you contem

OF THE P'FOPLE'5 PAIRT, 19 COlNIMER
C(IAL ALLG.
NEW ORtL" XNS, La., Oct. 15. 18,94.
To the Voters of I.ouisiana:
Believing in the correctness of the
doctrin e. "Fternal \igilance is the price
of !ilhrtv." I venture :'t offer n\ ords of
is arning and advi"ce. ITe p)retsent sad
conditiol, of the industrial masses of the
country demands the exercise of lofty
patriot 'm, if you desire as you should.
the perpetuation of free government and
civil liberty.
The people on the one side and the
plutocrats on the other, are to-day en
gaged in a great struggle. The result
wil, in a great measure determine
whether the producers of wealth shall
enjoy a share of what they create, or
whether their employers through a vic
ious linancfal sy-tem shall continue to
monopolize the fruits of the producers
toil. The fight has already been in part
won by the plutocrats through the par
tial demonetization of silver-the, issu
ance .of $50.00.000 of additional inter
est learing bonds, anl the refusal of the
National aut'horities to take any steps
towards supplying the country with a
circulating medium equal to that of
Firance or about $50 per capita in lieu of
$24, as it is claimed to-day.
The excuse against the free coinage of
silver, at the ratio of 16 to 1, that an in
ternational agreement with foreign na
tios must first be obtained in order to
justify a return to the status of 1873, is
a rsare and a delusion, for such agreement
can never be obtainedt and would not
be permitted by our present rulers if it
could. .Our country is surely large
enough, populous enough and strong
enough to have a silver policy of ifs
own, based upon the needs of our own
people. independerlt of the wishes awl
views of European crown-heads and
capitalists. Whenever there may be
any clash between this American policy
and an European policy, surely the
American not the European policy,
should prevail in these United States.
All true Americans should look to Con
gress alone for the governmental status
of silver in this country, and not to
Lombard street, London Shall we after
118 years of independence consent to
become a mere appendage of the British
crown ?
The plea that silver has so depreciated
in value that the ratio of 16 to 1 should
be at least changed to 20 to 1 before free
coinage is restored is fallacious, because
based upon a falsehood. Silver has not
depreciated, but gold has enhanced;
not through natural causes however, hut
because of pernicious legislation. In
this country the silver dollar has fully
held its own. A single convincing in
stance will suffice. The New Orleans
Democratic press is hostile to the free
coinage of silver, upon the ground of
the great depreciation of the metal, yet
in the face of this, the Picayune, the
Times-Democrat and the States, are to
day giving more papers for one silver
dollar thanc they gave a few years ago
when silver stood in London on a pari
ty with gold. To this they may reply
that their increased circulation has en
ahbled them to put their papers within
reach of the poor man. Well, we pro
pose by increased circulation of silver,
to put the American dollar within reach
of the poor man. In view of the situa
tion I feel that I cannot too strongly
urge upon you to strenuously insist in
this campaign, and in those of 1896, up
on the unconditional and unchanged re
turn of silver to its status of 1878. To
do this with sucess continue your edu
cation as to your rights as freemen. Re
sist the false and perfidious advances of
Democratic and Republican politicians
and demagogues, because their vicious
economic systems are fast reducing our
toilers, laborers, and working men and
women, to a condition of serfdom,
Our position as Popuhlsts is a pecullar
one. For years we have submitted to
outrageous frauds at the ballot boxes.
because of the bughear of negro rule.
Now thatthe time has more than arrir
ed for a stop to these frauds we find the
same frauds used against us, by many
whom we have aided in their political
elevation. Unfaithful servants, they now
refuse us an impartial execution of the
laws. An unquestioned majority of the
Democrats of Louisiana favor the free
coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1,
but are precluded by their leaders from
giving practical manifestation of their
preferences. With these citisens ioee
no opportunity of showing that those
who control the National fortunes of
their party have rendered all hopes of a
restoration of the sttaus of 1878, through
the Democratic party, worse than futile.
If you cannot convince them, labor at
least to secure from them an honest elec
tion.
But with or without their aid, see to it
that the ilutocrat. and their hirelings of
the machine democracy are foiled in all
their attempts at election frands. Pay
no attention to their duplicity and false
pretenses about endangered white su
presacsy. In the Fourth Congressionai
Ditriet they have refused a contest in
white primarie tendered them by the
Popellste; whilst n the Third District
they made the identical tender to the
pubflicaas, and have been in their tarn
re-aed. They clearly want white pri
a-se ely la districts whem they ca
e=s. upon white majoeities, but In the
Erth and Fifth deisees wherr they
shameles"lyv wn by the false counting of
many thousands of stolen negro votes.
JW'hite suprranney with a rengeanci indeed.
1 ,ur duti,. in election day are plain.
Keep at least four reliable Populists at
each and evry poll.' *from its opening to
the close of the count.
Use no threats but stay nevertheless,
and se' andl insist upon a free election
and honest count. If we are to meet
defeat, let it be because we have been
outv-rtedi and not because of a rasehlly
counting out.
In the Black Belt. where at many
ipolls you may not have four men to de
tail, supply the deficiency from the polls
with men \\ 1o have vot'id, as early I:
practicable. Where you ha*.' not l
ready organize.,I do so at once, it ie ner
er too late to do good work of that kind.
Protest against all wrong doing and

The welfare of generations yet un

your final success.

"The tariff question assumed
threatening proportions in 1.32.
In the spring of that year a bill
was passed in Congress increasing
the duties on imported merchan
dise. South Carolina at once took
decided steps in opposition to this
measure. A State convention was
called which declared the act un
constitutional, and therefore null
and void. It advised that the col
lection of duties at the port of
Charleston should lx. resisted by
arms, if necessary. The State leg
islature endorsed the action of the
convention, and a conflict of force
seemed probable.
Jackson, however, acting with
his natural promptitude, and ener
gy, issued a proclamation in which
he denied the right of any State to
nullify an act of Congress. He
followed this up by sending a man
of war to Charleston, and ordering
General Scott there with troops.
These active measures were suffi
cient to prevent the threatened
danger."
Some of our Democratic friends
have been trying to use this action
of Jackson as a precedent in justi
fication of Cleveland's action in
sending troops into Illinois to quell
the Pullman riot. The case of
South Carolina bears no resem
blance to the riot in Illinois. The'
action of South Carolina was a di
rect and open rebellion of a State
government against an act of Con
gress, and in Illinois there was only
a local disturbance in Chicago, and
which the State government was
actively engaged in quelllng, and
at the same time protesting
against the interference of national
troops. There is not the least
paralell in the two cases, and there
is no justification for Cleveland by
way of annalogy or precedent.
Club Organized.
On last Satnurday at Pace's school
house, pursuant to previous notice,
Hon. H. L. Brian addressed a large
assemblage of citizens. Mr. Brian
was detained at Natehitoches,
which delayed him until after the
hour announced, and as a couse
quence, several had left when Mr.
Brian arrived. Notwithstanding
this fact the school house was
crowded, and all the standing roonm
was taken ap. The audience wa
attentive and enthusiastic. After
the speaking a club of sixteen
members was organized with the
following ofcera : I. R. Gentry,
president* W. J. 11oodward, see
retary. This ckhb, was organized
in Ward Four ot Natchitoches iar
ish, and the Populist cause is gaih
ing ground faslt.
To register, and if yea have al
ready registered go and see that
your naime is on the booksa right.
The Registrar will be at the coart
house from now until the eleetion.
Then be sure you go and vote )nd
see your vote counted.
Why He Leot.
(;ENSLEIEN :--l llappearig ll b
fore you as a P'opulist I feel thl:t I
should explain to Iny late DIemo
cratic friends why I leavo them.
That explanation will consist in the
discussion of only one iiuestion-
the (elrlrenc-l--and whether we can
get relief qunickt r in or out of either
of the old parties.
First-:- great majority of the
Southern and Western people are
in favor of the free and unlimited
coiimnage of silver at the ratio of 16
to 1, and there appeiared iii the
Times-I)emocrat of Oct. 21st, all
editorial which is the best argue
inment in a condensed form on that
subject that I have yet read, and
tfr better than I am able to pro
duce. You will excuse me for
reading it to you.
[The editorial referred to is in the
daily Times-Democrat of Oct. 21st,
and it will pay everybody to read
it.--En.l
Now we are asked the question
if it is not better for us to remain
in the I)emnocratic party and pos
sibly get the same relief. My an
swer is no. First, because we have
84 Eastern and Northern Demo
crats now in Congress, and as we
well know they are not in favor of
this measure without coupling with
it restrictions, which virtually des
troy all benefits that are expected
to be derived front this great meas
ure. Second, none of the great
leaders of the Democratic party in
the South or West are in favor of
this bill, on the contrary we have
Mr. Catchings, of Mississippi; Mr.
Morgan and Mr. Oates, of Ala
bama; Mr. Iloke Smith and all the
leaders of Georgia ; Mr. Blackburn
and Mr. Carlisle, of Kentucky, and
our own Messrs. Caffery and Mey.
er, of Louisiana. which are enthus
iastic supporters of Mr. Cleveland
and his ideas, which we all know
to be antagonistic to what we want.
Again every State convention that
has Leen held since the last Con
gress adjourned has endorsed Mr.
Cleveland, and hence his currency
views.
For the above reasons I claim
that we can hope for no relief in
the Democratic party. Now the
question arises, can we get what
we want out of or in a third or new
party My answer is, that is one
thing that every Populist is united
on. I care not whether he be from
North, South or West. Mr. J. P.
Jones, of Nevada, who is regarded
as the best authority on this ques
tion living to-day, says that no
great reform was ever carried out
hi either or any of the old parties,
and you must remember that Mr.
Jones was until lately one of the
Republican parties strongest men.
Again we of the Democratic party
of the South could not have the
effrontery to ask the Northern or
Western Republican to give up the
principles of his party andl come
into the Democratic party. Again
if the Populist can elect, which we
expect to do, a sufficient number to
the next Congress to hold the bal
ance of power, we will have the
deciding vote on all great ques
tions, hence be able to get what we
want without having a majority.
My friends, when such men as
Lyman Trumbull, of Illinois, and
Senator Jones, of Nevada, join
hands with the masses of the peo
pie and leave the two old parties,
I think we have good grounds to
hope that in the near future we
will see our party instead of the
third party in the United States,
the first larty.
Now gentlemen, what we want
you to do is, to go into this fight
to win, and if every man will do
his duty I will guarantee that if
Mr. Bailey does not beat Mr. Og
den, we will scare him so bad that
when he goes to Congress he will
do so mach better than any other
man has ever done from this dis
trict, that we can say to himn, 'Well
done thy good and faithful ser
vant," now come over into our
raunks anid we will send you back in
1896., E. J. GAMBLE.
The Daily States sometime since
remarked that the good to lrow
from Democratic tariff legislation
would be had as soon as' the stuamp
oratr could come around and ex
plain. Now neighbor the people
stand greatly in need of these
great benefits. Let us suggest
that you mend your stamper around
with his delivery wagon.
A GRA(ND RALLI.
Pursuant f, iall there was a :larlg
and enthusiast ii mee.t int of lPopu
lists in the ('ciart IIoui.e at this
place on Tuesday evening, the 2:td
inst. The call vwa nmade for the
purpose of oreganizin, ca entral
ward club. We had a practical and
logical talk from Mr. Gamble, in
which he explained his oliject for
renouncing his allegiance to the
Democratic party, and for joining
the ul'ol lits.
MIr. (;amble wa, followed by
Mr. Brian in a forcible talk upon
the fundamental principles of the
P.eople's party, which was well re
cciv-d by the audience, somne of
whom were l)enr:lcrats.
After the peakiig a leopl,'s
party club of one hundredl and
seven erliolied memblers was organi
zed with E. J. (iamble President;
McK. Holston vice-president. and S
D. Kearney sec·retary. and W. II.
Latham, assistant setretary.. After
the organi/ation. it cnmmittee of
five on arrangements for the has
ket dinner and speaking on Friday,
the 26th inst., wa:s appointed.
The club then unanimously pass
ed a resolution of thanks to Mr.
Greneaux as follows:
Be it resolved, that the thanks of
this body he extended to MIr. W.
S. Greneaux for the honorable
manner in which he treated the
People's party of this parish by
the appointment of People's party
commissioners of election.
That a copy of this resolution beo
published in the LOUIsIANA PoPu
I rST, and one he presented to Mr.
Greneaux. Unanimously adopted..
There being no further business,
the <dlub then adjourned subject to
call of president.
E. J. GAMBLE,
S. D. KEARNEY. President.
Secretary.
Another Rally.
Maj. A. L. Cox addressed a large
and enthusiastic audience at Mont
gomery, La., on the 17th inst. Ili.
discourse was principally upon the
platform of the People's party.
While the )emocrats halu made
two efforts to have public speaking
at this place, and failed to get any
audience, the People's party speak
er had an audience that filled the
iMontgomery high school building.
This shows how the Populists are
dying out.
Is It Providenoe?
Judge Lyman Trumbull, a ne
convert to the People's party, with
his own hands wrote the 13th
amendment to the constitution that
freed four millions of black slaves.
He was then a Republican. Is he
now to write another amendhnent
that will free millions of black arnd
white slaves? He isfound on that
side in a very opportune time.

The panic which begun in 1837,
was relieved by the issuance of

population was 17,000,000. The
cause of the panic was the hanks
withholding their money and as

relieved. Why can't it be done
