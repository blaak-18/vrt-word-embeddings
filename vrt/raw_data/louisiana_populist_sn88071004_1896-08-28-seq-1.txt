FINANCE
1. We demtandtl a national i oney.
safe and sound, issued by the g.iierala
overnuent only, without the inteorveln
tion of bank, of issue, to he a full legal
tender for debt,, public ant pri vate, an-l
a juti. equitable and ellhiient means of
distribution diret to the peoe al ant
through the lawful disbursements of the
goverllnment,
2. We demand the free and unrie
strieted eoinage of silver and gold at
the present legal ratio of ei tbo 1. w th

an amount suficient t') mn°'et the. le
mandts of the husine.s piopulationl of
this country and to restore the just level
of prices of labor and prhlutiton.
4. We denounee the sah' of ians
and the inerp rhe of the pulii inteirest
bearing bonded debt made iby the preiient
administration, as unneassary and1 with
out authority of law. and dnemand that
no more bonds be issued except byI a
specific act of congress.
L,5. We demand such legal legislation
as will prevent the demonetizatzation of
the lawful money of the United States
by private contract.
t. We de'mand that the goverumnent
in payment of its obligations shall use
its option as to the kind of lawful imon
ey In which they are to be paid, and we
denounchethe present and precciing
administrations for surrendering this
option to the holders of government oh
libations I
7. We demand the graduat 'd income
tax. to the end that ag'zregated wealth
shall bear its jut pro!ilrtion of taxation. I
and we dell iunce thie hdecision of the I
supreme court, in relation to the income ;

constilution and an invasion of the
rightful powers of congress (a'er the
subject of taxation. t
8. We demanid that postal savings
banks be establishelt by the government
for the safe deposit of the people andl
to facilitate exchange.,
TRANS'PORTATION.
1. Transportation being the means of
exchange and a publie necessity the gov
ernment should own and operate the
railways in the interest of the people
and on a nonpartisan basis, to the end
that all may be aceorded the same treat
ment in traimsp(lrtation. an. that tih
tyranny and political pwver now exer

policy.
2. The interet of the Unitsd State's
in the public htigiWays buiilt with publi-i.

or sold. but guarded an protectetd for
the welfare as provided by the laws or
ganizing such railways. The foreclos
ure of the existing liens of the United
States on these rouats .houilhl at once fol
low default in the payment of the debt
of the companies and at the foreelosure t
sales of said roads thi g'ivernllment shall
purchase the same if it Is-comes nb.eos~sa- I
ry to protect its interests therein or if t
they can be lurehasedi at a reasonableli
price; and the government 'hall operate 1
said railways as pulblic highways for
the benefit of the whole anti not in the
interest of the few. under suitahle pro
vislous for the protection of life and
property. glving to all transtx)rtation
mterests and privileges equal rates for
fares and freight.
E8. We denounce the present infamous
schemes for refunding these debts and
demand that the laws now applicable
thereto be executed aniaadnministerei
1according to their true intent and spin4.
4. The telegraph, like the post-office
system, being a necessity for the trans
mission of newi, should be owned and
operated by the governmeat in the izj
* ere-.t of Itme people.
