A DECEMBER EVENING.
I looked up into the sky one clear
night, and contemplated the wonder
ful beauty of the star-gemmed
heavens —the “work of God’s fin
gers. ’ ’
And as I gazed upward I was thrill
ed with the silent grandeur and im
pressiveness of the night. I heard,
in fancy, the “music of the spheres,”
and, in spirit, walked the “Milky
Way” as the stars “declared the
glory of God” —these same stars that
have been bewildering and inspiring
all the ages since creation’s dawn
with their beauty and their mystery
—these same stars that shone upon
our primitive forefathers as they
roamed the forests in the dim cen
turies of the past.
And I thought, 0 man! surely
thou art very small! Thou art but a
shadow, a passing dream, a flower
that blooms and fades between the
dawn and sunset, a bubble on the
stream, seen one moment, the next
forgotten. The stars, in their eter
nal sublimity, laugh at your fitful
coming and going, your petty striv
ings, your empty successes.
And then a bright star that shone
above me leaned down from the sky,
and whispered to my enraptured
spirit, “We are God’s handiwork—
the work of His fingers, but man is
the crowning glory of His workman
ship, the masterpiece of His creation,
the one into whose being He put a
part of Himself and gave everlasting
life, the one He gave His Son to re
deem. We shall pass away, but man
shall live forever.”

DR. ANNA N. SHAW TELLS WHY
SHE IS A SUFFRAGIST.
“Why are you a suffragette?”
I expected that she would launch
into a political lecture, but she did
nothing of the sort. She went back
to the beginning of the development
of her ideas, and the following* half
hour was one of the most interesting
I have ever experienced.
“When my mother was eighty
years old,” she began, “I went to
her room one day and found her in
tears. My mother was a strong, fine,
wonderful woman. I asked her what
was making her unhappy, and for
some time she insisted it was nothing.
But finally she said:
“ ‘I have worked all my life, and I
have worked hard. But I have noth
ing. I haven’t even enough; money
to pay my funeral expenses.’
“ ‘But,’ I assured her, ‘father
gives you everything in the world
that you want, doesn’t he? Your
children do everything in the world
for you?’
“‘Yes,’ she replied; ‘that is just
it. I don’t want, gifts of charity. I
want what I have earned. Theoreti
cally I am well off; in practical fact
lam a pauper. When I die some one
will have to bury me.’
“I was aghast at the thought,” Dr.
Shaw continued, “but I knew she
spoke the truth. My father and moth-
Under The Vine and Tig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
er had gone to Michigan among the
pioneers of the West. Together they
had cleared away the wilderness and
established their home on their farm.
My father was a splendid man, but he
was a dreamer. My mother was the
balance wheel, the great force. It
was she who directed wisely, who
kept the family together. All the
weight and care and responsibility of
raising a family, of making the farm
pay, of investing wisely—hers was
the great directing influence. She
even toiled out in the fields, as did
all those women who came out here
when the country was new. Yet, in
the face of those hard years, she had
nothing. My father owned every
thing. He could will away all but
her third. In case of her death she
had nothing to will—absolutely noth
ing. Where was right or justice in
that ?
I Drink To A Dream
I drink to a dream tonight—
A dream that comes from old remembered ways —
Now shadowed in the stillness, blurred from sight,
A hidden path in Life’s lost Yesterdays—
The scent of roses on the twilight air—
Soft moonlight fluttering in a silver stream —
Red lips that quiver with Love’s silent prayer—
I drink now to a dream.
The shadows lift about me, and the room
So lonesome but a fleeting space ago
Has given way to orchard lanes of bloom,
White with the blossomed drift of April’s snow,
Or lit with flame where crimson petals burn
Like living fire upon the dream-clear sight
Back where I meant, God willing, to return
To lips that said Good-Night.
Gray year on year has vanished now, where I
Have reached the path I knew so long ago—
Life’s dreary shadows no more cloud the sky,
Blown from the Dark where soft winds whisper low
The music of a voice that crowns the Night
With ripple clear and sweet as singing stream,
Deep to the dregs—across the lost way’s light,
I drink now to a dream.
—The Issue.
“I put SIOO in the bank in her
name and told her that, anyway, she
could pay her burial expenses. She
smiled very gratefully and said: ‘Yes,
but it isn’t really mine. I did not
get it because I had worked and earn
ed it. It was given to me.’ So, after
all, I wasn’t able to get around the
matter.
“When the war came my father
went aw r ay to fight for his country.
To a man country is greater than
family. He risked his life, of course,
but the glory and enthusiasm, the in
spiration and the result all made his
task easier than ours —those of us
who stayed at home and kept the
farm going. My mother and I plow
ed in the fields. It was a dreadful
struggle. Only the women who lived
through the horror of the Civil war
can understand how frightful were
the conditions and how unbearable
the hardships. At the end of the
four years my father came back. The
farm was his; we had nothing to
show for what we had done.

“When I .became a young woman
I wanted to go to college. I felt that
I must learn. I had a great desire
to help the poor and degraded. When
I said that I would earn an educa
tion for myself I was laughed at.
Why should a woman want an edu
cation? Had my brother hinted that
he had a wish for a college education
the whole family would have lived
on bread and water to save the money
necessary for his expenses.
“I was obliged to break with my
family, to go away, to suffer all sorts
of humiliation to fulfill my ambi
tions. I got a degree in theology,
and went out into the slums of New
York. But I found that the poor and
the degraded did not need religion.
So I went back again to my studies
and secured a degree in medicine. In
that way I got near to those whom I
wanted to help and benefit. With
each year I discovered new forms of
slavery. I found fresh horrors. I
worked among women, and it seemed
as if they were always getting the
worst of it. Every effort I made to
better conditions, I became more and
more convinced that the efforts of a
few charitably inclined individuals
were almost useless. Only by legis
lation can conditions be changed.”
“Let me tell you about an incident
that occurred at Albany,” said Mrs.
Stevrart. “The question of woman’s
suffrage was under consideration. A
society woman was giving her opin
ions. ‘We women don’t want to
vote,’ said she. ‘Political matters are
not for women. We are willing to
leave polities to the men, and we
want them to leave us to our chari
ties. ’ . v T .
“At that, Mary Kelly, the presi
dent of the Capmakers’ Union, arose.
“ ‘We don’t want your charity,’
she declared in a firm, strong voice.
‘We want justice. We want to be
paid for what we do. We want tq
have a voice in the rules and regula
tions that govern us. We know bet
ter what is for our good than do these
men in legislative halls. Justice —
not charity!’ ”
Mary Kelly, it seems, is one wo
man who can knock the nail on the
head. —•Louisville Herald.
HOW TO MAKE MISCHIEF.
Keep your eyes on your neighbors.
Take care of them. Do not let them
stir without watching. They may do
something wrong if you do. To be
sure you never knew them to do any
thing bad, but it may be on your ac
count they have not. Perhaps if it
had not been for your kind care they
might have disgraced themselves a
long time ago. Therefore do not re
lax any effort to keep them where
they ought to be. Never mind your
own business —that will take care of
itself. There is a man passing along
—he is looking over the fence —be
suspicious of him; perhaps he con
templates stealing, some of these
dark nights; there is no knowing
what queer fancies he may have got
in his head.
If you find any symptoms of any
one passing out of the path of duty,
tell every one else what you see, and
be particular and see a great many.
It is a good way to circulate such
things; it may not benefit yourself
or any one else particularly. Do keep
something going—silence is a dread
ful thing; though it is said there was
silence in heaven for the space of
half an hour, do not let such a thing
occur on earth; it would be too much
for this mundane sphere.
If, after all your watchful care,
you cannot see that they have done
any thing bad, throw out this hint
that they are no better than they
should be —that you should not won
der if the people found out what they
were after a while, then they may
not carry their heads so high. Keep
it going, and some one may take the
hint and begin and help it along after
a while —then there will be music,
and everything will work like a
charm.
Follow the above directions and
you will be pretty sure to make
plenty of mischief. —Georgia Free
Lance.
THE DEAD.
Two loves my life has comforted,
Both loved me well, I know;
Their fragrance is an incense fire,
Os sweet and tender glow;
Yet both are dead, and vanished,
Alas, long years ago.
And both are dead and vanished,
Both passed in tears away;
One sleeps within his narrow grave
Where tangled wild vines stray-;
And one I pass upon the street,
In silence, every day.
—W. A. Dromgoole, in Nashville Ban
ner.
