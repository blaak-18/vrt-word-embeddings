CORN NOT DAMAGED.
President Hill Nays Ihe Crop of North
west Is in Uood Condition.
New York. July 1 7.-President James
J. 11ll of the Great Northern railway
before leaving for St. Paul discussed
the reports of crop damage in the west.
IIe said:
"Unquestionably some damage has
been done to the corn crop by reason of
the drouth, but, like everything, has
been exaggerated. The damage west of
a line drawn from St. Louis to Omaha,
and much of this can be repaired by
good rains. It should be rememberedl,
too, that as an offset there has been a
wondorful wheat harvlst, particnlarly
in Kansas. The matter hardly resolves
itself into a railroad one, for the reason
that the railroad have, and the indica
tions are, will have plenty to do even
should it develop that the corn crop is
short. However, as I have said, there
is ample time yet for much of the da
mage to be overcome. "
On the same subject President Lowry
of the Minneapolin. St. Paul and ealte
Ste Marie telegraphs from the west as
follows:
"Up to the preAnt time prospects for
crops were never better. I make this
statement from a pmisonal inspection of
a few days ago in Minnesota and North
and South Dakota 'and from daily re
ports received from all the points along
the line of our road, also from talking
with various grain men in Minneapolis
who are thoroughly posted on the sub
ject."

New York, July 17.--It is not un.
likely that the cruiser Buffalo will pave
through Hell Gate tomorrow when she
leaves for Newport. Captain Hutchins
commanding the vessel, has given it a
his opinion that the paesage is not par.
ticularly dangerous. Officers at the
navy yard say that the order issued af.
ter the Massaschusett went throughi
Hell gate to the effeet that no battle
ships were to be taken through without
permission does not apply to orniusers.
The offmcer seem to think Captain
Hutobins will take the short course
through the Gate.

SHORTAGE 1SI ..,l( ,
One of the Firm Admits Usima kintd,
of (Other People and by npeal.
latilon to Win Enough to
Pay Their Ind.hbtedness.
Rt. Louis, July 17.-`-nsational ad,
Ini~ihui hav beenll imalte on the stand
by Sammie ,% (aylord, mlnior mlenmbe
of the firm )f (;avlord, Blesiing & Co.,
stock brokers, which failed recently.
.na'l'ird audnitted at a hearing before
nllnk ruiptey lIeferote Coles that the firm
had Ibeen practically insolvent for two
years and had been doing business on
other people's money, on funds secured
from hin -al cnutomers. Deals wherein no
i'sttk ,ver c(hanged hands being more a
matter of tbookkeeping in which the
firm never forgets to charge up commis
sions, margins and interest were admit
ted by Gaylord, who also told of the
emphloymnt of relatives' names and the
ue of an insane man's name in the so
Couiltis.
At the time of the failure they were
short $150,000 in bonds, faoe value, and
5000 shares of stocks in New York.
It was admitted by the witness the
failure was due to their own specula
tion by which they hoped to win and
pay off their indebtedness, estimated
to be something near $200,000. As to
the missing oollateral, left with the
firm's customers, attached to promisory
notes, Gaylord admitted all had been
hypothecated with banks as seourity for
loans to the firm. There was no ap
parent desire to oonoeal anything con
cerning the involved transacotions of the
firm on Gaylord's part, and the revela
tions he made were more astonishing,
to the creditors assembled, becatse of
the confidence and trust for many
* !J* pacosed in Gaylord.
