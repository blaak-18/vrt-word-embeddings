Want a "Democratic" Conven
lion.
The goldbug Democrats are Lu
rsy all over the country dlenouncing a
the Chicago convention as Popu
listic, Socialistic, etc., and calling
for a new convention which is to
be Democratic according to their
notions of Democracy.
Even our own Picayune rather
urges such a course in a "cry-mbay" a
editorial of the 15th inst. t
Speaking of the Chicago conven- tl
tion, it says : b
The acts of the convention showed p
in every way that it was a radical tl
and revolutionary Lbody, given up n
to Populistic and socialistic doc
trines, and crowning its radical o0
acts by nominating as a candidate
for President of the United States I
a man who has been elected to of- a
fice by Populists, and who has tl
been more identified with them than
with Democracy.
We are right glad to have the
People's party recruited with such
a fine Ibt of men as the Chicago
convention all. at once. We al
ways confidently believed in the
ultimate success of our party and
principles, but we must confess, al
that to have the great national et
Democratic party in convention as- s
sembled dump 2-thirds of that con- at
vention, its best speakers and wri- hi
ters and its party machinery into w
the People's party, is so refreshing- tr
ly sudden. that it is an agreeable ki
surprise. , u
We coukd have gottenalong very th
well without the party machinery, in
however, and it begins to look as la
if the.gold bugs will help to rid us I(
of that incubus, for the Picayune is

The only remedy seems to be in re
the nomination of a genuine DLmo- tb

Brabster West's Letter.
)Once upon a time there lived a
man who becl e po l) ]ssessed Ioif a
goose which laid golden ecrS which
.was a very nice thing for the man.
I Because of the wealth-producing
quality of the _oowe, he did not
kill and roat her, but very miag
naiut ously allowed her to eat the
scrans from his table in order that
she might lay more eggs of gold.
One day, however, he conceivedt
the foolish idea that if he killed
the goose and opened her, he would
become immensely wealthy at one
stroke, and without waiting for her
to lay one egg at a time. lie car
ried his idea into execution, dis
sected her and found what
Paddy shot at.
Similarly with the class of mo
nopolists wLo have li (,d and wax
ed fat upon the toil of the e-ople.
Every year they took fro:n the
prtslucers all the fruits of th'ir la
lxbor, but-not satislie I with that
they tried to thdouble their indebt
edness and wretchedness at one
stroke by destroying one-half of
the money of the country. The
producers haal certainly been as
silly' as geese for many years, and
hiad permitted themselves to be
rohutl, hut when thie robber.s es
sayed their destruction, they sought
to escape. Their first opportunity
was the National )emocratic Con
vention, anti therein they adopted
a platform N hich virtually declares
that they shall he ro! bed no longer.
Upon that platform they iinoimira
ted William Jennmigs Bryan. who
is neither Democrat nor Populist,
but one of thle people.
I have no right in thls corres
londence to express gry idea of
what the People's party, in its con
ventien next week, should do. It
is for the wise men of that party to
decide whether or not they will in
dorse or nominate Pryan, or name
another candidate. I may say,
however, that every Populist whom
I have seen since the Chicago con
vention thiniks that the People's
party should nominate Bryan, for
they believe that he can be elected.
As Senator Stewart said to me:
"The Amnerican pI ope ep ill elect
the manir who said, 'we shall anmswer
their demands tor a gold standard I
by saying to t hem, ou1 shall not
press dtown upon the brow ot labor
this crown of titorrs. You shall
riot crucity mankind upon a cross
of gold.'"
The Rlothschild-Morgan-Cleve
land Sherman-MeKinley combine
are a ftoumlned by the wave of en
thusiasm i which has swept the
country since the nomination of I
Bryan. They see clearly that only (
by the use of money can they pos
sibly prevent his election. Their
cheapest pilan is to use money to
secure the nomination of another
reibrm candidate at St. Louis, and
I have positive proof that they have
already commenced wo.k to that
end. Dr. C. W. McCune, whose
sell-outs of the Southern Mercury
and the Nation'al Economist are
history, is going to St. Louis- tor
what ? For the good ot lis coun
try or the benefit of McCune, who
knows f The Populists of the Dis
t"iet of Columbia have instructed
their delegates to work for the nora
ination of Bryan and Sewall, the
latter of whom it transpires was g
nominated at Chicago because he d
is an original greenbacker.
If the goldbugs caammt divide the h
reform forces, it is darkly hinted in
the clubs of Washingtron that the h
reformers will receive a (lisagreea
ble buUpribe. I heard of this and

- Resolvced, That the Populistr of
ed this District (4ti) he urPed t, or
es ganize a People's lparty cltb at
,I. each polling lace in their respect
ice wards and parishes, whiere such
Sa club is rt already organized.
Io That said clhlns report at once,

of precinct, ward and parish in which
said club is loca:ted, to the La.
n- Populist, Natchitochets, La., which

to tory of same and furnish a copy to
ito each club.
Be That said clubs also report in
same way t to their chairman nd
secretary of their reslamcetive par
n shs, and that said chairman and
t- secretary report their addresses to
sl aid La. Populist, so that said di
or rectory when printed will be a
Scomplete gcuide of the Populist or
ganization in this district.
That each Popylist pa:per in th,.
ct district be requested to piullish
er these resolutions and urge the l'op
Sulists to carry thuem out.
ot Remember what a power the
tr Farmers' Alliance was in this State
Sea few year s ago. It was not as
s ustrong in numbers as is thoe Peo
ple's party, but it was better or
e ganized.
be The plan outhned in the alxove
- resolutions is the same which was
re so successful in organizing the Al
1 liance, It will be equally success
Sful in our party if we will follow
B- it out.
ir When we get these directories
:o printed and a copy in the hands of
'r each officer In each precinct club
Sin the district, then any man can
e take one of these and get at once
into communication with every
e Populist in the district.
Then people can move on masse
and as a unit, and their poHwer will
be inconceivable.
