WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wilt Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good ;wiorwf'u"
hiitti"' folly as -it tlieb; ild showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly ! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
iug the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illnstrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-clas in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.
