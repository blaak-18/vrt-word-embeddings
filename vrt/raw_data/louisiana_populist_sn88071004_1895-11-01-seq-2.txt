Mr. J. S. Dixon, editor of the w;

that he will make as good a record D(

Receiver, has made a most efficient,

The Democratie ~'ate Central to
committee met at New Orleans on

their henchmen had absolute con- e,

They dictated such plans for tl

Our neighlbor, the Enterprise,
in last iweek's issue sljen(ds all of
its availabile space for e- itorials, in
helping Senator lainchird out of
his "D)ouglass Infamy."
= The Enterprise and Senator Blan
" chard seem to think it "infamous"
r. that the North ('arolina legislature
shouldl adjourn 3i minutes after
00 its regular hour of adjournment,
out of respect to thec memuory of
Fred Douglass, but they do not
tell their readers and hearers that
this is the samune ouglass whom
H: President Clevelahnd invited, re
D ceived and dined with at his State
(dinners at the White IIousewhile
ia Democratic President of the
United States.
They do not tell us that he is the
r same man, negro or a"lisceenla
< tionist," if you please whom Pre.i
ldent Cleveland retained in oflice
until he (Douglass) should "''find it
oe convenient to send in his resigna
tion, which convenience did not
arise until Frederick had been in
office under Grover I. for over two
years.
The Enterprise and Mr. Blanch
ar(l say: "That the Populists
joined the Republicans of North
Carolina on the 18th dlay of Jan
uary last and voted down a reso
lution to adjourn on the 19th in
honor of Robt. E. Lee."
"That on the 20th of February
last, they again joined the Repub
licans and voted down a similar
resolution in honor of George
Washington, the father of his coun
try."
To show up the hypocrisy and
misrepresentation that Democrats
are compelled to resort to in order
to save their weakening party, we
will republish an extract from the
official journal of the North Caro
lina House of Representatives,
r which extract appeared in this pa
per on March 15th last, and is as
follows :
TE RESOLUTION.
"Whereas. the Democratic press have
willfully and maliciously charged and
published that the General Assembly of
1895 refused to adjourn out of respect
to the memory of the birth-days of
Washington and Lee, but did adjourn
3 out of respect to the memory of Fred
I Douglass, and
"Wherereas, by such false statements
they reflected upon the dignity and pur
pose of the present House, and
,"Whereas, the facts in the case are
as follows :
"That on the 18th day of January.
1895, Mr. French offered the following I
resolution :
"Resolved, by the House of Repre
sentatives, the Senate concurring, That
when this House adjourns, it adjourn
to meet Monday at 8 P. M."
Mr. French moved to suspend the
ruies, which was done, and the resolu
tion was adopted without a dissenting I
vote, and sent to the Senate for concur
rence, which resolution the journal
shows was adopted. This resolution t
being non-concurred-in by the Senate,
the House met next morning at the
musual hour, and after being in session )
less than half an hour, on motion of c
Mr. Young, of Wake, the House ad- c
journed out of respect to, the memory
of Bobert E. Lee, the same being his
birthday.
On the list of February a reolution C
to adjourn from Thursday until Satur
day, out of respect to the memory of I
George Washington was offered by Mr.
Williams, of Craven, and was passed
by a very large majority; the same was
non-concurred-in by the Senate. The P
Bose met the next day as usual. A I
motion was made by Mr. Luask to ad- a
journ out of respect to the memory of
George Washington, the same being his ]
birthday, and the ame was unanimous
ly adopted; and
T3 DOUGLAss MaITtE.
Whereas, on the 1ist day of February
a resoluation was offered by Crews, of
Ganville, that the Bose adjourn at 12
o'aloek, out of respect to Fred Dou ,
glass, when his sudden death had just
been announced. The Boose did not u
adjoura as this hour, but when the plr- g
pus of the motion was explaed to d
dmply give pubilty to the sudden and
measpeeted death of this distinguashed
dmesed, it was eerrud in by all p
parties, •a r as matter fact, the fi
Borse did not adjourn until 7 minutes '

e- 41suN1ces'ted that a imiotion mi.i.ht lbe
te made that when the hoii-e dlid ad
Sjourn it couil ie a mark of res
pect. A standinu g vote on a mo
lie tion to this etleect was taken and
carried. No special attention wa,
ie given to the matter, an min the rush
of business, it seenms lhat there was 1
San impression that the speaker's
ruling would do away with any t
Ce significance of the reso(lution. The
it strongest illustration of this state
a mient is the fact that a number of
ot Democrats voted for the resolution.
and11 have since it pIassed, said they
1 voted for it.
ro Ihro is an opinion from the Vir- t
ginia Sun published at Richmond, I

ts It is the opinion of leading ,men
th of the General A:sembly that the t
n- construction being put upon the
n- matter by some papers is unwor
thy of decent and truthful jour- t
nalism.-Virginia: Sun.
So we see that the Ilou"e, which s
was largely Populist and Repuldi- I
can, did pass the resolutions and I
did adjourn in honor of Iboth Wa\'sh- ]
e ington and Lee, and it was the I
Senate, which we believe is Demo- I
cratic, that refused to concur in the s
d resolutions in honor of Washington
and Lee. a
If this record is any honor to r
1 the Denmocrats and any disgrace to r
the Populists we fail to see it. i
Remembc r that the above extract d
from the North Carolina house is I
a resolution that was adopted in Il
that Hlouse by a vote of 53 against a
27, while the document printed in c
the Enterprise in support of Blan- h
i chard's side of the question is not a
f official, but simply a statement n
et which was voted down in the said
of House, and then signed by Demo- a
crats for campaign purposes. p

r- Editor Town Talk: p
In your edition of Oct. 19th, I s
" notice the appointment of myself p
by the I)emocratic Executive Com
Smitlee of Ralides parish, as one p
of the commissioners of election y
e- for Cheneyville ward, on Monday, i1
Dt Dec. It;th, 1`t95. Thanking the ii
U above mentioned committee for si
1 the compliment, I respectfully de- ti
dcline serving the people or party tl
g in that capacity.
r- Bolieving myself to be a Jeffer- fi
t sonian Democrat in all and every- f
Sthing that the term can possibly tl
e imply, and having for twenty-five a
Syears closely watched the actions ci
f of what is known as the Demo- t
-cratic party, I have come to the tl
Sonclussion that it is either not the
party of Jefferson and Jackson,
Sor, American history is not to be
. believed wherein it relates to their
f political character and doctrines.
Believing also that the Peoples'
Party is fully in line and accord
Swith the principles of the two Im
Smortals I have concluded to pre- B
serve my Democracy by casting dl
I my vote and influence, if any, with
I the party of The People.

sults of the primaries.
SThis will soon he recognized,
and the trading will begin. It
Imay start ,it once, as an inllnice
ment to the negro to participate
in such primaries. and as an evi
dence of that fact, we refer the
T.-D. and our readers to the two
letters in this issue from ward 1o
of this parish recounting the pro
ceedings of a Republican meeting
held there last Saturday under the
auspices of that delectable rem
nant of carpet-baoism, Monk Wells.
How is this for a white suprem
acy party? How does this com
pare with the honest proposition
of the Populists to submit all can
didates and platforms to white
primaries, to the end that white
supremacy should he legally,
peacefully and honorably secured.?
You Democrats, white men of
pure blood, who have devoted
your money, your life work, and I
in many cases, risked your lives t
in battle, for the principle of white
supremacy, how (1o you regard
this betrayal of your interesta by,3
the Democratic party ? I
You did not make your sacri- I
fices for office, nor did you get of
fice, but the men who have filled o
the offices drawn, thile fat salaries,
while they made your labor sell
cheap, until they begin to think
thnt the olffices belong to them,
these men are dragging the negro
back into politics to dominate you
because they can no longer hood
wink and control you.
These same men condemned the
Republican party and hunted its
white leaders down like does be
cause it used the negro vote
when honestly cast for that party.
But now when the white people are
demanding some reform for their
patient party service, and refuse
to support the Democrat party
unless they get it, these leaders a
and office-holders propose to fill g
their places with negroes, and force
the Democratic party to follow in
the footsteps of the Republican
party in this State.
Will Caucasians submit? We d
think not. o
Two gentlemen stood in the a
capitol gazing upon a portrait of
Washington, when one exclaimed
that the face was a little too ruddy.
"Ah," said the other, '"tho color
you disapprove is the blush of shame

people now in office.-- Silver ri

S'he triumph of the Fo-~t er c, mn
Iine in the state centra; l c,'ntll ttce
:t New OCrleans on Thurs l:ay ha=
not dissipated the oplosit ion which
was rallying around the McEhnerv
standard. Tile imeetint was :a -clit
and dried affair, and Foster had his
lines well drawn. In their delilter
ations they simply voiced the wish
es of Foster and Fitzpatrick-a
combination which has been form
ed three years, and( cemented hv
tlthe "cohesive power of public
plunder.'
But the people of Louisiana are
not going to suhmit to the dictation
of any crowd of political hock
sters. The News is not prepared
to say by what means thisI power
will be overcome, but the Foster
following, now arrogantly juhi
lant, may rest assured that they
have a fight on their hands. The
opposition will be organized in
every parish, and at the proper
time a man in whom all true lovers
of Louisiana can trust, will I'o
found to lead the now rapidly
forming lines of the opposition to
victory.
The present situation is this : A
I large majority of the people of
this state are opposed to the politi
cal methods of Gov. Foster. here
tofore this opposition has been un
organized, while the Foster com
bination is made up of a close cor
poration of astute politicians who
are in it for the spoils. So long as
the people are passive the politi
cian wins. When they get thor
oughly roused the politician hunts
his hole.
The people of Louisiana are get
ting aroused. - Monroe Evening

Editor Populist :
As the Democrats and Republi- (
cans have consolidated in ward 10,
and claim they have the money or
machine to do us up, we call on
you for the necessary weapons
with which to fight, and we will
try to stand them off. They claim
that tihey have killed us already at
a meeting held to-day at Marco's
gin, at a Republican mass-meeting,
the speakers being Monk Wells, r
and two negroes, in which the
Democrats took an active part.
We would like for you to come
down again soon, and give us an
other lecture. If you can, lot us L
know through the paper when you x
can come, if you can come at all.
Yours respectfully,
