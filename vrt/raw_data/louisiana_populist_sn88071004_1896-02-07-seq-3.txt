Theacn and Now.
SOn the 14th 'Sptembet, 174,
,t the good citizens of New Orleans
organiz d and elected a leader to t1
. overthrow a city government reek- e
. ing with oppression and corrup- 1i
Y tion, and when the authorities in
power saw it, they put the Metro
politan police in readiness to sup- ti
press the organization, and assign- o
ed Gen. Longstreet to take com- f
I mand, and when he arrived in hear
ing of the yells of that band of a
Patriots under the leadership of r
the gallant Fred Ogden, he turned r
, his horse and rode back to the a
e Custom House, and when asked it -
he intended to take command of e
-the Metropolitan police force, he
] answered, "No, I have heard that i1
yell too often in Virginia, to at
8 tempt to overpower it with a Met
e ropolitan police force."
In 1896, the Democratic leaders a
a in Louisiana find themselves in u
r Longatreets situation, as they see
that the Patriotic and Liberty lov
- ing sons of Louisiana are rallying s
+ to the standard of Capt. J. N. a
Pharr, of St. Mary, and on the c
21st of April next, will wipe from 
existence the Foster-Fitzpatric
- combine, backed by the unscrupu
lous legal talent of Louisiana, a
more corrupt government than that I
d of 1874. They will do it, peaces
' bly if they can, forcibly if they
A must.
s The sugar planters met at Hotel j
Royal, in New Orleans, Monday
January 27th, and indorsed the
2 Populist ticket with Capt. J.N.
I- Pharr at its mast-head. The meet
i ing wa one of the largest and 1
most enthusiastic that was ever
held by that faction of the Repub- r
lican party. The regular Republi- t
cans will hold their convention on
the 29th, and will no doubt do the
r. same. When we get all factions t
,, opposed to the present adminis
tration headed by Murphy J. Fos
ter and his corrupt political ma
chinery, united in a common fight
r- to defeat it, we will no doubt win.
If the old time Republicans in
dorme the present ticket it will be
be an invincible one, and one that
L neither man nor devil can count
out.--People's Call.
The Populist party is irat in
i siae in three States, and second in
twenty-two. It increased 240 per
i cmt. in the lat three years. It
has over three thousand newsp
pers to ight its battles. Ita ast

State Platform
People's Party ct Louisiana.
1. We affirm our allegiance to
3 the pure principles of popular zov
- ernment, as enunciated by Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson, and
emibodied in our National platform,
and we uphold the principle em
bodied in the immortal declaration
that this should be "a Government
of the people, by the people and
for the people."
2 And especially do we de
mand the free and unlimited coin
f are of both gold and silver, at the
f ratio of 16 to 1, with equal debt
J paying power as primary money,
e and a full legal tender monetary
t system for the people of the Unit
ed States, without consulting any
foreign nation or money syndicate.
L 3. We demand for Louisiana we
t industries equal protection to that
Safforded the industries of other
States. An American, not a Brit- L
ish system of commercial laws,
that no discrimination against our
a agricultural and industrial classes =
n may be made.
e 4. We favor a just and liberal
system of public schools for the
benefit of all classes of our people,
P and we deplore the fact that for
many years the management of
a our public school system has been
so defective that the party now in A
power seeks to disfranchise a large
c number of our citizens on the
grounds of ignorance.
a 5. We denounce the disgrace
t ful and infamous election frauds R
which have prevailed in Louisiana,
and we demand and are determin
Y ed to have a perfectly honest and
fair election, at which each citizen
qualified to vote, shall cast his bal
I lot freely and secretly, and the
V vote shall be fairly counted as they
are actually cast. This is the su
preme issue in this campaign, and
- m its sncees the honor, manhood
I and prosperity of Louisiana are TI
r involved. The foul and loathsome
methods which have brought the
ballot box stuffer to the front, and
placed him in power in Louisiana,
e dust, in the name of liberty jus- Is
a tie, morality and common deen- n
- cy, be suppressed.
6. We oppose and denounce the 81
proposed siffrageamendment, con- I
t eocted by political schemers, not to
Spurf and elevate the ballot box
but to subserve their selfish pur- la
e poses by providing contradictory N
t slidcaties, to suddenly disfran
it le mlar asses of worthy citi
ea, by deluding the people with a9
romiea of ch"es n the next
ure. We denounce the
whole amedmeat as a vicious i
a fraud which proposes measures and
a methods that are un-American and bi
destructive of free institutions. "
t. We favor the utmost eoono
my arf e ditres, in State, cty
and p s, and pledge our candi
dates to a striot adimprtialen- b
iforcemeat of all laws, and the pree- sa
ervation sad promotion of every
interest in Louisiana, whose wel
fare is bxoader and more sacred a
0 than part] lines or partisan poli
