Taft has brought some
consternation in their ranks by his
open insistence upon free iron ore,
coal, petroleum, hides and lumber, as
well as demand for an excise tax of
1 per cent, on the net earnings of cor
porations. The standpatters, how
ever, are not so much disturbed as it
might be imagined. The protected
interests have done amazingly well
under the Dingley rates. Therefore,
should Taft veto the Payne-Aldrich
bill, the interests w'ould be pretty
well pleased to be as well off as they
were before; while the Senate has
sufficiently raised the schedules to
allow for a considerable hammering
down and still not get much below
the Dingley duties. The whole thing

a daughter of mine nor any woman,
young or old, to teach in Chinese
missions in the United States. Men
should do this work.

ship Nantichoke was sup
posed to be proceeding to Vene
zuela in pursuance of a deep, dark,
filibuster plot, and now it is rumored
that the former President (and by
all right the present President) of
that interesting country is at the bot
tom of the revolution which is now
spreading over its neighbor, Colom
bia, —that he is actually financing it!
To furnish the sinews of war in such
a fashion looks like a staggering
proposition, but perhaps in South
America a revolution may cost no
more than one of our Fourth of July
celebrations. And it would certainly
be a splendid coup if he did manage,
through the Colombian skirmishes to
regain his control of Venezuela, even
if the Colombian president, who is
now charged with having fled, should
meet with the same exile Castro did.
But the rumor is probably only
Washington gossip. Recently, how
ever, from Santanda, Spain, Gen. Cas
tro made the following statement re
garding South American affairs:
“The diplomatic arrangements
made by the Venezuelan Government
with the United States, France and
other nations are onerous and hu
miliating to Venezuelans.
“The sovereignty and independ
ence of Venezuela is weakened by the
treaty with the United States, which
now is in a position to take possession
of the Venezuelan republic in the
name of the Monroe doctrine.”
This shows him to be anything but
a “has-been” mentally. Every coun
try with any’ class about it has its
“peril,” so why not Venezuela its
“American peril?” And serve to get
Castro recalled by his country to cope

This decision grows out of
