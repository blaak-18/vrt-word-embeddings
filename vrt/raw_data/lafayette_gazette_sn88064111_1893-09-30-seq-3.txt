TOWN AND COUNTRY.
The Police Jury meets next Mon
day.
Court-house Keeper Hirsh has given the
court-house and yards a thorough cleaning
preparatory to the meeting of court next
Monday
Judge Debaillon's new law office
is a beauty, of which the judge may
justly feel ' joud, and furnishes ad
ditional evidence of the taste and
skill of the contractor, Mr. Fred
Mouton.
Mr. Felix Salles leaves to-morrow
for New Orleans on a purchasing
tour. It' his intention to buy a
large amount of assorted goods, in
cluding a varied assortement of
ladies dress goods.
Go to Bagarry for a good shave and hair
cult. I-t
Bibi Savoy and Joseph Austin,
were jailed Thursday charged with
assault and battery on the person of
Adam Scott, after having been badly
shot by Albert Chargois. The
fracas happened in the neighborhood
of Carencro last Saturday, and all
the parties are negroes.
Mr. Nollive advertises in another
part of the paper a fine farm for
sale. It can be bought at a great
bargain. Tife place is situated only
three miles from town, and the land
is of the greatest fertility.
That popular merchant Mr. Leon
Plonsky calls the attention of the
general public in this issue of The
Gazette to his fresh and well assorted
stock of goods. Mr. Plonsky says
he is ready to give some very low
figures on purchases.
The organization of a Chatau
quan circle in town, besides the
means of instruction it would afford,
would bring the young people to- a
gether and the sociability thus
created could but be a source of
much pleasure.
To show the fertility of the soil I
in this town, it is only necessary to (
mention the fact that a man this ,
week, with a sickle had cut from a r
ditch on Lincoln avenue, quite a lot t
of grass that will make fine hay. t
Mr. H. A. Eastin has painted a i
very neat sign for The Gazette. Mr.
Eastin's taste with the brush is well t
known here, and we know that when c
we gave him the order we would
not be dissappointed with the result,
and we are not. To those who may
need any kind of painting we cheer
fully recommend this gentleman as
one that will give satisfaction.
Ladies and children haircutting at domi
cile. L. P. Bagarry
Some two weeks since we were in
formed that it was proposed to put
a play into active rehearsal, with a
view of presenting it to the public
at a latei day, the money realized
to go towards a fund for the high
school. We trust the matter will f
not be allowed to languish.
Our young District attorney M.
T. Gordy, deserves much credit for
the way in which he "cleared" up
things in our parish this term of
court. He did his duty, the Jury g
did theirs, and the Judge did his
Consequently we had a "clean
sweep. "- Verm/ilion Star.
If you have anything to sell, and
wish to bring the fact before the c
public, you will find no better
medium than the advertising I
columns of The Gazette. The r
paper is adding names to its sub- l
scription lists every week, and we o
can truthfuly say that it covers the c
,parish pretty thoroughly. o
The Rayne Hook & Ladder Com- a
pany will give a ball at their Opera 1
House on Saturday, October 7 next, I
and the succeeding evening a con- c
cert. Preparations for both enter-C
tainments are such as to insure aP
most pleasant time to those whoc
may attend. The Gazette returns ti
thanks for an invitation. ti
The bakers of this city are in- o
dulging in a cut rate war, and, in t
consequence, bread is selling for
the time being at 60 ounces for ten o
cents. One of the bakers told Thetl
Gazette that there was a largely in
creasing-demand for bread, judging
by the number of loaves he bakes. J
At the rate bread is selling few fam- g
ilies care -to go to the trouble of s
cooking rice, potatoes or grits. n
Rofert Bailey will open an oyster saloon ii
to-day in the room adjoining A. M. Martin's t]
saloon, opposite the court-house where he
will always keep fresh oysters which will be
served either raw or cooked. Robert has a
perfected arrangements which he is enabled F
to furnish fresh fish to the people of Lafa- C
yette every Friday. Those who desire to a
Ibuy fish will please give him the order I
during the week. Robert is a deserving
young gentleman and it is sincelely hoped
that he will receive his share of public pa
The switch engine while attaching a cab
oose to a freight train, a few days since, ran
off completely. All hands jumped off, and
no one was hurt. The boys say Jake easily
takes the cake as a jumper.
Superintendent Owen was in Lafayette
Thursday, and gave out the information that
he would soon put in service two sugar cane
trains between this point and Morgan City.
The pay car has failed as yet to material
ize, and that happy smile that usually comes
over the faces of the railroad boys about the
e 2oth of each month has, likewise failed to
g materialize.
t Mr. John Vigneaux has been having some
alterations and repairs made to his livery
stable building. As now enlarged the build
: ing, we think, shows to much better advan
r tage.
A dance will take place in the High
School building tonight, and whatever profit
may be realized will be turned over to the
school fund. We are, also, informed that
the Alexandria string band will furnish the
music.
The Gazette said last issue that the negro
fugitive, George Morton, arrested and jailed
last week, claimed to be a member of the
Order of Railway Trainmen. As the infer
SISce may be deduced by the unitiated that
colored men are eligible to membership we
have been requested to publish the fact that
the laws of the order forbids the admission
of colored men.
Dr. F. J. Mayer, assistant inspec
lor of the upper Quarantine Station,
left last week for Chicago to visit
the W. rld's Fair.-Times-Demo
crat.
The Gazette deeply regrets to be
called upon to chronicle the death
of Mrs. Mary Iurt, nee Rocinski,
who departed this life on the 21st
instant, three miles west of Scott,
leaving a baby six days old. Mrs.
Burt was a native of Germany.
Gaston Labbe and John Taylor,
two young men from Broussard, ap
peared before the Mayor, last Tues
day, to answer to the charge of
*"disturbing the peace and careless
driving," plead guilty and were fined
$8.50 each. The Gazette had heard
different versions of the affair, some
stating that the young men were not
as culpable as many would infer,
but as they voluntarily admitted the
charge, nothing more can be said.
Two industrious Italians, Antonio
Tomazi, and Antonio Grossi, sent
The Gazette two magnificent sugar
canes, grown by them on Mr. Z.
Doucet's place. The one from I
Tomazi weigh 5~ pounds and I
measured, 8 feet; the one from
Grossi weighed 7 pounds and meas
ured 8 feet. With such splendid
results who can doubt for a moment
that our lands are splendidly adapted
to the cultivation of the sugar cane.
And it is such evidence as this
placed before our eyes every day,
that shows us the great need of a
central refinery.
Base Ball.
A game of base ball was played
on the grounds here last Sunday be
tween the Stonewall, of Ile Pilette,
and Favorites, of this town, which
resulted in a victory for the latter
club. Some very fair playing was
developed during the game, and
Jim Marsh easily carried off the
honors. Appended is the score :

An Important Capture.
It looks like Sheriff Broussard has
effected an important capture in the
person of the negro giving the name
of Geo. D. Morton, but believed to
be Jeff Gibbs. If he is the right
man, he was a member of the noto
rious gang of Copiah (Miss.) rob
bers, and is the only one at liberty
of the gang that operated in the vi
cinity except one. Three or four
of them have been legally hanged
and several sent to the penitent iary
The description sent by Sheriff
Broussard was deemed sufficiently
clear to warrant Sheriff Matheny of
Copiah, in applying for requisition
papers which Sheriff Broussard re
ceived Thursday. In the same let
ter the information was conveyed
that C. J. Allen will be here to-day
or to-morrow to take the prisoner 1
to Mississippi. There is a stand- i
ing reward of $833 for the capture 4
of Jeff Gibbs, and indications are ,
that Sheriff Broussard will receive it. <
A Birthday Party.
At the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
J. C. Couvillon, a nice party was
given in honor of the 2xst anniver
sary of their son, Leon's birth. The
magnolia String Band, of Carencro,
in attendance. The following gen
tlemen were present: Messrs. F. A.
Broussard, John Craney, Armand
and Arthur Guilbeau, Pierre and
Paulin Lacour, Olivier and Oscar
Couvillon of Carencro, Henri and
and Pierre Gerac, of Lafayette.
-he ladies were the Misses landry,
Mrs. A. F. Guilbeau, and others.
Several charming musical selec
tions were rendered. A splendid
feast was spread in the open air,
and the beautiful rays of a full moon
r falling upon the shining service and
the dazzling chin vare, dreating
t scintilations of gorgeous and bril
lant hue. The tables fairly groaned
under roast turkeys, pigs and other
viands, and liquids of finest brands.

and the thickly settled country ad
joining our little village, Royvile
should, within the next few years,
develop to be the principal town of
the parish, and so situated that
our nearest competitor is ten miles.
The business annually done here
would do credit to many towns much
larger, both in population and area.
Our only drawback and inconve
nience, is a line of trans
portation. A road of railway from
either Cade, New Iberia, or Lafa
yette (latter place preferred) would
willingly be accepted by our
people, conditionally, that taxation
be omitted. Some time past, when
rumbrs were circulated that the
Souithern Pacific Railroad Com
pany intended extending a branch
from Cade station to this place,
that is, if the farmers granted the
right of way. This proposal met
with universal satisfaction and your
correspondent was reliably informed
that such proposition would be ac
cepted by our farmers and granted
any day. . Why not many another
attempt? If we were successful in
securing a branch road and depot
at Royville, then au revoir forever
our booming Carencro's pros
pects for the court-house. We are
fully aware of the fact that our sister
town is up to the times, and Brother
Totidem Verbis is always correct in
his high and deserving praise of his
town, but we also awake. and no
longer remain dormant! You ad
mit this, brother, don't you?
