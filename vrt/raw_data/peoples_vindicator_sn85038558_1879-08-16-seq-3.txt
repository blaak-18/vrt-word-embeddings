Mr. Joba Gill, whose acquaintance is
so large and popular throughout this sec
tion as to render any special mention
thereof on our part superfluous, has
taken up his usual summer and fall ree.
idence in the Red river section, from
Coushatta to Alexandria. He repre
I ents the popular firm of ;regg &. Ford
of Shrevep'.rt, who are the largest gro
cers in that city. The trade of this see
tion with that frm through Mr. Gill has
been entirely satisfactory for the past
year, and we are glad to know that our
people will have the opportunity of con
tinned business relations with them. Mr.
( ill's hea!'quarters in this city are at
Fontenot's Hotel where persons desirous
of purchasing anything in the grocery
line can call or address him. Mr. Gill
will also visit at regular intervals all the
towns and stores within the scope of his
trade and we assure him a warm welcome
and a big trade.
Last Tuesday Mr. Newman and Mr*
r Hall, of Coryell Co. Texas, were in our
city, obtaining evidence as to the identi
ty of Neet flail who was run down and
killed in this parish, by deputy sheriff
Hewitt and posse, from DeSoto parish,
on the 8th of June last for horse stealing
in Texas, an account of which was pub.
lished on the 14th. Hall. it will be re
membered, resisted arrest and was killed,
while P. B. Hicks, his companion, sur
rendered and has sines confessed his
crime and is now serving out a term of
five years in the Texas penitentiary.
The gentlemen alluded to (one of whom
is the uncle of Neet Hall) had a picture
of the young man, which was fully iden.
tiled by citizens here as the likeness of
the one killed. They also exhumed the
body and identified it by some pecntiarly
. plugged teeth. It seems these gentlemen
were on Hall's bond for $2000, for his
appearance at court in Coryell county,
nnlder the charge of horse stealing, and
wished to fully establish his death in
order toprevent the bond being forfeited.
Neet Hall must have been an incorriga
ble horse thief. His mother is a widow.
of good family, and is deeply distressed
at the untimely fate of her son.
Weather Notes.
We have been enjoying a season of
rain and windstorms since our last.
The nights and days have been surprise
ingly cool for Angust. Covering to
sleepers is now decidedly comfortable.
in some sections strong winds have ac
companied the heavy rains, while for
several days the hot sunshine was shut
off by heavy sluggish clouds.
Crop Notes.
Caterpillars are reported from all see
tions of our parish, and much apprehen
sion prevails that they will destroy
the crop of cotton, which generally
speaking, is a good one. Paris Green and
tin sprinklers are going like hot cakes,
and the worms must look for war. Corn
is all it will be, and we hear that though
short enough will he made to do tas, pro.
vided we economize.

Entrie of laud have not been as brisk
as we would wish, when we know that a
large body of fine lands are open to en
try in this district. However, we sup
pose the strinugecyof the times has ef
fected land entries as well as all other
interests.
Some interesting statistics are had
from the commissioner of the general
land office showing the volume and di
rection of homestead pre-emptions. The
amount of public land entered for
settlement under the homestead act in
the year ending June 30, 1879, was some
thing over 600,000 acres, an srea larger
than that of New Hampshire. The ave
rags number of acres taken by each
homestead settler is 120. On this basis
the number of families erecting their roof
tree on the public domain was some 50,
000 The whole number of homestead
entries from the time the homestead law
went into operatien to June 30, 1878, a
period of siteen years, was 34,84. Al
lowing 120 acres to each settler, the
whole amount of land thus occupied
would be 46,181,760 acres. This im
mense domain would make fifteen States
as large as Connecticut. It is larger by
nearly three milion aeres than all New
England, and it exceeds the combined
areas of Maessachusetts, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Connectient and New
York by an area about equal to that of
Delaware. In the number of home
stead entries Kansas takes the lead with
41,034, Minnesota stands next with 51,
575, and Nebraska third with 47,962. In
the rate of increase from 1877 to 1878
Dakota took the lead. The number of
homestead entries in that Territory in
1877 was 1154, and in 1878 It was 4128.
In the States of Kansas, Minnesota and
Nebraska and the Territory of Dakota
the homeste ,d entries in 1877 amounted
to910,397 acres, and in 1878 to2,892,
683 acres, an increase of over 300 per
cent. In 1872 the total area covered by
entries under the homestead law amount.
ed to 4,600,000 acres. In 1873 the en
tries fell off to 3,793.000 acres : in 1875
to 2.356,000 acres, and in 1877 to 2,168.
000 acres. In the year ended December
31, 1A78, the entries were about 6,000,000
acres. The increase is a cheerful and
healthful sign.

Our merchants notwithstanding the
dullness of their business are not dis
pirited but look hopefully forward to a
bright future of trade -provided the
"caterpillars don't eat up the cotton."
Stocks are ample for summer demand
and prices are as low as customers could
desire. The receipts of new Louisiana
cotton in New Orleans one day last week
was four bales, brought by the Thomp
son Dean and Yazoo. One bale was rpised
by Mr. J. T. Watson in Tensas parish,
and was consigned toT. L. Airey & Co.
It was classed Low Middling and was
sold for lie per pound. Another was
from Stamps's Landing, and was con
signed to Payne, Kennedy & Co. The
Yazoo brought the tirst new cotton from
St. Landry parish. One bale was raised
by 8. J. C. Gordon, on the Atehafalaya
river, and shipped to Levi & Newman;
the other was shipped by C. B. Ardrus,
of Opelousas, to J. W. Burbridge & Co.
Where is our friend Charlie Pierson from
"old Natchitochee f" Ha generally ships
the "first bale" from our parish.
The total visible supply of cotton on
the second instant was 1,974,845 bales
against 1,848,720 at the same time last
year. These figures indicate a decrerse
in the cotton in sight. on the second in
stant of 73,835 bales as compared with
the same date of 1878, a deereams of 744,
038 bales as compared with the corres
ponding date of 1877, and a decrease of
873,450 bales as compared with 1876.
We extract the following interesting
statistics:
According to Poor's Manual, just pub.
lished, Lbe total miles of raild in the
United States on December 31, 1878, was
81.841, of which 9694 miles were opened
during the last year. The gross earning.
of 78.960 miles of road were $490,103,361
-an increase of $17,194,089 as compared
with the previous year. It .is the rast
increase since the panic of 1873, and it
marks the beginning of the new era of
prnlnc'ive industry upon which we have
entered. This increase was due entirely
to the gain in freight earnings, there be
ing a slight decrease in passenger earn
ings. The average gros earnings per
mile of all the railroads in the United
States in 1878 were $6210, and of net
earning~s 1276; while the dividents paid
were equal to 2..4 per cent of the total
capital, stock. No dividends were paid
on any roads in West Virginia, Soutb
Carolina, Mississippi, Kansas, Colorado,
Arkansas, Texas, California or Oregon.
The largest amount of dividends on the
roads of any one State were in New York,
aggregating $,9581,436, and the smallest
in Missonrl-$10,000
The reduced tax on tobacco has been

the advocates of the ehange find their
theories and predictions already confirm

on the first of May, and the returns for
May and Juane show a total revenue of

months of 1878 under the old figure.
The great bulk of this increase occurred
in May, and is attributable to the faet
that the agitation of the subject has

weeks before; but the revenue for June,

they have attended rehearsals, and left
the band room with their clothing satu
rated with perspiration, and the briny
moisture exhuding from every pore in
their bodies. Weekly they give out
door concerts, which most certainly have
some attraction for our citizens, judgin
from the numbers of fair ladies as well
as gentlemen who congregate around the
Band every Thursday evening. Besides
their constant labor to perfect themselves
in iving_ forth muelc's enchanting

members are monthly subjected to a
heavy expense to attain perfection.

agement, insufficient evidence of inter.
est to compensate for the constant la
bor of expense which the members are
undergoing. They owe a balance for
their instruments, as well as other in.
debtedness. The citizens of other towns
in North Louisiana have subscribed lib.
orally towards such organizations, why
cannot our citizees do the same I Let
some energetic, bard laborer in a tood
caune take bold of this subject and ap
peal stirringly for help to aid our "boys."
If A. will not do it then we knew there
are fair ladies, who are never backward
in such lobors of love.
Natchitoehes is well known for its
liberality towards all patriotic and noble
purposes. It was evinced unmistakably
when the U. 8. government endeavored
to place the brand of infamy on our
citizens for daring to assert their rights
as citizens; it has been evinced on
numerous other occasions. Let it not
be said then thbst our citizeas will not
exhibit a spirit worthy of their past
record, when it comes to eeonraging an
enterprise whieh is local in its echaracter,
and organized for the pleasure and
musement anad gratification ofall classes.
Let the effort and call be made, and our
word for it our citizens will et fail to
respond. Make the trial.
