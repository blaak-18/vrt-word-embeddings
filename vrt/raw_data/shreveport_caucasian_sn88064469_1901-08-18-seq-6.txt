ITS CI 0 ` 1NING LO1Y
THE ELECTRIC DISPLAY AT THE PAN
AMERICAN EXPOSITION.
Exceptional Opportunitle For the
American lantitute of Electrical
Engineer. W.ho Meet In Buffalo.
Many Foreign Experts to Be There.
ISpecial Correepondenre.]
BUFFALO, AU-. 12.-In the develop
ment and utilization of that mystic and
potential force known as electricity the
Pan-American exposition is far and
away beyond anything before attempt
ed in the way of a public exhibition of
man's achievements in the realm of
applied science. This is demonstrated
in the nightly illumination which is the
crowning glory of the exposition.
Standing upon the triumphal bridge or
causeway as the darkness closes and
looking upon the scene the effect is
thrilling. The outlines of the buildings
traced in countless rows of electric
lights, the softening colors and brilliant
play of glass and gilding and the retlec
tion of this fairyland in the surround
ing waters, the Jewehle spray of cas
cade and fountain, the almost spiritual
beauty of the various pieces and groups
of statuary and the stately grandeur of
the great electric tower form a picture
that cannot be adequately portrayed in
words. It is without doubt the most
lavish as well as the most artistic and
systematic display of electric lighting
that the world has ever seen. This is
made possible because of the enormous
power utilized at Niagara, where there
is more energy concentrated than could
be furnished by all the coal mined In
the world in a day.
Not alone In the illumination is elec
tricity an Important factor in the expo
aition. In the electricity building there
is Installed an exhibit of electric ma
chinery and appliances more complete
and varied than has ever before been
shown under one roof. Perhaps one
reason that has nfluenced exhibitors
in making the best possible showing
was the Iknowledge that the American
lastitute of Electrical Engineers would
me. ber and that there would thus
be afforded an exceptional opportunity
for calling the attention of experts to
the merits of their goods. The meeting
oecurs next week, beginning on Tues-.
day, and will be attended by a large
number of electrical engineers and ex
perts not only from all parts of this
country, but from various European
countries.
At the closing session of the Paris
slectrical cogress of 1900 the Amerl
msa Institute of Electrical Engineers,
through one of its delegates, extended
a berty invitation to all the delegates
jprusez, as well as to all electrical
ng bodies in general, to visit
Amerit In 1901. The Pan-American
epoeloion.was suggested as an occa
.ion ofering unusual opportunities to
European engineers and scientists for
ouch a visit
The foreign electricians have accept
ed this cordial tnvltation of their Amer
ican brothers in considerable numbers.
Before coming to Buffalo they will be I
given a formal welcome and reception 1
s New York. This will occur on
W4dnesday of this week. On the fol- 1
lowlag days technical visits will be
made to important works and Installa- i

I IMPLY RECIPES.
A Refreshing Salad and Some Tempt
ing Vegetable Arrangemeints.
I'otatoes to Serve With F'ish.-Pass
hot muaslhed potatoes through a ricer.
Add a generous piece of butter, a little
salt and hot :iilik or cream, as needed.
Heat thoroughly and press firmly in:o
a buttered tin. have the potato about
half an inich thick. Cut into diamond
shaped pieces and score diagonally
with a skewer dipped in melted butter.
CUCUMI.ER SALAD.
Brush over with the yolk of an egg
beaten with a tablespoonful of milk
and brown in the oven. Serve with a
teaspoonful of pens, in a thick cream
sauce. in the center of each piece.
Cicumber Snlad.--With a handy sli
cer remove the outside rind from the
cucumbers cut in thin slices and let
stand in ice water to chill. Wipe dry
and arrange the slices in the salad bowl
In the form of a Greek cross. Make a
French dressing in the proportion of
three tablespoonfuls of cider vinegar
to six tablespoonfuls of oil, half a tea
spoonful of salt and a dash of paprika.
Rub the inside of the salad bowl with
the cut side of an onion before the sal
ad is disposed in it.
Now that tomatbes are coming in
plentifully we can use them for pan
ning, broiling and stuffing. To pan
them cut flrm'ones in half, flour well
and put cut side downward in a pan
In which one tablespoonful of butter
has been heated. Season, cover and
cook slowly until they are tender all
through and browned on the cut side.
Transfer to a hot platter, brown side
up; stir Into the butter In the pan one
tablespoonful of flour; mix and add one
cupful of milk., stirring until smoothly
thickened. Pour this gravy around the
hot tomatoes.
If for broiling, cut the tomatoes into
thiok slices, dry well, season and dip
each slice into melted butter, then into
ine bread crumbs and broil at once
over a clear fire.
All sorts of mixtures may be used for
stuffing tomatoes-chopped meats, boll
ed rice, bread crumbs. The two requi
sites are a high seasoning and moist
ness, the latter result being attained by
adding one or more spoonfuls of melted
butter to the mixture. A sharp oven'
will bake mnd brown them in about
half an hour.
Eggplant is a good breakfast substl
tute for meat. It is cut Into slices, egg
ed and crumbed and fried in smoking
lat fat This gives a less greasy dl~b
ban when it is sauted in a pan. This
regetabe may also he stuffed, first par-.
rling it whole, then halving, cutting.
mt the center from each halt, chopping
his and mixing with an equal amount
rf crumbs, a high seansoning of salt,
cpper, onion juice, a fe.w spoonfuls of
nelted butter, chopped parsley and, it
Iked, chopped ham. The shells are
:hea to be flled and baked.-Table,
Falk,
Angel and Amether White Cake.
Dainty and delightful is angel cake.
Properly made, it is fit for angels; bad
ly made It would give a goat Indiges
ion. The whites of 11 eggs are put
Into a large soup plate with 1% cups of
-eofeetioner's sugar and beaten until
tiff. Care must be taken that none of
bhe yolks are allowed to color the mli
re. One cup of flour is then add&Le.
with a teaspoonful of vanilla seece.
Lastly, a teaapoonful of cream of tar
tar is beaten In with the mixture. The
_ake is put into a square tin, which has
sot been greased or buttered and baked
for 40 minates.
Anether white cake, rather less troo
blesome, is made with halt a cup of
fresh butter beaten to a cream, one
rap of granulated sugar added gradu
illy and beaten well and two euap of
wur into which have beae sifted two
teaspoefulis of baking poder. The
b-tenu whites of four eggs and half a
-up of milk are added lau the cake
baked for 30 mlnutes in apbhllow tie.
Lememade and eed Tea.
L.monade as it is usually made Is too
weak and is not allowed to stand long
enough on the ice. Made with plenty
ef lemons and nearly as many oranges
with carbonic water and some fru t it
I lncomparable.
Iced tea is a gratefur dinner 1ink
nad should be poured warm front tLh
pot upon the Ice in the glass that it is
to be served in. The lemon and ygar
can be added at the discretion of the
IndividuaL Coffee frappe is deligatful
In summer when it is very cold and
served with whipped cream.
T.e Tre.a Rest.
The trunk rest is a device to save the
back of tbe trunk owner, and a great
boon it is to travelers and sojourners
In resorts at the mountains or by the
shore. It supports the trunk at a con
-enaent height to spare one's back
bwhe peeking or unpacking and to
live eeasy access when the trunk is In
daily use; also It makes it possible to
sweep under the 1rank.

San Francisco, Au. 16.--Arch rock,
use of the greatest obstructions to safe
mavigation in San Francisco bay, has
been destroyed, over 30 tons' of nitro*
glycerin being employed to remove the
the rook which lay about midway be
tween Alcatraz island and Lime Point.
The rock was several acres in extent and
all but its summit was under water.
The explosion was qt off by electricity
and so great was the concussion that
rock and debris were scattered over a
great area and a column of water and
stone 1000 feet in height arose from the
bay. The force of the explosion was
terrific and could be felt all over the
city. Large quantities of fish were de
stroyed.
