What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOUTHERN
ENTERPRISES.
Under this heading the American
Times-Record reprints an excerpt
from a recent Herald editorial on
Georgia Cornbread:
Northern firms put up breakfast
foods made out of oats and other
inferior substances, and these are
consumed in large quantities be
cause they are persistently adver
tised. Why not do the same in re
gard to Southern water - ground
meal? It would open up a new
source of wealth to the South, and
prevent corners in wheat and keep
the price of bread made out of flour
within proper bounds.
Why should not this be done?
The market is full of all manner of
goods put up attractively for the use
of consumers. These goods all re
quire raw material for their manu
facture, and plants in which to man
ufacture them. Read the labels on
these packages and it will appear
that nearly all of them are put up in
the North.
Such business builds up communi
ties. The raw material is always as
near the factory as possible. The
process of manufacture requires
skilled labor. It furnishes employ
ment at good wages for working
people. It largely increases the com
mercial value of the product manu
factured. Such enterprises make
communities prosperous.
One reason why the North is more
prosperous than the South, is be
cause our Northern brethren have
been more alert to take advantage
of such opportunities. They have
shown more enterprise, and they
have reaped the benefit. But why
should this state of affairs be al
lowed to continue? Why should the
market be supplied with pickles put
up in Pittsburg, or a coffee substi
tute made out of wheat in Michigan,
or with tomatoes canned in Dela
ware? There are a thousand and
one articles that could be put up for
market in the South as well, and
often times better, than in the North.
It is time our people were displaying
equal enterprise, and reaping equal
benefits for themselves while greatly
benefiting Southern communities.
There is indeed a change in this
respect. Hogless lard may be cited
as an instance, which means a steady
stream of wealth for the South in sup
plying a want that has been created
for the finished product of wary ma
terial that formerly was of very lit
tle commercial value. Fruit and veg
etable canning plants are being put
up in the South, and in many ways
efforts have begun to be made in the
direction indicated;
It’s a good beginning. But it is
only a beginning, and a wide field is
open here for enterprise. The South
is rich in raw material, that awaits
this kind of enterprise to plant mines
of wealth all over this section.
Southern corn meal is but one of
them. Why should we longer neg
lect to make as much out of this as
is possible? Corn products are on
the market now. Grits are extensive
ly used, ground in the North of
Northern corn which is inferior to
Southern corn for such purposes.
Pop-corn in various forms is on the
market in convenient packages for
the retail trade, just as the products
of wheat, oats and other Northern
grains. In the perfectly matured
Southern corn raw material could be
found for a variety of such products
for the market.
What we need in our section is to
study the abundant raw materials we
produce, and to convert it into mar
ketable products for the general
trade.
CHICKEN STATISTICS.
The cackle of the American hens
is swelling into a mighty chorus. Ac
cording to the last census, there are
233,598,005 chickens of laying age
in the United States. These are
valued at $70,000,000, and the eggs
laid would, if divided, allow 203 eggs
annually to every person, man, wom
an and child —in the United States.
The value of all the fowls, $85,000,-
000, would entitle every person in
the country to $1.12 if they were
sold and the proceeds divided. All
of th'e animal products exported
the pork, beef, tallow, ham, bacon
and sausage—weigh 846,860 tons,
while the weight of the eggs laid
yearly tips the scales at 937,363 tons.
—The Better Way.
A CHEAP FILTER.
Take a six-inch flower pot, that is,
one that measures six inches across
the top, wash it well in strong soda
water, then put in a small piece of
new, fine sponge to cover the hole in
the bottom. Over this put three
inches of pulverized charcoal, then
two inches of white sand, washed
clean, pack down well, then fill the
flower pot nearly full of gravel. Fit
the flower pot closely into a glass
jar, or the mouth of a pitcher, or
other convenient vessel, so that noth
ing can get in around the edges.
Pour water into the flower pot and it
will come through into the pitcher
perfectly pure. As the vessel fills,
pour into bottles, stop closely and set
in the refrigerator, when it will be
come just cold enough to be palata
ble and wholesome, without becom
ing contaminated by having a piece
of dirty ice dropped into it.—Fruit
Grower.
(If you would keep clear of ty
phoid, and lessen the danger of ma
laria, make one of these cheap filters.
Both in city and country much of
the drinking water is contaminated
by seepage and other causes.
CRACKLING BREAD.
Sift one quart of Indian meal; to
this add one level tablespoonful of
salt and one pint of cracklings,
chipped fine (those made from the
leaf fat of hogs (preferred), put all
in a bowl and add enough boiling wa
ter to form a stiff dough; mold with
the hand and bake to a rich brown.—
Mrs. W. L. Griffith, in Farm and
Ranch.
Epsom salts placed in the drinking
water twice a week, where the fowls
can get no other drink, will avoid
that scourge of the poultry yard in
the South, “sore-head.”
BETTER NO NEWS AT ALL.
One had better know no news at
all than have to read the miserable
TSfye, 3effersouian
mass of foulness and trash with
which the sensational daily papers
are filled —the cold, spoiled scraps
from the reeking table of the daily
being then dished out secondhand for
farmer readers in the weekly, semi
weekly, and tri-weekly editions of
these dailies, the general mixture
usually being further seasoned with
disgusting advertisements of whiskey
houses and patent medicine quacks.
May God pity the home in which chil
dren are reared upon such intellec
tual diet.—Progressive Farmer.
The new-born colt must have milk
during the first half hour of its life,
or the chances are that it will die.
See that the colt is strong enough
to start the milk. If it is not, help it.
The first milk is necessary, as it
causes the bowels to move naturally.
If there is any serious constipation,
give a little castor oil, or give injec
tions of soap and warm -water.
Keep the mare quiet, and feed
carefully for a week or ten days,
when she may be turned in pasture—
but only for a short time at first.
If the mare does not have milk
enough, cow’s milk may be given to
help out, but it must be done with
common sense.
Very rich milk should not be used.
—Farm Journal.
Blind the hogs that have the habit
of eating chickens by hanging a strip
of tin, four inches by eight inches in
size, from their ears. This will stop
them when almost everything else
has failed.
CAN CAN.
Every grocer is a dealer in canned
goods. The shelves of every market,
grocery or country store are loaded
with canned goods. It seems that
there is no serious difficulty in sup
planting these goods brought from a
distance by the home product. It
should be easier even than reports
indicate.
The growers of fruits and vegeta
bles are the chief and best customers
of most local merchants. You buy
sugar, coffee, flour, and a thousand
other necessities or luxuries of these
dealers. When you have canned
goods to sell, buy only from the man
who will buy from you. That is busi
ness, and if put into practice will
make markets where none seemed to
exist before.
It should be borne in mind that
good canned goods are as staple as
sugar, tobacco, and handkerchiefs.
Good canned products can be put
up by any one who really cares to
try, and this class of goods is in
steady, regular growing demand at
remunerative prices.—Southern, Ru
ralist.
