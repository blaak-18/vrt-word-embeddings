HAVE been carrying a
frightful picture in my
mind for days—just such
a haunting, horrible thing
as imagination pictures of
a fact, and which we all
thank God we did not go
through the ordeal of ac
tually witnessing. It is
this, 0 mothers of tender little ones:
A wee child, hysterical with agony,
prostrate with blow after blow that
had been rained on its quivering baby
flesh, with the buckle end of the
strap of its baby carriage! That was
what a father came suddenly across
can you picture your feeling in his
case? It Would have been to take the
black fiend who, in the guise of nurse,
had amused her savage instincts by
torturing the innocent child and tear
her heart out with your own hands!
Oh, baby, baby! How monstrous
ly were you treated! What dark im
pressions will your mind retain —you
who were old enough to have told
your wrongs but who dared not be
cause you did not realize at all that
anyone could protect you from the
hideous black Thing which took you,
day after day, and worked her wick
ed will upon you. -You did not know
that you were a loved and a precious
thing. You did not know you were
the prize of any home. No, no. When
you groped a little into the conscious
ness of Life, the distorted features
of cruelty met you in the lonely
places and a mother’s brooding ten
derness was but a vague, dream-like
respite from the foul tyranny that
stung your flesh with blows and
stilled your piteous Avails from very
terror!
Ah, how we shudder to hear of such
a horror! Yet, have we the comfort
ing assurance that we may look up
from this page to meet the smile of
our own babe? Or do we give a start
led glance at the clock and think, un
easily, “I wonder why nurse stays
away so long!” Has it been an hour
—two hours —three hours —since you
saw the tiny one last, borne out for
his airing?
Oh, of course, our nurse is all right.
She can be trusted. She has taken
care of lots of children, etc., etc.
Pray heaven it is true. But —no
saunterer upon the highways, no
dweller by the parks and breathing
places but can recite tales of neglect,
if not positive cruelty, on the part of
nurse maids, that chill the very blood
Yet, remarkable to say, these very
persons who have taken the pains i”
particular instances to call the atten
tion of parents to what they saw
were grievous wrongs to the children,
have not met with any gratitude.
Why, if it were your child or mine,
dear Mrs. Blank, we could not be
grateful enough to anyone who would
call our attention to the slightest
lapse of the nurse from her duty to
our babies. But Mrs. Smith hears
with ill-concealed incredulity. The
story is discounted 9-10 before the
officious (?) visitor is through. And

eye at she juomejit, with no marks qr

bruises upon him. So how can she
think Dinah “meant any harm”?
Besides, nurses are so hard to got, you
know, and one is as bad as another,
you understand; and we can’t do ev
erything ourselves, as surely you real
ize; so, really, what are we to do?
Well, the matter is simple enough.
It amounts to little more than to
disabuse our minds of the memories
of the Mammies of the olden times,
and not think the young Susies and
Fannies are their prototypes. They
may be very demons. So keep the ba
bies under your own eyes, within at
least the hearing of your own ears.
Even the best hearted nurse may
through ignorance or carelessness
take your child into a district pesti
lent with Scarlet Fever or Diphthe
ria; or allow it to contract heavy
The Lost Song.
The maiden looked at the poet gray,
Then off to the hill-tops far away,
And she thought, “Had I the poet’s art,
I would write the song that fills my heart,
And such a rapturous .song ”twould be
That the air would ring w 7 ith its melody.
“Can life give more than youth and love,
A world of beauty, a Heaven above?
Oh, such a gladsome song I’d sing,
That birds -would pause on quivering wing;
The frisking lambs would cease their play
And breezes hush to hear my lay!”
The sad old eyes of the poet gray
Followed the maid, as she tripped away:
“Oh, youth, with thy happy dreams,” sighed he,
“Would that thou couldst return to me!
I can play ■with words, but what are they?
’Tis the heart must sing in the poet’s lay.”
And so, though the poet tried to lure
His silent Muse from her haunt secure,
And the maiden roamed ’mid leafy bowers,
While her heart sang on through the golden hours,
No song was giv’n the world that day
By the maiden fair or the poet gray.

The utter helplessness of a baby is
its dearest claim upon Ml the tender
ness of our natures. How grossly and
unjustifiably do we abuse the noble
responsibility of giving it the tender
est nurture, when we turn its delicate
body and its barely budding soul ov

A NOVEL DEFINITION OF A
LADY.
Once I heard a little girl define a
lady in away that seemed so clear,
complete and satisfactory that I im
mediately adopted it as my own, says
Helen Christine Bennett in a sympo
sium, “What Is a Lady?” in the
New Idea Woman’s Magazine for
October. She said: “A lady is a
clean woman who is kind.” That is
a very plain statement but it seems
to me that it covers the entire ground.
Clean she must certainly be, phy
sically, mentally and morally, or else
Jeffersonian
she can lay no claim to the title. This
is not so easy as it sounds. It is a
difficult task to keep clean physically,
even with all the modern assistants,
and it is far more difficult to free
oneself of the germs of moral and
mental dirt than it is to keep our
bodies free from the dust of the
street. Yet *a, lady must brush from
her all contamination keeping her
standards high and pure, living just
as nearly as she can to her ideal of
what is noblest and best, seeing only
that which uplifts and inspires.
And, in addition to this, she is
kind. She instinctively avoids any
thing that gives pain to others, and it
is this kindness that produces the
manner we call courteous. Kindness
is an active virtue, and so she will do
much for others, and in thus think-
ing of others she will eventually ac
complish that most difficult task—
self-effacement.
At first the definition sounds very
simple. We all are clean and kind
—at times. But to be always clean
and kind means living up to a pret
ty high standard; and even when one
has done one’s best to be clean and
kind always, there come moments
when one wonders if to the little
child who saw so clearly* one would
really be a lady.—Woodbury Geor

THE VALUE OF AN AFTER
NOON NAP.
Every one should take a rest in the
afternoon. The more lying down is
not resting; in fact, it is easier to
rest sitting than lying down, if one
does not understand how to rest
properly, and the woman who does
not relax when she lies down cailnot
rest, no matter how long she lies.
To relax properly, lie at full
length on the back with the head
level with the body, the arms ex
tended slightly from the body, and
the feet separated seme six inches.
The clothing should be loose, if lying
on a couch, but it is best to undress
and get into bed. Start with long
breaths of the kind known as 11 ab
dominal breathing,” followed by
upper chest breathing. ' *■'
Keep this up for a few minutes
only, and then, beginning with the
head, relax all the muscles the whole
length of the body—that is, release
the tension of them, so that, if the
feet or hands were lifted, they would
fall to the bed as if they were logs
of wood. It is not very difficult to
relax the muscles of the arms and
legs, but it takes patient practice to
relax the muscles of the back, thorax
and breast, yet by persistent effort
it can be accomplished.
When all these are relaxed the
person feels as if she were floating
in the air; there is no sense of weight.
Now an effort should be made to
relax the mind. This cannot be done,
as some have recommended, by
“thinking of nothing”—an impos
sibility— but it can be done by
directing the mind to the latest
pleasant thing that has occurred,
conning it over repeatedly, and it will
not require very many repetitions to
send one into a deep, baby-like
sleep—the kind that rests, and from
which one awakes, refreshing and
with every nerve tuned in unison
to the work ahead. Try it.
