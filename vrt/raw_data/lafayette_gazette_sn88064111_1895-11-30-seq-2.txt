Out of tihe Field.
To my Friends in the Parish of Lafayette: m
LAFAYETTE, Ia., Nov. 27, 1895. h
From this day I retire from the field as a S
candidate for the clerkship of the parish of th
Lafayette. I will remain with Isaac A. ec
Broussard as collector of taxes, .where I will 1y
try to give satisfaction as I have done in the L
past. o
I am still a Democrat and will support the ac
regular Democratic ticket to be nominated of
on the 14th of December by white prima. su
ries, of which I am a warm advocate. Give to
us a lift and we will land safe. is5
J. O. LEBLoANC.
Hon. Gilbert L. Dupre, of Ope
lousas, is mentioned as a probable
candidate for State Senator. Mr. .
Dupre is an able lawyer and an ex
cellent gentleman and should the
people of St. Landry and Acadia '
see fit to send him to the Legisla
ture they will have a worthy repre
sentative.
el
There is nothing compulsory about De
mocracy. If it doesn't accord with your
ideas you are at a perfect liberty to go else- to
where. But as long as you profess to bu a
Democrat it is your duty to recognize the s
duly constituted authority and expressed
will of the majority.-Abbevillc Meridional. ,
What does our esteemed contem
porary think of men who bolt a
Democratic meeting because of a sa
mere difference of opinion? Are
they entitled to be called Demo
crats ?
m
It seems to us that it is about time that le
the administration papers stop abusing
Johin Fitzpatrick. If he is a scoundrel it Ft
speaks in words of deepest colndemnation
against Gov. Foster for having hin as his
ally. In this respect The Baton Rouge Ad- ax
vocate, Lafayette Gazette and Bayou Sara to
True Democrat have been consistent, but
we can now recall no other who has ex- to
pressed an opinion on the noted Mayor of d
New Orleans and his mighty deeds.-Shreve
port Progress. at
The Gazette is neither praising T
nor abusing Mr. Fitzpatrick. If th
the people of New Orleans are sat- it
isicd with him as mayor, let them io
have him. We have no kick to th
make. The people of New Orleans w
are certainly intelligent enough to .fo
select their own officers. pa
Our able, but obstreperous contemporary, w
The Shreveport Progress, says that it has
"about come to the conclasion that there is
lttle independence left among the white su
Democrats of Louisiana." Why so Hlicks?
What have they done to merit such censure ?
Ii it that they refused to lend their assistance th
to a move whose success meant the disrup- J
tion of the Democratic party ?-Lafayette
Gazette. th
What have they done? Why fa
played the servile flatterer to politi- su
cal bosses and rendered scyophan- cs
tic homage to wire pullers and th
schemers who are actuated by no fo
o'her desire than to win regardless ye
otconsequences to the party. Of th
course, Mouton ! this is not true at sh
all, but w. are fast degenerating in- bc
to a class of lackies who have hi
neither the industry to strive for an h
ca
independent thought, nor the manli
mass to be anything but willing D
Aools.---Shreveport Progress. sh
TIHE BOLTERS AGAIN.
The gentlemen who bolted the
meeting of the Parish Executive
Committee last week and organized
the rump affair which we will call
the bolting committee through
courtesy-for correctly speaking
- they do not amount to bolters-have
caused to be published what pur
- ports to be the proceedings of the
I "Democratic Executive Committee"
n of this parish. In that remarkable
i document we find the following par
- agraph:
That the committee had met for the sole
purpose of selecting delegates to the State
Convention, and that nothing in the publish
m- ed call indicated such action; that inasmuch
of as Foster had no opposition it was unfair to
y hold the primaries for parish officers, on
i- the same day. and as early as is suggested.
There is no explanation of how
the paragraph got there; whether it
is a part of the resolutions or if it
c was a foot-note to the address on
the political situation in Maryland
and the sins of poor Senator Gor
man, we can not tay. We can't ac
count for its presence there. It seems
to have recklessly forced its
way in with a total dis
regard for the rights of po
sition and regardless of con
sequences. At any rate the ex
traordinary paragraph was printed
in the proceedings of the meeting of
the bolters or anti-Gormans. With
out going any further let us say that
we note with commendable pride
r the courage of the bolters, though
seriously questioning the soundness
of their judgment. They are not
satisfied with being "agin" the ad
ministrations of this parish and
State. They are dead against any
thing that dares show its head.
They are particularly bent on the
extermination of "bosses" and as
they do not find any of these un
fortunate people in this parish they
have jumped on Gorman of Mary
land and Brice of Ohio. Nothing
small about them; they are after
big game.
Mais, revenons a naos moutons. Let
us see if the committee had snet for
the "sole purpose of selecting dele
gates to the State Convention." The
following is the call pursuant to
which the committee met:
A Call.
ISLE PILETTE, NOV. I I, 1895.
To The Gazette:-The Democratic State
Central Executive Committee having fixed 1
the State Convention at Shreveport for Dec.
18, 1895, and the Democratic Judicial Com
mittee of this district which met at Abbeville
having called a convention at Lafayette for
Saturday, the 2rst day of December, r89;,
the members of the Democratic Parish Ex
ecutive Committee of this parish are urgent
ly requested to meet at the court-house in
Lafayette, La., on Thursday, Nov. 21, at 1 1
o'clock a. m. for the purpose of taking such
action as may be necessary for the selection
of delegates to said conventions, and to take
such other measures which may be deemed
to the interest of the democracy of this par
ish. J. O. BROUSSARD,
President pro tem.
Now, in all frankness, Messrs. '
Bolters, from Rumpville, can any
one who understands plain English
honestly interpret the above call to
mean that the committee was to e
meet for the sole purpose of selecting s
delegates to the State Convention?
Evidently, gentlemen, you do not i
know what you are talking about or t
else you are guilty of wilfully mis
representing facts in a futile attempt
to give to your bogus committee the
semblance of authority.
The esteemed bolters tell us that
"inasmuch as Foster had no oppo
sition, it was unfair to hold the c
primaries for parish officers, on the a
same day and as early as is sug- 5
gested." In the parish of Ouachta, the
home of Gov. McEnery, Congress- p
man Boatner and Judge Gunby, the f
leaders of the opposition to Gov. t
Foster, the parish Executive Com- P
mittee met on the 14th of November
and ordered one Democratic primary
to be held on the i4sA of December it
to selct delegates to the State, jiu
dicial and senatorial conventions 1x
and to nominate parish officers. b
There was nothing unfair about a
that. The minority in Ouachita,
if there existed a difference of opin- h
ion, did not bolt. In Caddo parish g
the committee did the same thing as
was done in Ouauhita, Bossier, La
.fourche, Jefferson and many other
parishes. In those parishes, there '
were no bolts. It remained for the I
bolters in Lafayette to discover that
such action was "unfair." xi
The Gazette is still of the opinion T
that the court-house bolt was con- is
cocted before the meeting. Despite C
their loud professions of Democratic ic
faith and their avowed intention to t
submit to the "action of the Demo- 6
csatic party," it is clearly evident t
that they never intended to go be- ol
fore the white Democrats of Lafa- Ic
yette. Their purpose was to split di
the party. They knew they had no
show. They know it now. By cc
bolting they have thrown oi the O
hideous mask under which they s
have been masquerading as advo- di
cates of Democratic harmony. re
Wait till the day after the ides of s
December, gentlemen; wait and you a
shall see ! im
PARTY FEAL TY.
he The gentlemen who have bolted
ie the Democratic party in' this parish
td should read the following from the
ill New Orleans States:
;lh "Men combine in political par
ag ties for the purpose of carrying out
re certain measures which they believe
Ir- to be essential to the welfare of the
he country; and, if they are sincere,
e" they will subordinate all minor is
le sues to the great, paramount ones
.r- that they have organized to advance.
Hence, when some dissatisfied spirit,
>Ie some weakling who assumes that
he all his little views and aims and
ch prejudices and likes and dislikes
t must be considered rather than the
d. greab ends of the majority, and
w threatens to wreck the party and
it convulse the world, if he be not
it conciliated, he is untrue to his
an party, and should be promptly in
id vited to acquiesce in the common
r- judgment or to walk out of the
camp.
is "In Louisiana, for instance, what
ts has party organization done for us?
s- It has rescued us from carpet-bag
2- ger and negro supremacy; relieved
a- us from a load of debt, State, paro
e- chial and municipal; it has rehabi
:d tated our waste places, and set us
)t far on the road to public prosperity.
1- Had it not been for strict party or
it ganization; had it not been that that
le organization was so strict that no
h man could kick out of the traces
is without incurring public odium and
it contempt, Louisiana would be to
I- day little more than a wretched ne
d gro province. No man who knows
anything about the history of this
I. State during the past twenty-five
e years will have the effrontery to
u deny this statement."
L Poor New Orleans! She is cer
y tainly to be pitied. It has been
shown beyond all doubt that the
g municipal administration is an
r aggregation of boodlers, some of
whom were tried and convicted; but
not one has yet been sent to the
r penitentiary. A great deal has been
said and much has been done in the
e way of exposing the corruption pre
3 valent in the city, blut the first
boodler is yet to enter the State
prison. It seems to be easy enough
e to convict them, but there appears
to be an insurmountable barrier be
tween a convicted alderman and the
penitentiary and unless there is a
change somewhere, the much in
dicted boodlers will continue to
serve the city as law-makers, and
the State will never receive their
services in a capacity, perhaps less
congenial to their tastes, but more
in accord with their reputation.
"English As She Is Taught."
K. 0. States.
A few years ago Mrs. Caroline B. Row, i
herself a teacher, collected answers to ex
amination questions in the public schools of
New York and published them in a little t
book. All the examples in it are genuine;
none of them have been tampered with or
doctored in any way. We append a few
specimens:
Amenable, anything that is mean. Am
monia, the food of the g.xls. Capillary, a
little caterpillar. Demagogue, a vessel con
taining beer and other liquids. (This an
swer was not so very far wrong). Epicac, a (
man who likes a good dinner. Eucharist, i
one who plays euchre. Mendacious, what
can be mended. Republican, a sinner men
tioned in the bible. Technology, something t
which teaches you to be very technical in t
your remarks. One sharp chap wrote, 2
S'This examination makes me feel nauceous." -
There are a great many donkeys in theologi
cal gardens. Gender is the distinguishing e
nouns without regard to sex. An intransa- 5
tive verb epxresses an act not done to an- t
other, as James did not strike John. To
find the number of square feet in a room you
multiply the room by the number of feet,
the product is the result. In Austria the
principal occupation is gathering Austrich c
feathe s.
What terrible travail the poor little crea
tures must have gone through on the sub
jects of history, biography, philosophy,
physiology, etc. Here are some samples:
The Indian wars were desecrating to the
country. The Indians pursued their warfare
by hiding in bushes and then scalping
them. Alfred the Great reigned 872
years. He was distinguished for let
ting some buckwheat cakes burn and the
lady scolded him. Joan of Arc lived in
New Orleans where she was discovered and
burned by the British. By the Salic laws no
woman or descendant of a woman could oc
cupy the throne. Socrates was no use in
fighting. HIe destroyed some statues and
had to drink shamrock. Socrates was a
great ridiculer. Hlolmes was a very profli
gate and amusing writer. Cotton Mather
was a writer who invented the cotton gin
and wrote histories. Ben Johnson survived
Shakespeare in some respects. Shakespeare
was a fiction and allegorlcal writer. His
father married a lady of means and they be
came greatly reserved in circumstances.
His most intimate friend was Ben Butler
who was also a great fiction writer. The so
loquies of -Iamlet throughout the play are
notorious. Tennyson is a very popular poet.
The most important event in the life of Hor
ace was his birth in 45. An inclined plane
is a plane that inclines. The body is mostly
composed of water and about one-half is
avaricious tissue. We have an upper and a
lower skin. The lower skin moves all the
time and the upper skin moves when we do.
The salivary glands are used to salivate the
body. Alcoholic beverages greatly obstruct
the breaking down of.the body. The weight
of the earth is found by comparing a mass
of known lead with that of a mass of unknown
lead. Venus, Jupiter and perhaps the
earth were known to ancients. Congress is
divided into civilized, half civili'.d and
savage.
But these eccentricities of genius are not
confined to New York boys and girls. In
one of the public schools of this city not
long since a pupil who was to construct a
sentence from nouns given wrote: "The
deep electricity rushed along the country
road." And another: 'The anspicious
statesman squealed for weal." We know of
a little girl upon being asked the definition
of ironical unhesitatingly answered: '-A
mhan with a glass eye."
