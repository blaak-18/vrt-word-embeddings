Hayes Democrats.
Shreveport Times.
Will those professed opponents to
Radicalism who think of voting for
Looney (we are gratified to know
there are very few such) bear in mind
that the party is to-day as corrupt
and as bitterly opposed to the South
as it ever was ? As Mr. Beck, of
Kentucky, justly remarks, President (
Hayes is now the only bulwark
against a repetition of tile outrages k
whlch have been perpetrated upon
this section. Conkling, Blahine, Ed
mands and tile other Radical leaders
would to-day re-enact these infamies -
if they were beacked by thie President.
These men will between now and the
next presidential election bend all
their energies to array a solid North
against a solid South. In further
ance of this scheme tile bloody shirt
will be taken from thie place where it
has for thie tiume bleen hidden away
and frantically waved over all tihe
North. Every effrt will be made to
provoke Southern menibers of con
gress into some act that can fateely
be constituted into an antagonism
against the North and its people.
ThIe late Gordon-Conklin difficulty
has already been seized upon and is
being worked up with villainous cun
uing.
That easauring Pole.
Thibodaux Sentinel.
Capt Enads as now obtained 22 feet
water into the Gulf and has demon
strated pretty surely that his plans
are correct. lie has effected more for
the commerce of New Orleans and
the whole Mississippi valley, than any
man has done in the last 25 years.
The Reformers Overlooked It.
Monroe Observer.
A tlonghtless correspondent of the
Columbia Herald very inaptly asks
why the legislature did not reduce its
own large salaries when it sought to
economize by making jurors serve for
nothing. The difference is this: the
members of the legislature are gen
tlenmen of leisure, and must have the
wherewith to support their position
in style-; while the juror, is for the
most part a clod-hopping laborer who
can make a living anyhow. You see
it would not Iave been sight to do it
any other way.
Sterling Talk.
TERaEBONXE PROGRESS :-Let the
Parish of Orleans dispose of her poll
tax as she thinks proper, let the coun
try parishes do likewise, and let them
be compelled to take caje of their
own destitute sick, but let the pay
ment of the poll tax be rigidly en
forced, and allow no man to approach
the ballot-box to seleet br us those
who shall manage oar affaihs, who
does not take interest enough in our
State, and in the edrnation of our
children, to pay one pitiful dollar in
its support.
The Republican situation in regard to
the New York Custom-House appoiut
ments reminds ne strongly, as the late
Mr. Lincoln would have said. of "'a little
storsy. A trading schooner was plough
ing along through the Sound when the
mate (and part puoprietor) thinking that
the craft was getting perilously close to
some steals, and ran aft and advised the
eaptain (and part proprietor) to put the
helm hard up. "Mr. Mate," said the
saptain, with much dignity, .'von go for
ward and attend to your end of the schoo
ner, and I'll attend to mine." The nmate
went forwrd and in about a minute
there wa h a p snd a rannig out of
eable and the mat ried heerily:-
,"Capo 81ocru, rye anchored my end of
the ashlooer? Mr. Hayes appears to
bhar anhored his end cf the schooner.
