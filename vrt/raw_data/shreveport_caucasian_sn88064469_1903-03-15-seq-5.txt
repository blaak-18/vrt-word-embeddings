IN THE HOME.
Order, Puanctuality and Beauty Oil
the WlheelN of Life.
Home should be an oratorio of the mem
ory, singing to all our after life melodies
and hurmonles if old z nmembered joy.
Henry Ward Beecher.
It cannot be denied that consciously
or unconiseousljy we absorb into our
natur the beauty or ugliness of the
outside objects with Which we daily
come in euttet. and that in procs of
time te is prei(soti seeks an out eL by
way of our features or words or ai
tions. ThI reutilt is scarCeiy surprising
if we give the question a tiooeint s
thought.
Order and punctuality are two great
rules to which every we\l, ordered
household must of necessity submit.
They are of inestimable Ltnefit in oil
I ing the wheels of life. preventing as
they do the worry incurred by loss of
time, which brings in its train wrinkles
to the brow and harsh words to the
lips, even if it be fortunate enough to
bring nothing else.
The arrangement of furniture, china,
books, etc.. should be regarded from an
ethical point of view as well as from
the artistic one. Like the golden sun
light, artistic, cheerful surroundings
stimulate the mind besides pleasing the
eye. For instance, a wall paper of soft
est yellow involuntarily sheds its com
forting glow on the mind, while one of
a deep gray or dingy brown hue de
presses the spectator. Human nature
craves light and warmth, though the
expression of its desire may be subject
to a variety of tints and degrees.
Crowded rooms seem to cramp minds
as well as limbs, and unmeaniugly som
ber aphrtments would fain draw over
your eyes that blue veil ever ready to
fall as the years silently advance.
The good order of a house is like con
tentment on a placid face, but fairy fin
gers are required to endue it with the
beauty of attractiveness. It is not given
to every one to realize the truth of
these two facts, judging from the many
homes In which one is struck by the
dust of neglect, the uncomfortable ar
rangements or inartistic colorings. As
we gaze we pity the inmates who are
so unmerciful to their own minds.
It should be remembered as an im
portant Item in the decoration of the
abode that 'cleanliness, purity and love,
embodied in the fragile forms of flow
ers, visibly waft a message from the
paradisaical home of our first parents.
The rooms are filled with beauty and
sweetness as they "pour out their souls
in odors." A woman in a well ap
pointed home has a much more attrac
tjve perspiqaitty than` a, woman who
takes no care of the province chosen
of all others to be the setting of the
jewel that may lose its own luster
through the dimness of its background.
It s not ii*essary to go to unjt itl
flaMe expense by procuring the soft
st, carpet;, ie richest hangings or
"priceless" pictures in- order to have a
bower of delight. - There must be,
however. po the other sid% an artistic
eye, a skillful hand, an 'observing

of the land are constructed to secure as
great an economy of labor as possible.
Indeed many of these appear to be
built on a plan to matke the work as
hard as possible. A writer in the Coun
try Gentleman thinks that a great
many of these inconveniently arranged
kitchens might with a little wise plan
ning be remodeled ii: a way to make
the housekeeper's work at least 50 per
cent easier, and that, too, at but slight
exoense. and he says:
A part of these coliveniences that are
figured are of a nature to be added to
the kitchen furnishings at any time.
Among these is the kitchen cabinet,
which on baking days at least ought to
save much running hither and thither
of tired feet. In this cabinet can be
placed every article that is used in
cooking, from the pots and kettles to
the ginger and soda. There are draw
ers enough to contain all the ingredi
ents used in cooking.
The lower closet is used for iron and
tin utensils. The upper closet, having
glass doors, contains kitchen crockery.
The upper drawer below the broad
shelf is for kitchen knives, spoons and
other small articles. The drawers be
low are for cloths, towels, etc. With
such a cabinet everything is at hand,
and no steps need be taken for dishes
or materials.
The second figure shows the kitchen
sink placed against the wall separating
the kitchen from the dining room. Up
on its right is a closet of the some
width, with doors opening to it from
both kitchen and dining room. When
the dishes are washed, they can be
placed upon the shelves almost with
out moving from one's position, and
when wanted for use upon the table
they are readily accessible from the
dining room also: The drawers for ta
ble linen shown in the lower part of

the closet pufl out either into the kitch
en or the dining room, as one may hap
pen to be.
The Ironing table that is figured,
speaks for Itself. It will be found to
make ironing about as easy as it is pow
uible for such an operation to be. The
top of the table is large without the
leaf, but with it there is room for even
the largest of articles. The leaf is upon
the back side so as to have the most
solid part of the. table where most of
the "bearing on" is done. The shelf be
low affords a permanent resting place
for the clothes basket
The lamp and oil can closet can be
built into the wall when the house is
built, or opportunity may be afforded
in some corner or recess in the kitchen
wall ftr one to be constructed. Its in
terior arrangement is shown in the
illustration. The drop leaf 'below the
door can be raised to a horizontal posi
tion when the lamps are being filled
and cleaned.

and is tied in a fairly tight knot, while
the four-in-hand shown on the sharp

the ends as above, though of course
narrower around the collar, and is tied
in a somewhat larger and more bulky

with simple white dot triangular fig
ure, illustrates how completely fashion
has forsaken the old bat wing and but
terfly shapes and the pointed end in
vogue for so long. The collar on whichI
it is tied is one of the best cuts for a
bow, having a narrow opening and
straight lines from the top of the band

USEFUL ASBESTUS.
Bought by the Yard, It Can Be Turn
ed to Many Purposes.
Nearly all housekeepers have several
tin edged asbestus mats which are de
signed purposely for use on the range
beneath saucepans and other cooking
utensils; but perhaps there are many
people who do not realize to how many
other uses in the household asbestus
may be subjected. It comes in sheets
a yard or more in width and of any de
sired length. When bodght by the
quantity, it is very cheap-so cheap
that 10 cents will buy several square
feet of the material, which may, be
easily cut to fit the place it is needed to
fill.
In place of the ready made pads for
protecting polished tables a'strip of as
bestus bought by the yard and cut the
proper length makes a good covering.
When no lining or pad is used on a ta
ble, a small square of the material
placed beneath the cloth where the cof
feepot and teapot stand will save the
table from white marks that a tile is
usually unable to prevent.
All doilies used on a polished table
without a cloth should have inner lin
ings. so that an asbestus mat can be
slipped in between.
A square of asbestus kept for a rest
and also to rub off the flatiron when
in use prevents all scorching of the
ironing sheet. When the range or any
other heating apparatus comes too
close to the wall and there is danger
from fire, a strip of the material placed
between will remove all cause of anx
iety. In houses without hot and cold
water fixtures it is a good plan to slip
a piece beneath the washstand cover
for the hot water pitcher.-Table Talk.

set into shaped pieces of velvet. A titx
"Jesuit" collar of velvet gi es a pretty
finishing touch to this plain ceiow neck

this design well.
The skirt is a five piece one cut tc

That ever new question, the shape
of the fashionable skirt, is not a safe
subject for positive assertions, but
many indications point to shorter and
fuller skirts in the future. Round

much in evidence. According to Paris

The Way to Broi.
A hot, clear fire is indispensable.
The gridiron should be scrupulously
clean and heated thoroughly before the
broil is put on it.
Grease the bars of the gridiron with
suet or kitchen fat; never with butter.
Meat needs plenty of flare; fish but
little.
Put meat so near the fire that it will
be in the flare which the fat drops
cause. As soon as the surface on one
side is browned turn and brown the
other side.
After this turn frequently and re
move a little from the fire to finish
cooking.
Beef an inch thick will require from
fifteen to twenty minutes' broiling.
Trim off the skin from mutton chops,
leave only fat enough to make them
palatable, and broil about ten min
utes. Serve on a hot dish, and put a
piece of butter and a few drops of lem
on juice on each chop.
Broil pork chops in the same way.
Pointers For the Cook.
Rub tough meat with a cut lemon.
Use bacon fat for frying chickens or
game.
Try dipping sliced onions in milk be
fore frying.
Sharpep all kinds of fish sauce with
lemon juice.
Grape juice gives a delicious flavor
ing to mince pies.
Bean soup is much improved by add
ing a little mace just before serving.
Chocolate is greatly improved by add
ing a teacup of strong coffee just be
fore serving.
To improve sweetbreads and give a
fine flavor soak them in a mild lemon
juice water one hour, then boil in beef
stock twenty minutes.
