Tins Seminole .—We invite at
tention to the advertisement of
Captain Mitchell, Riving notice
that he has secured the tine Steam
er Seminole, and will run her here
after in the place of the Fleta. The
Seminole is a new boat, in perfect
order and repair, and is a better
boat than flip St. Mary, Captain
Mitchell informs us. As the Semi
nole will have the same officers that
thcFJetahad and there will only
be a change of boats and no change
of officers, the shippers and travel
ers of the Grand Eeore trade will
lind it to be more than ever to their
advantage to patronize Capt. Mitch
ell. Jt is tobe said in his favor
that ho gave ns a regular low wa
ter boat all last Spring, Summer
and Fall, when we were sadly in
need of one, and the people should
support those who stick to them.
There can be found no more clever
und deserving officers and gentle
men than is to be found on the
Seminole.

of late been so crowded arid hurri
ed that we unintentionally omitted
to notice the return of Mr. Jonas
Rosenthal, with a fine assortment
of all kinds of goods in the Dry

lilies. Ilehas one of the best se
lected stocks in town atf will be
easily verified by a visit to his pop
ular store corner Second and Mur
ray Streets, and he sells all of bis
goods at a reasonable advance on
ly on New Orleans prices. Jonas
is himself a smiling, pleasant gen
tleman, and it is worth one's while
to give him a call just for the pleas
ure of buying from him.
Christmas G ifts .—We were the
recipients of several Christmas gifts
from numerous friends oil Christ
mas day for which we beg to assure
the donors we are duly thankful
and which we highly appreciate.
Our Christmas dinner table was
generously supplied with excellent
wine and as we drank it we did not
forget to wish them as we do now
the enjoyment of many more returns
of a merry Christmas.
C^Tlie Selina under the com
mand of Capt. Jacobs, and with
the other officers of tlio Southwes
tern, who are all exceedingly pleas
ant and obliging gentlemen, cajne
up this week in the place of the
new Bart Able tempororily. The
Bart Able started out last week
but broke her cyleuder just as she
was leaving the wharf, and had to
lay np tor repairs.
The Steamer Garry Owen in
coming over the Falls on her down
trip Sunday night, struck a rock
aud throw off about one hundred
and thirty bales of cotton, which
was all caught here. This is the
second time the wreckers have had
a job lately, and they find that it
pays pretty well at a salvage of
$'i.5U per bale.
CT Rain and mud have been iu
order for Christmas week. The!
roads are bad as is tobe expected,
aud it is too late now to r?medy the
matter.
TEE FAECE ENDED.
At last after a great parade of
honest intentions and virtuous indig
nation at the bare mention of fraud
the partisan, corrupt and perjured
Returning Board who were sworn
to make an honest count of the
returns, have done what everybody
knew they intended to do from the
very beginning, and have with an
audacity that is amazing and impu
dence which shows in what con
tempt they hold the sovereign will
of the people, counted in a majority
of two for the Radicals in the
House of Representatives and have
declared elected the defeated can
didates iu most of the country par
ishes. Rapides is counted out with
tlo single exception of Judge
Daigre whom they declare elected
by only fifty majority, when in fact
his majority was over five hundred,
To arrive at this mathematical re
sult so different from the emphati
cally expressed wish of the electors
both white and black, it was neces
sary to throw out the boxes at Co
tile, Paul's and Big Island. The
pretext in the case of the Paul's
Store box wo understand to have
been that instead of carrying out.
the full figures for the vote of each
candidate, the vote for each being
the same, the commissioners of
election used the univcrsaly mark
(") to indicate that the vote was
the same. The returns were ac
companied by the sworn statement
of the commissioners that the
marks meant that the majorities
were the same. In the case of the
other two boxes we learn that the
pretext M as that the returns were
not sworn to although tfcey were
signed by the commissioners and
the tally sheets showed that the
vote was correct and was even bet
ter evidence of that fact than the
oath of the commissioners. These
are but flimsy pretexts upon which
to attempt to defeat the solemn
will of the people of this parish,
and it will avail them but little
that they have tried to swindle us
out of our victory.
Tli3 two questions which have
been passed from one to another of
our people since the news reached
us are: "What are we going to do
about it !" "Will the people stand
it?" We think that we know the
temper of the people of this parish
well enough to answer for them the
second question with an emphatic
No ! they will not stand it! Mr.
Clements who is returned elected
for Sheriff says that he knows he
was beaten and that he will not
be counted in, that he will notre
ceivc a commission. If the other
defeated candidates are disposed to
claim what they know they are not
entitled to have, we think that
there are enough men in Rapides
to eject them from their offices,
should they bo installed by the U.
S. bayonets. We tell them now
that they nhaJI, not hare the offices.—
Unless they wish to arouse the cou
chant lion whose spring will be cer
tain they had better not attempt to
exercise the duties of officers for
which they well know they were
fairly beaten. We say this not for
tin; purpose of intimidating any onr,
but only to give them fair warning.
If they attempt it the consequences
be upon their own heads.
! to organize,
In reply to the first question as
to what we will do about it, the on
ly solution that we can discover is
to content ourselves with having
no officers at all for the next fwo
years. We will have a legal Judge!
of the Parish Court and the Clerk
. .
ism by virtue of the Usurpation
■ t . .
m 1872 tat « can have „0 Court
without a blicnfi, aud as we do not
■suppose the Isurper Kellogg «rill
commission our legally elected
Sheriff, Mr. I). C. Paul, we propose
that as much preferable to having
anybody else, we don't have any
body at all. Two of the members
of the Police Jury, Messrs Knelling
and Ostaru will not, of course;
claim to have been elected, aud if'
the three negroes should attempt!
1
they will not be per
I mit ted to do so. We have 110 idea
that they will try it.
The question of the election of

cidcd it may be well for Crawford,
Conaughton and DeLacy to know
that they will have to assume the
full responsibility of being promi
nent actors in the plot to swindle the
people of Rapides out of their hon
est and fairly won victory at the
polls.
lu al! seriousness and to use a
slang expression it will be well for
the radicals here to know that " we
mean limitless" this time. The peo
ple know that they and everybody
voted peaceably and that their can
didates were fairly elected, and
they have come to the conclusion
that they will have to try other
than the peaceable means of the
ballott to rid themselves of officers
whom they have twice fairly beaten
at the polls and whoso prticlivities,
practices and incompetence is ex
ceedingly distaseful to them.
Tho Late D. C. Byarly.
Mr. D. C. Byerly, the Manager
of the New Orleans Bulletin, who
i 7
was stabbed by Ex-Gov. Warmoth,
died of his wounds on last Satur
day night about ten hours after the
difficulty. We are not sufficiently
well acquainted with v tho facts to
venture any comments on the diffi
culty which occasioned his death.
It occurs to uk that the deceased
was rather hasty in making the at
tack upon Warmoth. after a chal
lenge had passed, between him and
Mr Jewel of the Bulletin and had
been accepted. Be that as it may,
Mr. Byarly jias answered for it
with his life, and that is Jiot now a
subject for discussion.
We were slightly acquainted with
Mr. Byarly and know l/iin to have
been a brave, chivalrous gentle
man, and wo are sincerely pained
at his death. We are apprehen
sive of its consequences upon the
Bulletin that bold and fearless de
fender of the people's rights, for the
deceased was tho head and front of
that enterprise. The people ol
Louisiana have lost a noble cham
pion and his loss at this time will
be seriously leit. His bold and
undaunted course in the conduct
of his paper in the face of opposi
tion and persecution have endear
ed his name to the whole people of
this State, and it will go down to
posterity as a synonym for all that
is noble, generous and brave.

THE OLD AND NEW YEAR.
"The year has gone, and with it
many a glorious throng of happy
dreams. It's mark is on each brow.
Its shadow in each heart. In its
swift course it waved its sceptre
o'er the beautiful, aud they are
not."
"The faded year is nothing now.
The flowers, the birds, the waves,
the^streams, the melodies of vernal
life and nature will soon comeback
but he returns no more." There
are moments in life, when we seem
to loose all hope, when the soul sits
torpid iu motionless despair, it is
at such times that we ask why it is
that man so full of life, and life's
best attributes should pass away,
while such perishing things as the
trees, the flowers, the rough work
of the carpenter's hands, remain
long after tho spirit that planted
aud fashioned them has been for
gotten.
The old year is passing away in
tears, the damp wintry blasts that
have borne it away from us, are fit
emblems of the wintry chills that
have swept away the sweet illus
ions of youth. Blighted hopes—
broken friendships, all attest that
we have tread the thorny path of
life, and weep in vain. "For the
tender grace of a day that is dead.
To every thinking mind, how sad
inevitably must be tho retrospec
tion of tho
IIow little we have accomplished !
how our worldly plans have proved
indeed only chateaux en Espagne !
how impatient, how fretful over the
daily cares of life! how we have
withheld tho "soft answer that
turneth away wrath" and given
rather the angry retort ! In short
how unsatisfactory our course has
been. Blessed are those who have
faith that the "abiding city" is far
beyond all power of change or de
cay. Thus were it not for that
spark of Divinity which assures us
that this Life ends not here, we
could not rally from tho gloom of
weeping skies, and mournful re
flections, but with the returning
sunshine, creeps in tho little gleam
of Hope which bids us welcome the
New Year as the harbinger of
brighter, and happier days. "Le
roi est mort, vive le roi," was the
French method of proclaiming the
death of the old, and advent of the
new King; and it is echoed in our
hearts with tho birth 6f every New
Year's Day.

"Chomlin" and "Chemiloon."
MRS. SWISSHKLM'S NEW ARTICLE
FOR FEMALE UNDERWEAR.
[From tlio Woman's Journal, Dec. 5.J
So many have written to me
about the "Chemlin,"and so much
interest is exhibited on the subject
lof dress reform, that I beg space in
these columns for a description of
my inventions. I am assured that
several of them are patentable, and
to prevent anyone from making
private property of what I prefer
should be a public benefit, I shall
try to instruct my readers in the
art and mystery of making each
and all of these improved gar
ments.
First there is the "chcmlin," a
combination of closed drawejs and
long-sleeved chemise. The front
has a full bosom, and opening
enough to pass the head through.
There is a btoad hem in the center
and a facing around each sleeve
running down to the drawers, as a
foundation for buttons and button
holes. The back is like that of a
short sack nightgown, with a Y
shaped facing, from tho center of
each shoulder and meeting in the
back, with one which runs down
for a button or button-hole to sup
port outside or inside drawer?.
The drawers are open at tho right
sido and across the back, which
gives the opening thiough which
one gets in, first the upper, then
the lower, part of the body, and
with one button 011 the riglit side
on the drawers and one at the
throat, are completely covered,
without fear of gaps or exposure.
The shoulders fit exactly, and are
short, leaving the joint to work in
the sleeves. Made of flannel or
muslin they support knit drawers
perfectly, by putting buttons 011
the drawers and button holes in the
chenil in, while the facings give
points for support for outside draw
ers, skirts and stockings.
I think it better to have knit un
derwear in two parts; for there is
.•+> much drag in a knit garment
reaching from shoulders to ankles,
that it greatly increases the wear
and is less comfortable, but with
knit drawers buttoned to the chem
I111 and tho usual wrapper coming
down to meet them, these troubles
are obviated without the doubling!
folds; but I fasten nothing to the)
chemlin. For support I use the
"carry all," which is a substitute
for corsets, fits the figure, isbnt-j
toned up in front, supports the
^ a |, (1 affor( ,J ^ ^
and affords support
stockings, outside drawers aud
skirts.
Then there is the "skirt-Repport
er" for outside skirts, which are
separate from the back or waist.
This is composed of broad straps,
crossed behind, passing over the
shoulder, and meeting in front with
a double set of narrow straps, two
of which cross in front, while the
other two pass down at each side.
These straps are of firm cloth,
ted, should
double, are easily adjusted,
be sewed fast to the band of the
dress ; they give a perfect sense of
security and of regular, even sup
port.
Then there is the "underdress,"
which lits the figure like a glove,
supports the bust, and has a puffed
front that may bo made to take the
place of pads. It terminates in a
skirt, can easily support drawers,
stockings, and outside skirt with
out dragging the bust pufls; and
for summer is a nice substitute for
both chemise and corsets.
Last, there is the "gaiter draw
ers the lower part, of waterproof.
fitting the ankle, covering the in
,»tep an.I butterie.1 up on'tlie oat-j
„y,.. The upper part closed, draw- :
ers of any mater ia^war m enough to;
supersede the necessity for a @ «kirt
under the dress, if the latter is lin-j
cd. These are buttoned to the]
"carry all," are invaluable fop
walking or riding in cold or wet
weather, and are easily exchanged
for skirts on coming in, if one
wishes the change.
I trust I have made the descrip
tions so plain that any one can con
struct either or all of these arti
cle«, if they desire, remembering
that the main ideas are nni'ortn
covering of the body, warmth with
out a burden of dry go 4*, ÇD»m to
breathe, divorce from whalAongï
and such an arrangement that all
the weight comes on the shoulder
above the joint, and is evenly dis
tributed between the neqp ja«d
part of the shonlders. To alt wo
men let me say, that mu 40
breathe in a first necessity, rooj
walk is of bnt little leas im
and women jqqat stop Kakih_
sticks of their bodies before th _
can have health, or ought to exeiv
eise their right to the ballot* H
