VETERANS’ CORNER
CLAIMS THAT GENERAL FORREST
RANKS ZEB STUART.
Friend Watson: —In the February
number of your truly interesting
Magazine occurs this statement:
“Who was the most splendid Com
mander of Independent Cavalry the
world ever saw? General ‘Zeb’
Stuart.’ ”
Surely, Brother Watson, you’ll ac
knowledge that you are mistaken in
this assertion. The greatest com
mander of cavalry, living or dead,
was General N. B. Forrest, and there
are not wanting able military men
who as good as declare that he was
the ablest leader that the Civil War
developed. He was not the Gay Cav
alier, theatrically clad, but he was
“The Wizard of the Saddle” and in
battle
“Fierce as ten furies and terrible
as Hell.”
Stuart was wise and brave, a
mighty chieftain indeed, but he had
no such capacity for war as had For
rest.
General D. H. Hill, fresh from the
battlefields of Virginia, viewed with
awe the warlike behavior and mar
tial spirit of Forrest’s command, at
Chickamauga.
Stuart was more fortunate than
Forrest inasmuch as he had for his
Boswell the gifted John Esten
Cooke. We hear more of Stuart, it
is true, just as we hear more of
James Russell Lowell than we do of
George D. Prentice, although Pren
tice’s “Closing Year” is worth all of
Lowell’s poems put together. Chaun
cy Depew is hailed as a mighty ora
tor, but your old school-teacher
made one speech that was greater
than all of Depew’s tiresome twaddle
put together. Most of the histories
we read relate small skirmishes that
occurred in Virginia and pass over
pitched battles of the West and
Southwest without mention.
When the West Pointers surren
dered Fort Donaldson, Forrest gave
them “a chunk of a cussing” and
brought hi ' men out. This should
have been notice to the Richmond
authorities that a Napoleon was
among them, but no, they could nev
er get over the idea that he was not
from West Point. He should have
at once been placed in command of
an army. West Pointers could have

Wouldn’t it be nice within a week or
so to begin to say goodbye forever to
the scalding, dribbling, straining, or
too frequent passage of urine; the fore
head and the back-of-the-head aches;
the stitches and pains in the back; the
growing muscle weakness; spots before
the eyes; yellow skin; sluggish bow
els; swollen eyelids or ankles; leg
cramps; unnatural short breath; sleep
lessness and the despondency?
I have a recipe for these troubles
that you can depend on, and if you
want to make a quick recovery, you
ought to write and get a copy of it.
Many a doctor would charge you $3.50
.just for writing this prescription, but I
have it and will be glad to send it to
you entirely free. Just drop me a line
like this: Dr. A. E. Robinson, 1J657
Luck Building, Detroit, Mich., and I
will send it by return mail in a plain
envelope. As you will see when you
get it, this recipe contains only pure,
harmless remedies, but it has great
healing and pain-conquering power.
It will quickly show its power once
you use it, so I think you had better
see what it is without delay. I will
send you a copy free—you can use it
and cure yourself at home.

It was N. B. Forrest and John H.

Comment.
(I have always considered General
Forrest as the greatest of all “nat
ural born” soldiers. He was not a
mere cavalry officer as Prince Rupert
and Murat, and La Salle were. He,
like Stuart, could handle infantry
and artillery. Did not the tactics of
Ashby and Stuart suggest those of
Forrest and Morgan? Come along
Brer Lauderdale, and tell us all about
it. Yours truly,
FEEBLE CHIRP.)
A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER’S
RETROSPECT.
Comrades, we are soldiers —
Consuming civil strife,
Delayed in North and South
The onward trend of life.
The glowing heat of passion
Surpassing everywhere,
Wreathed a “crown of thorns”
For every soul to wear.
But so the fates decreed,
Our heritage we defend,
In noble, honest, battle
’Gainst thrice our number of men.
Honor, the sole inspiration,
Kept strong the firing line;
’Mid scenes of desolation,
Inspired the wearied mind.
Rugged hills we climbed,
Through silent vales we tramped,
Beneath a tranquil sky,
By flowing streams we camped.
Hungry, weary, cold,
At nights we often lay;
Our blankets around we fold
And will unrest away.
Recall tne moving host,
The shifting hue of gray,
Each faithful to his post,
In brilliant battle array.
We hear the music sound,
The band begins to play,
The thrill of Dixie Land
Restrengthens for the fray.
Two lines of rifles flash
And through the trembling air,
The groans of dying men,
Are pleading everywhere.
The veil of smoke uplifts,
Changing scenes unfold,
The glamour of glory shifts,
The ranks their courage hold.
All through the flashing tumult,
The silent force of skill,
Directs the trend of battle
To grace the sovereign will.
The gunnery ceases firing,
The tumult dies away,
A sombre, silent, scene
Bespeaks the close of day.
That doleful period departs,
Sufferings untold have fled—
Enfeebled and old, the living,
Silent in peace, the dead.
The severed cords are healing,
Mutual good-will extends
Embracing brotherly feeling,
On which our glory depends.
Our blessings upon the Union,
Ere sleeps our forms enfold,
May sober, silent wisdom,
Her sleepless vigils hold.

will lay bare the foul and bloody
record of the Roman Catholic Hier
archy, is in the April number of
WATSON’S MAGAZINE
IO cents; SI.OO a year. Thomson, Ga.
AN OLD VETERAN WHO WANTED
JUSTICE.
My Dear Sir: —Your article on
disorderly conduct in last week’s
Jeffersonian has shed a flood of light
throughout The Jeffersonian’s terri
tory. We wish to ask your opinion
on a point of law.
We went before the Quitman
county Grand Jury last week with a
case of hog stealing, expecting to
have no trouble in getting a true
bill against the hog thieves. My hog
left home Friday morning, after a
heavy flood of rain Thursday even
ing, which lasted after night. Our
hog did not come home Friday night.
We went in search of it Saturday
morning, tracked it to where it was
killed. I got a search warrant, and
went with the bailiff to where the
hog was killed, found the tenant’s
wife was preparing a pot full of the
meat for supper, and when asked by
the bailiff where she got the meat,
said her husband and his brother
brought it there. The Solicitor said
that these facts were not conclusive
evidence that the negro stole the
hog. He as|ked me if my hog was
male or female. I stated that it
was a female. He asked me if I
could tell when I found the meat in
the negro’s house if it was a male
or a female. Some members of the
Grand Jury wanted to know if we
could swear that the blood we saw
was not goat’s blood. The landlord
who claims this tenant as his is a
rich Alabamian and was on hand
during court. I am an ex-Confed
erate soldier, seventy years old, and
can only look to the Courts to pro
tect my person and scant property.
Thomson, Ga. E. N. KING.
To the Old Guard and the Young
So many splendid letters have been
received in the last few days from
the “Old Guard”, responding to my
call a few weeks ago, that I take this
method of answering them through
the columns of The Jeffersonian. I
desire to say that I very much appre
ciate the fine letters received; to
read them would indicate that the
“OLD GUARD” is ready to march
at the tap of the drum.
I believe steps should be imme
diately taken to reorganize in every
State at once. I believe that those
who were in earnest in marching un
der the banners of the Omaha plat
form in the 90’s are willing and anx
ious to take up the “march” now.
Once truly converted to our creed,
no change of heart is likely to occur
under present conditions; and I must
say that the conditions that forced
the Populist Party into existence
have not changed, except for the
worst.
I would merely suggest that Chair
man Ferris select some wide-awake
Populist to take up the work of or
ganization at once; let the person
selected work on a salary basis, and
put an organization in every State as
fast as possible. We need a business
party organization, a paying mem
bership, salaried officers, etc. I will
give $5 to start the work, how much
will you give, brother? Let us know
at once through The Jeffersonian
just how much you are willing to
give. “SPEAK OUT QUICK”.
Let’s hear from the editor on this
matter.
Yours for action,
B. F. ARNOLD.
