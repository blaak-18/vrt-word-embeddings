The Unemployed.
N. 0. Picayune.
The long promised revival of lu
,la1,s which the whole conntry has
lI ein looking for so anxiously is slow
i getting under way. The hard
t i:es have been with us so long that
, vry one, we might say, is growing
tvmistoimed to them, except that large
Srmiilr whose means of earning daily
I r-.ad ate threatened by the continn
,I ldeprission. IHow to start again
I the activities of commerce, and
renew all the industrial energies of
):i. great nation; how to establish
:,lnlidence in the future and find
Iprofit in general production, so that

S,!io are out ofemploynment, and wi:hl
uo prospect of permanent labor,
p liroblems which coimniand the
rt!ughtful consideration of leading
Si ads throughout the country.
The rapid progress and increase of
l.hor-saving machines, the man;,
!:anges in the inmethods of business
' i:ich steam and the telegraph and
r :'chanical ingenuity have brought
4 ,at, have disturbed the relations
I producer and consumer. This
:ont of proportion is stated by Mr.
s; uard Atkinson, of Boston, as fol
+is: "At present ninety per cent.
our population, using improved
1t:l is and machines, can produce all
:t one hundred per cent. can con
..:'e of the staple articles of food,
r "I, clothing, tools, ware and the
. , which constitute the bulk of
oirsumption, and can, in addition,
i.. ,duce all that we have yet been able
.. lied a market for abroad." Ac
, riling to this estimate, which con
t, ,liporary writers upon the same
t. i.ject consider moderate, there re
mains ten per cent. without the op
i.it unity for employment.
'1r. David A. Wells, writing to the
+:, rth American Review, concludes
K.,t the labor of 225 persons is as ef
f ti ive in 1876 in meeting the de
, ;lids of the country for cloth and
., d products as wits the labor of 691
, ' sons in effecting similar results in
I':. On account of this change in
ilducing power the labor of 466 per
,. a, is dispensed with in doing the
i. e work. The same writer instanc
, similar results in other depart
t.u BIts of industry.
'These figures are of course approx
i:..atious, Lut they present the gravrt
), tire of the problem which will
I I(.s for a solution upon the political
+.,iuomists of the present day. The
I. ...r which has been displaced by
i , changes in methods of business
.;i the improvements in machinery,
tiled to the recent depression in
. limerce and industry, will not be
:'ilty provided for. Many of the un
:1ldoyed, trained to special kinds of
,+uk, will find it difficult to assume
r ,w relations and different pursuits.
L,iany of them, too, may wait in vain
I. v years for an opportunity to return
,,' the occupation from which they
I ' , e been crowded out.
The only refuge for those who are
1 Is to perform such labor seems to
I:r in agriculture, and the best field
i,, :Pek for this kind of employment
i.r iu the South. There is now and
iil continue to be a demand in the
s. nth for steady, intelligent farm la.
tlters, and the demand will increase
a. rthe fertility of our Southwestern

For the principles by whlich Tile World
o will Ie gve'rned in its discussion and
Streatment of thle public questions, it \ill
Ssnfltice to say that T'he World, while con
servative in polities, desires the conseva
tionll only of what is good and wise in our
public institions and no limitations upon
thle right of pliivate judgment and the
asplirations of Reform, save those wlich
are iliposed by pruldence. decorulm, and
- a rational respect for vested rights and
for the honest oplinions of all classes and
sects of men. While it has labored for
the principles and hails tlhe triumphof
tile Democratic party as aftording USa
practical prolnise of Reform ill our public
- administrations, city, state anld nlational~,
it will not be blindly devoted to the ad
vancelent of any party or any clique.
It will freely canvass thile public conduct
while it will treat with respect thopra
vate righlts, of Public Men, and it will es.
annue fearlessy into the workings of onr
nationllal, state and municipal gover
e Iaents.
It will inenulcate a steadfast relianne
d upon the original principles lof our poli
' tical systemll as the lonly sonlllld basis of aill
Sneceded imlporvenent therein; an unfalt
d ering devotion to tlhe Constitution and
' the Unioll, a scrupulous lidolity tothe
Sspirit as well as Ilhe letter ofourlawsr
e alld a sleepless vigilance in mlintaintainig
1- all thle great safieguralds of Civil au
Religious Liberty. It will seek tomit
Sigtte and not to aggravate the evilsin
al separable from Party Government in a
l Free Country; to promote ngood and not
n ill feeling amnlong our fellow-citzens of all
' creeds and colors, all sections and all
sects; anld to ruavanllce both b1,y its pre
cepts anld by its example the reign of
to Reasom and of Law over IPrejudice and
pas~sion in all our pubilic action and in
the discussion ol' all public aftlairs.
It will do justice always, to thle best of
its ability to all men and to all classes of
r. In(en ; it will recognize 1no enemiesC but the
e onemies of good nlorals, public order and
the law; it will endeavor, in a word, to
nmake its columns a terror to evil-doen
and a praise to them that do well.
Nor will it lose night meanwhile of the
er great and legitimate demand of the
, reading pulic ftor entertrainnitlllt. Thbe

of all that is amusing as well asofll
that is lmomentols in the movmonotsof
