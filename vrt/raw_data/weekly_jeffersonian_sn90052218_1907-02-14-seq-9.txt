If softe are- direction, and
some in another—“farewell Edye!”—there
can’t bq successful co-operation.
Apply these principles to the organization
of the Farmers, and then ask yourself how it is
possible for Harvie Jordan’s conglomerated
Mutual-Aid, job-lot assortment to ever rep
resent the Farmer. Is the Manufacturer’s
self-interest on a parallel line to that of the
Farmer?
No.
At present, the manufacturer is bent upon
holding his Trust-breeding monopoly of the
Home Market, while it is to the self-interest
of the farmer to break it.
If the farmer cannot break up the Home
Market monopoly which yields such monsters
as the Steel Trust a profit of 80 per cent per
year—then the farmer is a ruined man.
This being true, why should the farmer al
low any protected manufacturer to enter into
the farmers’ organization?
All the manufacturers are banded together
in their own Association, and the purpose of
their Association is antagonistic to the self
interest of the farmer: how then can there be
co-operation between the two?
It is absolutely necessary that the farmers
broaden their market so as to increase the con
sumption of raw cotton. Cotton fabrics must
be cheapened by foreign competition; thus a
greater amount of the goods will be sold; thus
will be created a demand for a greater amount
of raw cotton; thus the Demand will be in
creased; thus the price will be advanced.
In no other way can you permanently in
crease the demand and the price.
But here your interests and those of the
Protected Manufacturers clash.
How, then, can you co-operate?
You can’t —and all thinking men will see it.
Listen:
The parallel line is necessary to co-opera
tion .
Those who successfully co-operate are those
who march in the same direction, inspired by
the same motive, to reach the same object.
Farmers! Reject all members who cannot
be shown eligible by this rule.
LOCATION OF AGRICULTURAL
SCHOOLS.
(From Prof. J. F. Stewart’s Re
port to Board of Trustees, State Uni
versity).
The following are the accepted bids
for the district agricultural schools
of Georgia. The total value of the
bids is nearly $850,000, and the re
jected bids amount to fully as much.
It is a splendid tribute to the pro
gressive spirit of the Georgia farmer,
and to the wisdom of the plans of
the proposed schools.
First District—Statesboro. Sixty
thousand dollars cash; 300 acres of
land, $20,000; electric light, water
and sewerage, $20,000.

The real cause is not the shortage of cars,
as claimed by the railroads, but is due to,
differences between the transportation com
panies and the consignees over demurrage
charges. Several thousand cars of coal are
being held in Chicago, Minneapolis and other
cities because of these differences. The Pres
ident has ordered a special investigation, and
he promises to lay the facts before Congress
and demand legislation that will prevent such
conditions in the future.

People are freezing to death in the North
west because they cannot get fuel. Some
weeks ago Senator Hansbrough, of North Da
kota, asked the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion to relieve the situation, but nothing has
been done.
The railroads claim that they cannot get
enough cars to haul freight offered the roads.
It is such methods that force changes, and
there will soon be a radical change in the man
agement of railroads in the United States.
The people are sick and tired of the railroads
running the government and ruling the peo
ple, and they are going to change things
around by letting* the'people own the railroads
and run the government to suit themselves.

The farmers of the country will be amused
and edified, if not convinced, by reading the
eloquent defense which Joe Hoadley, the Wall
Street Cotton Gambler, makes of Harvie Jor
dan. The intimacy which exists between Har
vie Jordan and this Wall Street Cotton Gam
bler in stocks, bonds and cotton futures, would
seem to extend also to the ladies of the two
families, for in the society columns of The
Atlanta Constitution of Thursday, Jan. 24,
1907, I find this interesting item:

Seed Distribution Reinsed.
The chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry has
devised a new system of seed and plant distribu
tion, which he hopes to persuade Congress to adopt
in place of the useless method which has come
n for so much criticism, of recent years. This plan
consists in the introduction of new varieties of seeds
and plants, together with the publication of infor
mation bearing on ther cultivation. These se.eds,
plants and bulletins will be distributed on the or
der of members of congress to farmers whom they
will name. In outlining his plan, Dr. Galloway
has submitted to the members of the agricultural
commt tees’ eighteen sub-divisions, among them
being, “ extension of Alfalfa into states where it
is not now a staple crop.” Tobacco, winter oats,
sugar beets and corn will be among the new va
rieties introduced, and special attention will be
paid to dry land arboriculture.
