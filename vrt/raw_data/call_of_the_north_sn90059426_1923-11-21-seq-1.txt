Barnesville, Minn, Nov. 14—Special
Dispatch.—The Reverend Fink last
night was molested by policeman Tim
O’Leary of Barnes ville at a public Ku
Klux Klan meeting held here. The
mayor of Barnes ville and policeman
O’Leary bolted through the door of
the hall just as the Protestant min-
ister was about to dismiss with a
prayer. The mayor and policeman on
/ entering the hall shouted “Cut this—
cut this.” When asked what the
charges were, they were overcome
with cold feet and left the hall. Af
ter the meeting the Reverend Fink
and his assistant went to the mayor’s
saloon and there asked “His Honor” if
he wanted to arrest them. In reply
the mayor said, “I don’t want you, I
only wanted to bireak up that meet
ing.”
Let the reader get some facts clear
ly established in his mind. First, the
hall at Barnesville, where the Ku
Klux Klan meeting was held had been
previously rented and there was no
question as to the right of the Klans
men to hold the meeting in that par
ticular place. .Secondly, our Consti
tution gives to every person on Amer
ican soil the right of public assem
blage and free speech. Therefore the
Klansmen who conducted the K. K. K.
meeting at Barnesville were absolute
ly within their rights. .There is every
reason to believe that the mayor and
policeman knew this, but yet ignored
entirely the right of the Protestant
minister to conduct the Klan meeting,
in their bonehead efforts to serve as
instruments of hate and intimidation.
There is a clear case against the
mayor and Tim O’Leary of Barnes
ville. The Call of the North demands
that they be prosecuted to the full ex
tent of the law. Straightway we will
place the matter in the hands of our
attorney for legal action. Protest
ants have stood too much of this hard
jstuff and it is time to call a halt to
such highhanded mehods. When Pro
testants can’t hold a meeting where
the betterment of America is careful
ly considered, without attempted in
timidation, things are in a dangerous
condition. If the people of Barnes
ville do not demand an investigation
of their mayor’s and policeman Tim
O’Leary’s conduct in connection with
the Ku Klux Klan meeting of last
night, they are delinquent in their re
sponsibilities as citizens. When a pub
lic official deliberately goes out of his
way to terrorize Protestants, he is
guilty of malfeasance.
The Kind of Men That Fight the Ku
Klux Klan are a Recommenda
tion for the Great Order
The best argument in favor of the
Ku Klux Klan are the enemies the
great movement has to contend with.
We have personally talked with many
men who went into the Klan as a pro
test against her foes. They loved the
organization because of the character
of those who hated it. Many people
may not see the need of the Ku Klux
Klan and some may doubt the wisdom
of the organization at this time. But
no open-eyed American will fail to
understand her foes and their crusade
against her. Those foes and that
crusade are the very best recommend
ations that the Ku Klux Klan has to
day and she really needs no better.
Who wfents a better proof of a gen
uine worthwhileness, of any organiza
tion than the solid opposition of all
un-American and pro-criminal forces!
Good men everywhere are coming to
understand that the Klan is danger
ous only to the lawless and un-Amer
ican dement within our midst.

STOP KLAN MEETING: RETREATS
KING KLEAGLE SPEAKS
TO ST. PAUL KLAN
St. Paul, Minn.—The St. Paul or
ganization held a very interesting
meeting last Monday night, when a
very large crowd was present and
nany candidates were naturalized.
Several peppy talks were made by
various members and the program
for the ensuing months was out
lined.
The King Kleagle was in attend
ance and was presented with a flock
of live wild ducks. He invited the
entire bunch to bis home to partake
of the festivities and gave the honor
to the spokesman who presented
them to him, to prepare them for the
feast.
After the presentation of the ducks,
the King KlEagle made a very inter
esting talk on what was going on in
various parts of the state. He said,
in part, that there was only one Im
perial Wizard in the organization
and that was Hiram Wesley Evans,
who was duly and truly elected; that
it w r as up to every Klansman to get
back of his adminstration. He char
acterized the few disgruntled mem
bers who are working as “highway
men in the dark,” as traitors within
the organization and that these men
were purporting that Col. Simmons
was their leader, but, in fact, he is
only being used as a mere tool, and
it is high time that we start a gen
eral house-cleaning to get rid of all
the trouble-makers within the or
ganization; that if Simmons expected
to retain his compensation for life, as
voted by the Kloncilium, we should
insist that he perform the duties as
outlined, to receive such compensa
tion, and let this gang of traitors
alone and sever all connections with
them, as these Judases are working
for their own personal ambitions.
He further stated that, as their
leader, in the state of Minnesota, he
wanted to again make the statement
that he would at all times demand
that every man in the organization
receive a square deal and that the
state office is behind every member
whose heart is right in the organiza
tion and also asked that the members
get behind those in charge of the St.
Paul organization and do their utmost
to make St. Paul and Ramsey county
the largest organization in Klandom.

KLANDOM IN AUSTIN
By ASBESTOS NO. ONE
Austin Klan is rapidly progressing
and plan on taking in a large class
this week. We are looking forward
to a big drive next month, and all
prospects lead us to believe that in
the following few months our mem
bership will be doubled.
Leroy, Dexter and Taopi are doing
their best and surely have some real
100 per cent men.
Brownsdale has come into the lime
light.
We had a large attendance last
week, estimated at 300. Twent-six
aliens signed up and we have been
asked for a return meeting and fully
expect to double our previous num
ber. \
Our emblem, the Fiery Cross,
burned brightly on the main street.
After a short time one of our U. S.
A. mail carriers upset it. There is
no use explaining the reason why
this was done, but ignorance is often
thus used in these cases, so we may
just as well consider the source.
Let the snares and slurs, go drifting,
With the winds, as they come and go;
Let their thoughts and dishonorable
dealings
Act as the seed, which they daily
sew.
The sun will shine brightly upon us,
If we always act as a man,
’Tis through God that we see our
victory;
Yes, we, the Ku Klux Klan.
MER ROUSE “MURDER”
CASE DWINDLES AWAY
Skipworth “Guilty” of Aiding in En-
It’s a far cry from a murder charge
to a $lO fine.
That’s what happened in Mer
Rouge.
Capt. Skipworth and his associates,
who were outstanding figures in the
alleged double murder some months
ago, when the mutilated corpses, or
iginally from some medical college,
were pulled out of a lake and declared
to be the bodies of two alleged miss
ing residents of the community, have
been fined $lO for carrying firearms
on the property of another man.
The sheriff of the county stated on
the stand that Skipworth was acting
as his deputy in conducting a moon
shine raid. Skipworth was aiding the
“duly constituted officers of the law”
and acting at their direction as it
is the duty of every American citi
zen as provided in the constitution-.
And the trial was conducted with
out a jury. The judge was the whole
thing. Even th£ fine of $lO was un
just, and proof of it was presented to
the court, but the judge refused to
accept it.
Yes, it is a far cry from a murder
charge to a $lO fine.

THE GOPHER STATE KU KLUX KLAMS
ARE NOW GOING FULL SPEED AHEAD
DR. KERFOOT SPEAKS FOR ANTI
KLAN ORGANIZATION: BOILS OVER
LET THE ANTI-PROTESTANTS COME—
THE MORE THE MERRIER.
We notice from an Associated Press
dispatch that an organization has
been formed in Washington to be call
ed the National Vigilance Association,
organized for the purpose of fighting
the Ku Klux Klan. This is another
move made by Roman intrigue and
through their jesuit cunning they will
persuade many unmindful and unin
formed Protestants to join their
ranks, but the Klan does not fear the
National Vigilance Association after
reading their announcement, their
aims and their purposes, because the
Klan is founded upon a sublime prin
ciple and God’s eternal word. And
in a statement from their vice pres
ident, Corcocan, we note that he says
that the National Vigilance Associa
tion “is non-religious and non-po
litical.” We expect the former is
true but would stage our life that
the latter is not true. We note that
he says that it »-& bloc for patriotic
purposes.” We note that his state
ment says that the Klan is a “revolu
tion that is shaking the social, eco
nomic, political and religious struc
ture of the country to their very
foundations ”
The Klan is revolutionizing the in
judicial and un-American social, eco
nomic and political life of America
to its very foundations, but the re
ligious structure of the country is be
ing revived. The primitive, Chris
tian, Anglo-Saxon nature of the
white Caucasian people of this na
tion is being aroused, and all of the
opposition that is being raised by
the organization of the Societies to
oppose the Klan will not hinder the
onward march and the gain of in
telligence by the American people.
The National Vigilance Association
will fail to be of much force against
the Klan, due first, because they are
as stated, non-religious, as any body
of people who do not take God into
it will fail, and second, because*they
opppose the Ku Klux Klan, which is
an American Christian organization.
An organization must always be
judged by the kind of men that are
at the head of it and working for its
extension. The newspapers featured
the statement that prominent educa
tors had united for the purpose of
combating the Ku Klux Klan. Let
us state at this point that practically
all the prominent educators revealed
as members of the National Vigilance
Association certainly are not conspic
uous leaders in the field of educa
tion. We will proceed at once to re
veal facts pertaining to some of the
leaders of the new anti-Klan organi
zation.
Read! It and Weep
David Sarnoff, an alien Jew, heads
the list. Then comes James Fergu
son, ex-governor of Texas, who was
impeached and removed from office in
1917 for irregularities not becoming
a public servant. After that, we have
Major Charles F. Kendrick, whose
greatest claim to fame is the anti-
Klan resolution he introduced before
the National Convention of the
American Legion, but which was
smothered into oblivion by a storm of
dissenting ballots. Next is Aldrich
Blake of Oklahoma, the only remain
ing henchman of Gov. Walton, who
now has the same dose as Fergu
son of Texas, impeachment for irreg
ular conduct in office. Following this
we find E. F. Corcoran, the Philadel
phia newspaper man who is going to
run the outfit, is a Roman Catholic,
and Thomas H. Cannon, the promi
nent Chicago Roman -Catholic, must
not be forgotten in the list.
There are 35 men reported as
members and classed as prominent
educators. In “Who’s Who in Ameri
ca” we should find listed all promi
nent educators, but of the 35, we find
that only 18 are listed. Further
analysis discloses that, v while they are
supposed to be educators, only 22 of
the list hold positions or degrees that
would entitle them to the classifica
tion as “educators.” With these 22
educators there are as many colleges
and universities mentioned as the
one/ with which they are associated.
This is what we found concerning the
22 institutions of learning: only five
of them are Protestant, nine claim
no religion at all, only four are state
institutions, one is a Negro college
and three are Roman Catholic.
These are the schools these 22 edu
cators teach in.
Of the men and women listed in
the leadership three are Jesuits, one
is a priest, three are Roman Cath
olic laymen, one is a Negro and one
is a Jew.
Dr. Iverfoot Led Astray
It seems that Dr. Kerfoot has
united hands with the anti-Protest
ants so that he may aid in destroy
ing the great Christian movement
known as the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan. Recently, the president of
Hamline University, St. Paul, gave
out a statement, according to the
daily press, wherein he listed Gov.
J. A. 0. Preus, Lieut. Gov. L. L.
Collins, and Myrtle Caine as mem
bers of the National Vigilance Asso
ciation. The public statement of Dr.
Kerfoot had no more than reached
the public when the governor of Min
nesota, the Lieutenant Governor and
Myrtle Caine repudiated what Dr.
Kerfoot had given out, stating em
phatically that they were not mem
bers of the anti-Klan organization, in
which Dr. Kerfoot seems to have
taken an active interest. It is cer
tain that the Methodists of Minne
sota will not take kindly the stand
of the president of Hamline Uni
versity against the Ku Klux Klan.
Obviously, it is a case, so far as the
president of Hamline University is
concerned, where ignorance concern
ing the great Protestant movement
has led a man of high repute entirely
astray. Judging the National Vigi
lance Association by some of its
leading lights, it stands out conspic
uously as an organization of hate in
which the hereditary enemies of
Protestantism seek to use men of
various walks of life for a sinister
purpose. We are sorry indeed that
a man like Dr. Kerfoot should be
come a part of such an unholy alli
ance.

FLAMING CROSS SET
UP IN ST. PAUL
A flaming cross was set up and lit
across the street from the Cathedral
in St. Paul Tuesday night. No one
saw the persons who placed it there
or set it afire. The light attracted
about 200 persons and men in the
crowd kicked at the base of the cross
until it fell to the ground. The cross
was about ten feet high with a five
foot cross arm. A sign which read,
“Danger, Keep Away," had been set
up nearby.
Also there was a sign which St.
Paul papers failed to mention read,
“Americans Join the K. K. K.”

Real Americans Over the Entire State
Hear Klan Call and Answer “We
Are Coming 100,000 Strong.”
The Ku Klux Klan in Minnesota is
now moving along wil/i a rapidity
that is most encouraging. From all
parts of the state, field workers of
the Klan are sending in reports that
prove beyond a possibility of a doubt
how the appeal of Klancraft is being
received with an enthusiasm unlike
anything experienced up to this date.
The Protestant people of Minnesota
are beginning to appreciate the cry
ing need for a united militant, Amer
ican, Christian movement, like the
Ku Klux Klan. Not in one section of
the state, but over the entire state,
men eligible to citizenship in the In
visible Empire are placing their ap
plications and even begging for op
portunities to serve in the movement.
When we read the large number of
letters of inquiry that come to us
daily, we are filled with the highest
pitch of enthusiasm for the move
ment. Certainly, if there were no
need for the Ku Klux Klan, the think
ing men of weight, over the length
and breadth of Minnesota, would not
go out of their way in order that they
might take a part in uniting
the Protestant forces in the Gopher
state. Although vicious misrepresen
tations and outrageous lies are being
generously promulgated by the her
editary enemies of Protestantism, the
Klan forges ahead and each passing
day shows it gaining greater momen
tum. Persecution and vilification
centered against the Invisible Empire
availeth nothipg. The multitudes
gather from far and near to hear the
gospel of Klancraft as preached and
taught by representatives of Pro
testantism. the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan. There seems to be an
inner hunger for the old-time religion
which the Klan is emphasizing and a
deep desire to see the principles of
the Klan interwoven with the body
fabric of our community, state and
national life. More truly each day
Protestant people of the North Star
State are coming to realize how effec
tive the Klan is as a force for the up
lifting, the regeneration, and the
strengthening of the spiritual, moral
and physical manhood of America.
Conditions in Fergus Falls Show
Need For Klan
A series of meeting were recently
held in Ottertail and Wilkins coun
ties. In no community of these two
counties has thd gospel of Klancraft
fallen on deaf ears. In Fergus Falls,
for example, the Klan meetings have
been well attended and the Klan
membership has already attained
most surprising strength. That Fer
gus Falls will have one of the largest
Klans, on a per capita basis, in the
state of Minnesota, is now a well
recognized fact. In Fergus Falls,
there are conditions existing which
prove the absolute necessity for an
organization like the Ku Klux Klan.
Every thinking citizen of Ottertail
county knows well that an awakened
citizenship alone can accomplish the
many needed reforms. The police de
partment of Fergus Falls should be
shook from stem to stern and brought
face to face with demands for more
effective work. Girls in their early
teens are not safe on the streets of
Fergus Falls, for beasts in human
form deliberately prey upon the chas
tity of girls, yes, even children. Only
a short time ago, several men in an
automobile made several efforts to
entice girls into their automobile,
promising them money if they would
join with them in a vicious frolic. Are
the laws enforced by the police de
partment in Fergus Falls the way
they should be? Ask a real citizen
of that city and he will give you an
answer in most emphatic terms. Are
the police running down the boot
leggers effectively or are they closing
their eyes and turning their backs to
gross violations of the Prohibition
Law? Again we refer you to the
thinking citizens of Fergus Falls for

an answer. One of these days the
citizens of Fergus Falls will speak,
and speak with such force that in
difference on the part of public of
ficials will be met with demands in
language so plain that no one can
misunderstand.
Twelve Year Old Boy Seen Drunk on
Pelican Rapids Streets
A splendid Klan meeting was held
a short time ago at Pelican Rapids.
The theatre of that village was filled
to capacity. The large audience
listened most attentively to the lec
ture on Klan principles. After the
meeting, a large number of the finest
people of Pelican Rapids community
placed their applications for mem
bership in the Kjaights of the Ku Klux
Klan with the field representative of
that Order. On the very night that
fathers of Pelican Rapids were hear
ing the heart-breaking cry for the re
vival of the old-fashioned home and
consecrated parenthood, a boy not
much over twelve, was staggering
the streets, under, the influence of
liquor. Some might contend that this
was merely an isolated case, but many
people came forward and testfied that
there are many things in the North
western part of Ottertail county that
demand attention on the part of
Christian men and women.
At Henning and Vining the Klan
lecturers were well received. Al
ready in these two* villages a large
number of the best people have join
ed hand in hand with the Protestants
of Ottertail county for the purpose
of bettering the community, the state
and the nation.
Mille Lacs and Kanabec Counties on
Map
In Wilkins county, the center of
Klan activities naturally is Breckent
ridge. Recently, the Baptist church
of that city was used for a Ku Klux
Klan meeting. A large number of
the finest people of Breckenridge at
tended. If we were to tell you how
many reputable citizens of Wilkin
county are now members of the Ku
Klux Klan, you would be inclined to
doubt our veracity. In fact, the mem
bership strength of Ottertail, Wil
kins, MilleLacs and Kanabec coun
ties have recently shown unusual
growth. The people of the latter two
counties have not had an opportunity
to get togeher through the agency of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan but
a very short time. Most wonderfully
are they rallying around the Fiery
Cross and Old Glory. Anti-Klan
newspapers filled with distorted facts
and lying propaganda have accom
plished nothing. It is evident that
the people of MilleLacs and Kanabec
counties understand the source of the
attacks made upon the Ku Klux Klan.
It is vary heartening indeed to find
people who have the capacity of
grasping the truth in an unbiased
manner, as is conspicuously true of
the people of these two counties.
Northward moves the Klan up in Pine
county, through foreignism well es
tablished in sections there, on into
Carlton county, up to the very shores
of Lake of the Woods. In the Iron
Range district the Klan has already
gained a permanent foothold. In Be
midji a strong Klan membership has
already been attained and big things
are expected from that city and the
county of which it is a part. Through
concentrated efforts of several«months
in the Southern part of the state, the
Invisible Empire is well established.
Organization details are rapidly being
completed and it won’t be long until
the machinery of Klandom will be
functioning as it Although
the Klans in Southern* Minnesota
have gained a strong membership,
steady growths are revealed by re
ports coming into the office of the Call
of the North.
