surrender of the state-hocse.
On learning of the newly arranged
disposal of the State capitol build
ings, Capt. Mitchell's company of
militia were marched out of the Hall
of Representatives where they had
been placed on guard, and the senti
nels were all withdrawn from the
doorways and staircases.
At 6 o'clock precisely, yesterday
evening, Gen. Brooke marched into
tbe Governors office, without any ac
companiment except Lieutenants
Wallace and Roe. Immediately up
on tbe entrance of Gen, Brooke, Gov.
M cE n ery and Lieut. Gov. Penn arose
and shaking bands with him intro
duced the three Federal officers to
the distinguished citizens of Louisi
ana who were present.
The Governor then stated to Gen.
Brooke that he give him the posses
sion of the State Capitol and all
other State buildings within the
limits of tbe city of New Orleans.
Gen. Brooke merely bowed in accept
ance, and the Governor read the fol
lowing address :
Oen. Brooke—Aa the lawful and
a ctual Governor ofthis State, I sur
render to you, as the rep esenta
tive of the Govern men t of the
United States, tbe Capitol and the
remainder ot tbe property in this
city belonging to the State. This
•artender is in response to a formal
demand of Gen. Euioiy tor such
surrender, or to acceptas an altei
native the levying of war upon our
govern«»*! fcy the militurv forces
of the United States nudes his com
mand.
As I have already "ai 3 to Gen.
Emory, we bave neither tbe power
nor inclination to resist the Govern
ment of tbe United States.
Sir. I transfer to your guaidian
ship the rights and liberties of this
State, and 1 trust and believe that
yon will give protection to all clas
ses of our citizens.
Ruled and mined by an admitted
usurpation, presided over by Mr.
Kellogg, our people could bear the
wrongs, tyranny, arrogance an in
sults of usurpation no longer, and
they arose in tbeir might and swept
it from existence, and installed in
authority the rightful goveinment,
of which I am the head.
All lovers of liberty throughout
this Union must admire the pat
riotism that aroused our people to
arise as one man and throw oft' the
yoke of this odious usurpation.
I know, sir, as a soldier yon have
but to obey the orders of the Gov
ernment ot the United States, but
I feel that you will temper your
military control of affairs with mod
eration, and iu all things exhibit
that integrity of purpose character
istic ot officers of the army.
I now turn over to you, sir, the
Capitol and other property of tbe
State under my charge.
After this addrvss, Gen Brooke
bowed again, was seated in the of
fice, and required from the Lieuten
ant Governor a statement of all the
records, etc., which were iu the
building at the time it was taken
possession ol by the legal Govern
ment.
Gov. Penn promised to furnish
these and then the Governor, Lieu
tenant Governor, Messrs. Marr,
Kllis, Zacharie and other prominent
citizens quietly withdrew, leaving
the Capitol of Louisiana in the pos
session of the United States Gov
ernment.
A very large concourse of people)
had assembled arouml the Capitol I

louisiana.
Y oh are already aware of the
events which transpired in the city
of New Orleans on Monday anil
Tuesday last, which resulted in the
complete overthrow ot the usurp
ing government.
lîy the prompt and spontaneous
action of the people iu the several
parishes this odious usurpation
lias been destroyed effectually, so
that to-day, no vestige of its power
remains; and the Government
chosen and elected by you was in
full operation throughout the State,
and in the exercise of all the pow
ers and functions belonging to it
as a Government de jure and de
facto.
We congratulate you, fellow citi
zens, on this great result. The peo
pie of Louisiana présenta specta
cle grandly sublime, of which they
and their children a'fter them may
well bo proud. On Monday, no
longer able to bear the outrages
ami oppressions of the Kellogg
usurpation, they flew to arms, and
prepared to assert their rights.
The army of the usurper, his train
ed bands of metropolitans, attack
ed them with artillery and infant
ry, and after a conflict, short and
decisive, the people were victori
ous. The metropolitan army was
completely routed and dispersed;
and ou Tuesday, the State-House,
arsenals, and all the public build
ings and property were abandon
ed, and were taken into possession
by the rightful Government of the
State.
From that day until this, perfect
peace, order and quiet prevailed in
the city of New Orleans, and no
crime has been committed, no vio
lence, uo injury has been done to
person or property, and joy and
confidence tilled all hearts.
On Tuesday the proclamation of
the President was issued, and ou
Wednesday telegrams were reeeiv
ed, clearly indicating the determin
ation ot the Administration to put
dowu this Government with its
strong hand. On Wednesday even
ing Gen. W. H. Emory, command
ing the Department of the Gulf, ar
rived in New Otleaus, and coinmu
nicated to us his jiereinptory orders
to compel immediate compliance
with the proclamation of the Presi
dent of 15th September.
In a conference to which he invi
ted ns, and in which we were as
sisted by several gentlemen who
were also invited to participate at
the General's rooms last night, be
informed us that he was not per
mitted to recognize our Govern
ment ih any way, and that immedi
ate submission and a surrender of
the property of the State to tbe
United States would be tbe only
I
means of avoiding the employment
of the military and naval force of
the United States to compel obedi
ence.
At our earnest eolidtation we ob
tained a delay until 1 o'clock to-day,
which was at our request, this
morning, extended to 3, to confer
with leading citizens.
After full conference, finding that
further delay would not be grouted,
and that war with the United
States wonld be the inevitable re
sult ot refusal on our part, we were
compelled to acoede to the terms
proposed, and we have abandoned
the State property, which was iu
our possession, to tbe United States
alone.
We need not remind yon, tellow
citizens, that at every stage of our
protracted conflict with this usur
pation, we have constantly assert
ed, and maintained our assertion,
that we have never intended to
come in conflict with the authority
of the forces of the United States;
and when that has been the alter
native, we have not hesitated to
yield ready obedience to that au
thority.
Simultaneous with this will be
published tbe protest which we
made to Gen. Emory against this
action of the Federal Government,
which displaces your rightful Gov
eruor and Lieuteuant Governor
and which places tbe State in the
possession and under the control of
tbe military forces of the United
States.
Thus, fellow-citizens, has the
State of Louisiana been finally
stricken down by the hand of pow
er, and we are uo longer citizens of
a State, but are inhabitants uierely
of what was once a free State, the
peer of auy other in the Americau
galaxy.
It is no disgrace to submit to
power which we have not the cap
acity nor the right to resist. It
is painful to be compelled to give
up our most cherished rights ;
lint we do so with tbe fnll determ
ination to regain tbem, and to
have them restored by the had by
which we have been deprived of
them.
It only remaing for us to urge up
on you to summon to your aid all
to j yoiir courge and fortitude, your vir
I "tue and forbearance, to enable you
! to submit with becoming dignity to
this great calamity, which no act of
ours or of yours could have averted.
Continue to be as you bava been,
law abiding and faithful to your du
ty and obligations to the Govern
ment of the United States. You
have just gained a great victory
over your enemy arrayed in arms
against you. Make one more sub
lime effort, and gain a grand victo
ry—a victory over your passions
and inclinations. Yield faithful,
ready obedience to all legally con
stituted authority, and be assured
that the stoty of your wrongs, your
hmg forbearance, your heroic vir
tues, displayed as well in your hour
ottriumpsas in your misfortunes,
will command and receive the eym
pathy and respect of the civilized
world.

the restoration.
.Some time before 10 o'clock Saturday
morning, Kellojjg's private carriage and
driver were observed standing in front of
the St.. Louis Hotel or State House. A
crowd of about 500 persons, all negroes
with two exceptions, took up their position
on the opposite banquette and stared at
the gallery of the State House, where a
score or so of U. S. soldiers lounged slowly
up and down, apparently totally uninter
ested. t
Close inquiry of these negroes showed
that they had been standing there for sev
eral liouts, and that they bad not seen
Kellogg's carriage drive up; indeed that
his car. iage was observed there when they
tiret arrived.
No one in all the neighborhood bad seen
either carriage or Kellogg arrive. Yet the
guard :tt. tbe door gave the information
that Kellogg sftid Clarke were up stairs in
conversation with Gen. Brooke. Admit
tance was refused to every one. No Radi
cal chief, however consequential, was ad
mitted to the State House ; reporters were
excluded by a special order.
Kellogg's action will, therefore, only be
come known when he tells it himself.—
Fi oui the soldiers, however, it is gathered
that Kellogg stepped into the Executive
chamber unaccompanied by any friends,
and in the presence ofG'*n Brooke seated
himself in the gubernatorial chair. This,
and this'mly, was his reinstallation so im
periously ordered from Washington. There
was no music, no cheers. The negroes op
posite appeared congregated there more
from curiosity than joy or demonstration.
Kellogg's friends claim that he rode
through the city in ai| open carriage and
unaccompanied. This is probably true, al
though no one saw him do it.
About 11 o'clock the crowd of negroes on
the street became so large that it stopped
all business. A squad of the new police
was sent down from the Third Station and
succeeded i u routing all idlers.
A t half past ] 1 Kellogg was still in the

At the 8'imp time that Kellogg slipped
into the Executive chamber, Clinton, who
has, up to date, been residing iu tbe Cus

the State Auditor, iu the Statd House. This
was done without any great deuionstra*
tiou. Mr. Clinton reported tbe office as
being in perfect order, and just as be left

changed; apparently uo business bad been

The court was opened Saturday morn

From 10 o'clock until half-past 11 tbe
crowd around the entrance of police bead

the latter hour Carondelet street, for an
entire square, was througed with a con
course of between 1500 and 2000 persons,
Some wore looks of bitter disappointment,
some deeply cursed tbe last degradation
that was evidently in store for the true

At i 1:30 A. M., Major P. Boyle walked
into the Superintendent's office and report
ed that lie had "orders from Gov. Kellogg
to take possession of the place." Several
other of the principal member.« of the old
Police Board and the metropolitan force
accompanied Major Boyle.
Tbe officers in charge at headquarters
signified their willingness to give up the
place, but requested those demanding to
wait till Mr. Boylan returned, so that the
affair might bo formally executed.
The troops were drawn up and prepared
to be moved ont on a moment's notice.—
Many of those connected with the new po.

returned officials, and at 12 M. to-day po

stations, was again in the dominion of
Kellogg, and New Orleans was placed once
more under the power of the metropolitan
police.
finale.
The resnlt of the conference mentioned,
between Mr. Boylan, Chief of Police, and
Col. Brooke, Military Governor, was that
the Chief was ordered by the commandant
to comply with tbe demands that. Kellogg
should make in reference to the police
buildings.
Chief Hoylan returned to his headquar
ters at 12:20, when Baldey, newly appoint
ed Chief of Police, by Kellogg presented a
formal demand for the surrender of police
headquarters With this demand Boylan
complied and then withdrew, leaving the
metropolitan force in possession.
STATIC HOUSE STILL GARRISONED.
Although Baldley soon collected some
250 policemen, yet apparently these iliil
not quiet the minds of the Radicals. The
police were congregated at the station as
in days of yore, as if to piorect each other.
Tbo State House was deserted by Kel
logg about 1 o'clock and immediately shut
up, closed and barred and bolted, as if it
were a fortress As far as can be seen—
there is not a living soul in the building
save a company of U. S. soldiers, who are
locked in as if they were anxious to escape
from the ill fated walls of the State-House.
It was thought that when Gen. Brooke
left he wonld take his soldiers with him ;
but it is now understood that they will
remain as guards to Kellogg for some time
to come, although the latter still resides
at the Custom-House.
During Kellogg's installation visit to tbe
State-House that building was guarded
and protected from the gangs of negroes
opposite by the Boylan police.
