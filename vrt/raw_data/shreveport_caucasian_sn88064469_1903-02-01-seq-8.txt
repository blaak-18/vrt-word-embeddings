IOBEtT E. LEE
In Statuary Hall at the Capitol Beside
George Washington.
A spccial to the Memphis Conmmercial
Appeal dated Washington. January 27,
Virginia's proposition to place a statue,
of General Robert E. Lee in Statuary
Hall at the capitol beside that of George
Washington, has been discussed in
SWashington for the past few weeks.
There have been many expressions fav
orable and adverse to the proposed plan.
Interviews today with leading Repub
licans in Congress lead to the belief that
if Virginia decides to honor the mem
ory of Lee by placing a statue of the
I distinguished soldier in Statuary Hall,
Congress will not object.
Of all the Northern men who have
been seen, Senator Depew of New York
is the most hearty in his expression of
favor to the acceptance of the statue.
Many say privately they would not op
pose it. but Senator Depew does not
mince words. The following is his state
ment: "My opinion on this subject is
very clear. The war between the North
and the South was fought for the prey
servation of the Union. This question
has been discussed in debate by the two
sides ever since the framing of the arti
cles of the confederation. The Union
side won. The issue was accepted at
once by the defeated side, and I think
the placing of a statue of General Rob
ert E. Lee in Statuary Hall would be
an emphatic recognition of the fact that
we are all now advocates of nationality
and its perpetuity. I am heartily in favor
of the Lee statue."
Senator Beveridge said when asked
for his views in regard to the accept
ance of the Lee statue: "Owing to my
being occupied with the statehood bill I
have not had time to give this matter
careful consideration, and I should like
to go into it thoroughly before giving
an opinion. lan' inclined to think, how
ever, that i would favor receiving the
statiue."
.Rpresentative Crtmpacker of In
diap~ opte of the leading Republicans in
the flottse, and who has been trying for
yg"rsto have passed a measure looking
to the reducttdh 'of the representation of
.the $l o h in Congress, is another who
L uqes out m~arely with _the statement
iie woud n~t oppose the. broposed
I ssy opinion," said Judge Crum
"the settlalmet of this question
'ld be leftt etirely to Virginia. Rob

MARRIED
Miss L. Edith Davis a:1l Mr. F. \V.
Ballauf.
tOn \Vclneday morning at 8 o'clock
.lis, L. Edith D)avi and Mr. F. W.
Ballauf were married by Rev. Father
Scharl at the home of Mr. C. C. Chesh
ire. No. 217 Fannin sireet, in the pres
ence of a gathering of friends. Mr. R.
Baliauf. father of the groto, aln$ his
wife and daughter. Mliss 7lamie Bal
lauf. of Jefferson. Tex.. were among the
attendants.
The bride is a charming and accom'
plished young lady, a favorite with her
friends in Shreveport. The groom is en
gaged in business in Eufanla. I. T.. and
i, hehl in the highest est esteem.
We join their many friends in hearty
felicitations.
FAITHFUL DAD.
We happened in a home the other
night and over the parlor dxoor saw the
legend worked in letters of red: "VWhat
is home without a mother." Across the
room was another brief "God bless our
home."
Now, what's the matter with "God
bless our dad"? He gets up early, lights
the fire, boils an ýgg, 'grabs his dinner
pail and wipes off the dew of the dawn
with his boots while many a mother is
sleeping. He makes the weekly handout
for the butcher, the grocer, the milk
man and baker, and his little pile is bad
ly worn before he has been home an
hour. He stands off the bailiff and keeps
the rent paid up.
If there is a noise during the night
dad is kicked in the back and made to
go downstairs to find the burglar and
kill him. Mother darns the socks, but
dad bought the socks in the first place
aind the needles and the yarn afterward.
Mother does upp the fruit; well, dad
bought it all, and jars and sugar cost
like the, mischief.
Dad buys chickens for the Sunday
dinner, carves them himself and draws
the neck from the ruins after every one
else. is served. "What is home without
a mother ?" Yes, tlit is all right; but
what is home without a father? Ten
chances to one it is a boarding house,
father is under a slab and the landlady
is the widow. Dad, here's to you;
you've got your fault--you may have
lots of 'em--but you're all right, and we
will miss you when you're gone.
