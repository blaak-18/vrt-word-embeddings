HairVigor
For reetinga to Gray Halr its
natu l Vitallt and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once agreea
ble, healthy,
and effectual
for preserv
ing the hair.
It soon r~e.
stores faded
or gray hair
to its original
color, wit h the gloss and fresi' ess of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, fall
ing hair checked, and baldness often,
though not always, cured by its
usee. Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saLved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity,,so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the 'air wit. a pasty sediment, it
wit seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or falling of',
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff, which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which make some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, bhit
not harm it. If wanted merely fti
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing lse,
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet Insts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.
