If the go11uiig Iolti'i:tui and It t'
goltih journ:,l. could lhav'e been
cliininate( I from the D)emocratic
party after the ('hina,oi convention
llryan's victory wv bt tl have been
easy and sur'e.
But we do not agree with the
Times-l)emocrat abut the results
of fusion in this State. It claims
that "tusion" will lead to the return
of the Populists to the Democratic
fold. This is a mistake. The
Times-I )emocrat's congratulations
are out ot order. The Populists
have no intention to sever their
party affiliations. 'lThey will never
surrender their convictions nor
their political freedom to the Dem
ocratic machine. The result will
be the reverse. The Populists,
seeing that their principles are
gaining sway, will be firmer than
ever in their party organization.
They will not have any inducement
to go over to a rapidly dying and
disintegrating party. They will
stand fast. While, on the other
hand, the true free silver Demo
crats will join the Populists by
the thousands. They will not be
sdtisfied with half a dose of popu
lism. Their experience in this
campaign will prove to those Dem
ocrats that the Populists are their
truest natural allies-that the Pop
ulists have always been right and
have led in the fight for reform,
teaching the people and educating
the Democrats on all measures of
reform, These free silver Demo
crats will see their own party
rent and torn by dissention and
selfish discord. Why should they
seek refuge in the haven of Popu
lism, Why should they cling to
the sinking wreck of the old party
which has been scuttled by politi
cal freebooters .
No. The Times-Democrat is
woefully in error. After this elec
tion, the I)emocratic party will '
pass out of sight as a factor in
national politics. The gohlldug
Democrats will join the Republi
cans, The free silver Democrats
will be absorbedl by the People's
party which will shape and control
the destinies of this government
for a generation to come.-Mon
roe Bulletin.
The Camppau .
Seeing that they could not carry
the State alone, the Democrats,
through their emergency commit
tee, persuaded the Populist special
committee to fuse with them. So
the fusion was made at Baton Rouge
on the 24th of September on the
basis of four Populist electors and
four popocratic electors. Surely
this fusion, made solely to elect
Bryan, estops the popocrats from
charging the populists with being
for McKinley. The Populists will
carry out the fusion to the letter.
If it fails the odium must reston
the Democrats. We are sorry to
hear that many of them declare
that they will not vote for the
Populist electors. If this is done,
the fusion will weaken Bryan.
An important fact of the fusion
was a pledge of a fair election and
the Democratic committee agreed
to se its inluence to have a watch
er an- commissioner representing
the Populists appointed st- each
polling precinct in this and the 4th
districts. If this pledge is not
arned out to the letter by the so
pervijera in every parish, pleasee

The Board of Supervisors for <
this parish met last Saturday and
appointed coummissioners, clerks
and watchers for the approaching
election. t
They observed the letter and the t
spirit of the late fusion agreement
by appointing one commissioner
and one watcher at each poll in the
parish as handed in by the Popu
list committee.
This gurantees a fair election in
this parish, and if carried out
over the district, the two parties
will feel better and the people of t
the district be nearer united than
they have been for many years. t

The base slanderers who charg
ed that the Populists had sold out
to Mark Hanna are confounded by
the fusion to elect Bryan. But (
they will not takethe slander back,
but invent some other falsehood to
take its place.-Monroe Bulletin.
If you haven't paid your sub- I
crnption it's your fault, not ours.

thei starting of Pop)ulist
Clubs in every precinct iii the
State. No organlizers iue necessa

county organizers may be appoint
ed. But in the main thie peolple
should organize for themselves.
These clubs are to be open, arc to
hold weekly meetings during" the

as they see fit. They aire to report
the unaes oftheir oflieers (C:hair

together with a nomina;l charter lie

Committee will in turn fiorward a
charter and enroll the club as a
member of the National Associa

These clubs are to have public dis

are to do quiet work, to make con

to State or National Committees
other thanI voluntary contributions,
except the charter fee, which is to
be turned at once over into the Na

All present organizations, such
as legions, alliances, Si.v\er clubs,

He says this fund aggregating
