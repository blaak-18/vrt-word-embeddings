FRIDAY, JUNE 14, 1+95.
Five thotauIal IHople listened
to Congressman W. J. Brian in
New Orleans, and they say he is
the greatest living orator in Anmeri

week that he is a hero.

People's Party Paper.
The great silver convention in
New Orleans on the 10th inst.,
was attended by delegates from
nearly every parish in the State,
and every ward in the city, save
two, and over five thousanl Ipeo
pie heard the brilliant speeches of
Congressmen Bryan of Nebraska,
and Money of Mississippi.
Ashton Phelps, editor of the
great Times-Democrat, was made
chairman of the meeting, with
Henry L. Garland Fsq., secretary.
The following able committee
was the author of the clear cut,
expressive and unequivocally 16 to
1 resolutions which we have no
room to print this week : Senator
G. W. Montgomery, Judge A. A. I
Gunby, J. W. Lalouisse, Con
giresman H. W. Ogden. Senator
J. C. Pugh, Gen. Jas. HI. Cos
grove, Secretary of State T. S.

Mayor John Fitzpatrick and City
Attorney E. A. O'Sullivan. I
Tbieconventioni was an immense i
ancoeus in every particular, and far I
exceeded the hopes of its most san- i
tino supporters. We shall have
Iore to say of it next week, as
well as a full account of the Mem

l'raternal greeting :
The tine is. aiit r'achiiig when
the duty in~il.S4l Iby our constitu
tion, reqllire Ithat you shouldli elect
delh._"atces to youlr State Alliance,
wiliirh cinvenes . at StLhrovelrt on
'l'huiirsday, Auiigust 1, 1 .:S. In
the selection of delegati s wet should
iniil in niind, that ouir orgUtliiZi
i inl Vhille intensely political is uine
'uliiVticNll y lnon-plltrt izi. There
folke, in ch(sillng declegates to your
Stat( Alliaince, dtio not forget, t hat,
other Iihinr 1 niing equal, the alboive
qiui:litiehtoilns llare necessary to the
I'i't reir'elntatl:ive of your order.
.lAndl, while we all may have our111'
iarty pre.ferences, let uis r'tieli
I.r thait whlien we einter an Alliance
hlIi,,, or oilr State council, we
sholid leave our party-co:lt :at
holme. Our order is essoutially olp
ls sed to the titter antagonimslis of
lpart, anainst which Wiashingiton
wairnetl his coullntrymen, aindti which
has Inln the prime 'cause of our
plast Natio:nal iiisfortune alnd af
flictions, anui has lla the fouindai
ttili for iprobablhly greater troubt'les
in thei future.
The cuning iieeting at Shreve
port is an iiiplortant one, in view
of the ipolitic:il situltion both State
and National. In National politics
the assuli is well deftined and in line
with the Oclll I)enliands on the
curr:ency question. For years the
Alliance has Ibn endeavoring to
iush this (questini to to the front, and
has orne all sorts of contumely
and harsh epithets as the "calamity
howlers," "cranks, anarchists,
&c." At last we stand in the pries
once of this great issue, and by
universal demand of the people it
must he settled. It has tiiken Ipre
codence of all other questions and
the people will not be contented
until it has been satisfactorily solv
ed. In this great controversy the
Farmers' Alliance have sown tihe
seed-they have germinated and
are hearing fruit and the harvest
nmust follow. Currency is the vi
talizing principle of the bodly po
litic, social and commercial, as
blood is the essential motor of the
physical being. A healthy condi
tion in xboth, is necessary to pre
vent stagnation and death. Let
every Alliance membler, therefore,
buckle on his armor and prepare
for the battle of the giants, and as
you go into light remember that
the issuE as well as the BATrrLE
tIELD are of your own choosing,
and the gage of battle is joined.
In state politics another ques
tion scarce second in importance
awaits you. Shall your will as ex
pressed by your vote deposited in
the ballot-box be given vitality in
legislation, or will you be satisfied
with the empty bauble of the fran
chise, while the vitalizing princi
ple remains in the hands of the
corruptionist and the monied cor
Ioration? You must have "an
honest ballot and a fair count" in
fact as well as in name or your
ideal government "of the people,
Iby the people and for the pleople"
is a delusion and a sham. To-day
you are deprived of your ballot
by FRAUD, to-morrow it will be by
roacE. You must prevent both
or the very essence of free gov
ernment will have escaped from
your grasp, and you will be verita
ble slaves.
In the contest that is upon us,
both State amnl National the love of
country should dominate the love
of party. Let PRINCIPLE be your
sheet-anchor--throw POLICY to the
windtl. In the disintregation of
arties to-day we have an object
of the effects of party poli
cy, which means party intriigue
that has been the motor of their
action. Letthelove of home and
fireside take plrecedence over love
of spdoils and pelf, and an advance
in the right direction will bhave
been made. A reform currency
and a reformed ballot are abeolute
ly necessary to your prosperity
and freedom. Therefore, lay asde
your-party trappings for the once
and go with your fellow citizens,
who favor ballot-reform and cur
reacy reform ha·nl in hand without
regardl to party preferences or af-.
fliationa. These are the burning
iesses at this time. Until your
vote is counted, sad returned, as
deposited, you will remain the vie
tam of the corrupt politician and
the slave of the monied corpora

We are 1ll'eased to notice the bI
fea:rles and unfaltering stand which i
the Iist and miost honest papers of la
our State have taken in Iehalf of P
ballot reformi. It shows a strong p1
moral as well as political courage it
on their part. I lhwet er they are
only ladvocating the sentimient of at
all the lionest Ipeople, whlio will nev- a
r rlest satisfied until they can have ci
a fair chalice to vote as they wish, nI
and then have the sweet satisfac- fit
tion of knowing that vote will ex- to
plress just what they intended it to. w
Newspapers nmay hie the great lxo
litical moralizers as well as edulci- of
tors, of our land if they only will. w
L[et ius kcep the good work ulp Iln- c
til we are free from this inglorious ti,
iolitical corruption, which has been w,
a conlstant mllenace to our political l8
liberty. st
Our past election records have at
been :a stingin disgrace to ou11r i
beautiful State, and they mnake si
every honest citizen, who loves his la
country, blush with shame every in
time he has them pointed out to th
him. Again we say-let every pa- of
wr keep pmuring red hot shells in- ea
to the camp of corruption until Ix
we have achieved a glorious victo- cel
ry. We, as expounders of truth is
and defenders of liberty, are not le:
only expected to fight this cause, n
but are politically and morally ob
ligated to (do so to redeem our fair
connionwealth from the lark blots E,
that have tainted the pages of her
Ipast history. Let this be a fight
to a tinish without the slighest tle- i
gree of a colmpronmise. Let usch
plant our banner of reform on the
ra:lmparts and keep them there. Vic- ad
tory is ours if we only struggle
for it. th
Every Editor who has the best of
interests of his State at heart, ,'
should exert all his power and in- of
tlllence to aecolmplish this victory.
Our financial as well as political, th
prosperity is at stake in this isse. in
If we wish to become recognized th
as an honest, entcrprising people C.
we will have to prove our integri
ty and iprogressiveness by what we th
say and accomplish. Now is the
most opportune time for action.- re

The Populists last fall elected a
l1maln by the name of Maple to Ie thu
treasurer of the county in which an
the city of Seattle is situated. Ma- the
ple was nothing but an illiterate cr:
"hayseed" and was anything but a tic
"dlude" in personal appearance.
The Republicans made a hitter Hi
fight against him and pitched into
him in the most shockirg manner, ti
but a wicked and plrverse genera- vit
tion of l'opulistic anarchists stood m(
vy him, and he was elected. Then to
the Republican gang undertook to as
leat him on an election contest but
they failed; then they raised the fol
bhnds ,on him to ISK),(NN) ald he
hbad troublle in securing luomnlsmen, all
but finally when th,, entire Polpulist Pa
vote ,f Seattlo startedl in to sign I0
his bond the gang weakened anld, cl
after several months of delay, his AI
ind was allpproved and he went
into ofllice. ou
And now the trouble began. He sul
removed the deposits fromI the fat- Wi
vored Ibanks which had been in the Lo
habit of handling the public funds, boi
naking themn count out the publlic rol
moneys in gold coin, and took ica
charge of them himself, as was
pluaoly his iduty. This was highly re
revolutionary, and bordered close- the
ly on narcy, but Treasurer Ma- a
plie escald lynching, and so far has 1
not iben inmpeached and removed on

But we fear Treasurer Maple's Iu
conduct of a week ago Friday has s5o0
cookedl his goose, for he was guilty the
of the most flagrant act of anarchy lut
known in the annals of Seattle. ad
This is what occurred, as we learn
from the Seattle Call, a Populist and
organ, whose confessions, there- rol
fore, cannot be controverted by me
the Populists of Seattle and the
State of Washington: '"On that W
day the school teachers of Seattle,
140 in number, walked up to the
cashier's window in the county 1
treasurer's ofice," presented their cou
warrants for saarioes and were seli
paid in gold amd fractional silver Ilans
the face value thereof! Before the the
ilvent of this creature Maple into hin
aeice it had been a time-honored
ostom of the treasurers to intorm by
the school teachers that "there was
o cash in the treasury" to meet
whir arrants, and then some ,il
ohlliag and gemerous fiascier who p" (
had the treasurer'a money in his Bus

said in extenuation of Maple's
lawless conduct; he is not "up"'
in finance, and is not "sound" on
the currency question, but still his
outrageous behavior is a horrible
exa:mphle of what Ipople may ex

elect Populists to office. His case
is both a warning and a ilesson: a

Cash vs. Coin.
This is the title of a hook by
S.JTudn Edward Wisner, which pro
fesses to he a reply to Coin's Fi
nancial School. Te tenor of thei
Iok indicates that Cash considers
a it a complete refutation of the
statements and reasoning of the
young financier, when, in fact, it
leaves his strongest prolpositions
unassailed, and when an attack is
made, it is by a flank movenlent
with masked batteries. Ilere re
ia few samples: When Coin an
swers in the affirmative the quels
e tion, "Do you think it possible to
have two standards for the sanme
It use?" Cash answers him with this
I crusher, "Well, then, you prolpose
a creation. There never has been
n such a thing. To my mind the
1 proposition involves a contradic
Y tion." Cash does not tell us wheth
er he considers this argument or
r asseveration. In another place
' Cash states "Legal tender laws are
' one of the means by which the
Sgovernment becomes a party to
private robbery," and he cites the
case of A. T. Stewart who contrct
e ed with a quaryman for stone for I
his splendid residence and paid him
in "legal tender" paper money,
thus swindling the quarryman out
of thousands of dollars. lie neg
lected to say how much greater
would have been the swindle if the
n money had not been legal tender.
Certainly the legal tender charac
ter of the paper did not make it I
I less valuable. In this Cash's logic
is as bad as his grammar. \W'e
have read this book with some care,
s and feel free to state that Coin's 1
Financial School will continue to
_graduate free-coinage voters, and
to endanger the position of the
golt standard advocates, unless
some heavier metal than Cash is
brought to hear upon the institu
tion.--Texas Farm and Ranch.
