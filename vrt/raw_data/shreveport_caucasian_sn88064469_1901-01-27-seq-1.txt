A Few Suggestions Offered in
the Interest of All
Concerned.
The telephone is an instrumenu
through which the ever.as:Ing jays
of the bereafter or the perdition tor
ever, msy he accelerated to a wou
derfet degree.
Be pa lent
Apprmach !he instrument geut'y
Do n,: rinc, rinu, ring, as if th:
houss was on ire and voA desired to
summus the fire dtpsrtmeut, be.
ring clearly.
Do not grab the handle of the
ttauemitter as if it was abouw ".o-get
sway-trom-vou."
Seise it, as If it were a sixteen or
eighteen-year-old blushing sugar
lump, upon whom you propose to
coiseutrate your best eft rts.
Do not try to talk while chewing
gum, or tooacco, or holding a ciga
between your teeth.
Do not talk in a tone of voice
which would indicate that all the
world is deaf and dumb . u: you.
The esential, the a5solate, (in a
singular tease) is the Abgel at thb.
Central (all angels), don't forg -t tha
.vow, do not supprse that the auger
who is the intermediary aetween
you and the person to whom you
would speak will not appreciate
kindues and generous wor:s. And,
uo not forget that, unaess you act
ktid and considerate some day ( vnu.
you will wish to enga;e iu a s ee
1:tie divertisemueu: with your 1, it
erl,'-:he knows y ur voice- b
ang , till m ke you feel joyful wiu
the answ r to your ring ".hey':r

Now, be good; do not siy (id if
you are pious) tiiuk naugthy wer i,

Sheril's Offiee: "562, therifi's office

Sherifi's Office : "J am Brown

Hera Smith and Brown are imme
diately placed is connection, they
are introduced, as it were lu an in
swant, and fsel free to speak on toe
matter they would coisider and for
which daith has called Brown.
A moment's re&ection wili impress
this fact on the Intelligent mind th.t
it is essential that each person as
each end of the telephone shod d.bs
made acquainted with each other
before they may engage in a to k over
business or any matter wharsuev ei.

A eumber of gentleman anti-toll
bridge men-held a couference yee
terday, at which was considered the
questlou of collecting tolls for eros -
ing the railroad bridge. By a special
act of the Legislature, an elegion
may be ordered, at which may be
determined whether the bridge sball
be free, or be~for revenue or for suf
ficient tolls for the maintenance of
the bridge. Tbp Cancasia't has a rec
oit(; it was for free fU rries and fr:e
brtugcs when it stood aimost alone
aud waE ridiculed, audit stands today
as it did years ago f~r free ferries and
free bri twee. Why should tolls be
exacted from any man wtio would
