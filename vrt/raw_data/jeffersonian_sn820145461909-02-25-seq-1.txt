absorption of the Tennessee Coal,
Iron & Railway Company by the U.
S. Steel Company, and that Attorney
General Bonaparte will be strongly
cited to his duty to proceed against
the trust for its violation of the Sher
man law. It will be remembered that
when -Messrs. Gary and Frick called
upon the President prior to this mer
ger, 'they placed themselves in the at
titude of philanthropists who were
willing to abate the panic by going to
the rescue of a certain then unnamed
concern in New York, which would
be wrecked unless they did so, and in
whose ruin many other interests would
be involved. It seems strange that
this half confidence should have been
offered, and stranger still that it was
accepted and that Mr. Roosevelt al
lowed himself to be led into the
scheme to such an extent that he
practically ordered the Attorney Gen
eral to ignore the violation of the
law, in view of the benevolent (?)
motive. All the details have been dis
cussed in The Jeffersonian, but for
some time the investigation lagged
and fribbled away the time on mere
technical objections, remote from the
actual issue. Now it appears they are
going, to get down to business and, if
so, the Steel Trust may possibly learn
that the executive does not constitute
the only authority in the land.

that a special message will follow, go
ing more into detail. Much, it is to
be hoped that this can be done. The
sale of the lake years ago to private
owners has already dost the state
blood and suffering and left upon the
commonwealth a stain which years
will not remove. It is not too late to
repair some of the error and to dem

highways, which means the advance

keting crops, in social intercourse, in
much that goes to make up a pros
perous, comfortable country life. From
a report just published, it appears
that there are now in operation in the
Southern States alone almost ten
thousand rural routes, or about 24 per
cent of the total number of routes in
operation, which cover 237,469 miles
of roads. These routes, which cost
the government a total of $8,549,218
per anirom to maintain, are divided
among the states as follows: Ala
bama, 879; Arkansas, 344; Florida,
140; Georgia, 1,533; Louisiana, 115;
Mississippi, 625; North Carolina, 1,-
245; South Carolina, 709; Tennessee,
1,571; Texas, 1,745, and Virginia, 950.
In these states rural delivery has been
organized on a full county basis, in
eighty-nine counties, and is contem
plated in other counties as soon as it
can be arranged.
The lowest estimate of the people
served by the R. F. D. is 18,000,000.
This is but the beginning. There is
every hope of getting a Parcels Post
bill through congress at no distant
day, which will be merely an exten
sion of the benefits of the mail serv
ice, economizing the cost to the gov
ernment and vastly aiding the people.
With Platte out of the Senate the
greatest foe to the Parcels Post will
be eliminated, and it is known that
Elihu Roo£ strongly favors the meas
ure. For all the service we now en
joy—and the incalculable benefits to
come in future years, we are indebted
to Thos.-E. Watson.

of course means increased taxation in
some form), Representative Landis
bobs up with a bill providing for an
appropriation of $250,000 for a “sum

thereafter at the people’s cost for the
enjoyment of the Chief Executive.
Although Mr. Taft will cost the coun
try about $300,000 to maintain, the
boot-licking element is still further
anxious to bring on more gifts at
the expense of the public. It is to be
hoped that he will be sane enough to
veto this onslaught of gush and set
a needed precedent in retrenchment.
Otherwise, it would seem we are worse
off than the subjects of monarchies.

empire takes a dizzy
whirl and the waiting
world wonders where it
will round up, and tells itself that a
“crisis” has been reached. After an
entirely successful coup, in which the
Sultan was gently retired to the rear
and asked to be seated, a Parliament
was called, which embraced nearly ev
ery kind of nationality that cosmo
politan section afforded and just how
the motley throng would agree among
themselves was seriously debated by
the spectators. However, it did fair
ly well, and lately it deposed the
grand vizier in manner summary and
satisfactory. Altogether, things look
very hopeful. When it is remembered
that the party of reform has been
many years in progress and its suc
cess was due to careful planning and
complete harmonization of the civil
and military forces, each “crisis”
that must arise need not necessarily
endanger the Young Turks. They are
now held together by the bond of pure
patriotism. The danger will come la

inevitable corruption creeps in. At

been the man who first
pointed out to Mr. Taft, Mr. Knox
and the other leading limbs of the
law the fact that Philander C. Knox
was ineligible to the position of Secre
tary of .State, under the fundamental
provision of paragraph 2, section VI,
first article of that almost obsolete—
certainly very musty, rusty document,
hie U. S. Constitution, which prevents
a Senator from taking any office which
he voted to create, or in which he
voted to have the salary increased.
Philander C. Knox had voted to
increase the pay of the Secretary
of State and so was in a predicament.
However, the house of representatives
kindly passed a law excepting the of
fice of Secretary of State from the
provisions of the law which in 1907
increased the salary of all the cabi
net officers. Wherefore, Mr. Knox
may now accept the appointment, at
diminished pay, and, in the language
of Mr. Taft, save the public from “a
distinct misfortune” and himself from
“inexpressibly great disappointment.”
But the blunder, so amiably and clum
sily repaired, does not speak over
well for the qualifications •of Mr.
Knox for the position. Perhaps, how
ever, it may lead him to read over the
Constitution again, which he doubt
less scanned, together with the Decla
ration of Independence, during his
boyhood’s happy days. We assure
him, as per book review parlance, that
it will “repay a careful perusal.”
