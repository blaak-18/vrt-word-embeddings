AN AMtEICAN HOItSKWOM(AN IN THE CAM
?AGNA.
I had seen Contessa Brunetti take a
high wall made of jagged rocks I
thought I would not say anything at all
for the time being. I trotted along
that wall a piece until I found a spot
where it was cons;derably lower, and I
leaped that with my eyes shut. Su hb
reckless riding I never saw in my life.
It is only to ,e equaled by the beauty
and swell habits of the women.
The flower of Roman society was
there. the Duchessa Grazioli. Marchlsa
ltoccaglovine. Prince ('olonna, Duca
Cesarini, Comte ('ampbello and rn=n.y
others. As for the young. dasl.c:
army officers. they ride with an c:.se
calculated to make one believe ti.cy
are centaurs. I never expected to t.:l
such rough ground as that in c!\i!icL3,
overpopulated Italy. such rocks. ,. a
'tangle of briers and weedls anl. a! ve
all. such stone walls. This motr:::: I "
trotted out into the ope.n courtl: v.
followed by my groom, and f,,l ::a
hour I practiced on a couple of I..::"
ticularly hard fenccs. I saw John ttrun
pale onlce or twice. I fancy he ex! t
ed to carry me home in a ghastly :::.
mangled condition. Anyway. I we:'t
have it said that I cannot ride as ~ .ll I
as those delicate Italian women. I
have a trick of shutting my eyes when
I am going over a very high wall :iuch
1 feel a little nervous. .I think Calptain
Sperati, with whom I was riding, no
ticed it once or twice. and it hurt my
pride awfully. Well, we shall see to
morrow if I can't do any better.
The weather is grand, just the right
kind for this sport. Nearly every morn
nlg we ride out. 1 am sorry we did not
conime here before Instead of lingering
so long In Corfu. Why, do you know,
the hunting season begins In Novem
ber, about the 15th, and ends only in
March! Ahb, this is life and keen en
joyment! The funny part of it Is that
the common people seem to take as
great a delight in It as we do. They
assemble in crowds at the meeting
place. It is almost at Tre Fontane. or
at the tomb of Cecella Metella, andl
there they stand watching us with all
their might. I sometimes have a sus
piclon that they cherish the unholy
hope that some one of us may full off
our horses. but they shan't see me. at
any rate. I have purchased a new
horse, a fiddle headed, rawboned old
Irish mare, who knows the country.
She Isn't handsome, like dear cld IRex.
but fancy poor ltex trying to pick his
way over such ground as this!
Mrs. Leland.doesn't approve of my
performances at all. She says she thinks
the whole thing Is very foolhardy.
She reminds me of the fate of l rs.
Whitney every time I start to go out.
However, her words don't afrfect me
In the least. There are several Ameri
can girls here, and they tell me it's
just the place to pick up an Italian
duke or marquis. Sh '1 I do it and
forget Dick at home? (\Well, it all de
pends on the msrqu s. There are
really some charming specimetns hern.
lut you will think me frivolons. anud

A Ceotly ES.erlment.
An enterprising Austrulian million
aire named Leonard took a trip to i'v
ro some years ago. He saw great flocka
of the alpaca wandering on the And,,s.
Being a woolgrower himself, he was
struck with their splendid fleece. He
resoLved to buy some and take them
bome. He foind that the Perurian
government absolutely prohibited their
export. He tried, by chartering a ape
eual ship. to smuggle some off, but was
unsuccea.fuL Then the idea occurred
to him of taking them out of the coun
try eastward. He bought a large flock,
engaged trusty men and had the crea
tures driven over the passes. 18,000
fet above sea level. and then clean
acr.s. the continent to Buenos Ayre,.
E'ble little expedidon cost him $11,000.
But the g march bad so weakened

signify that we are not yet out of tie

are decorated with six and Seven

lace sewed on in1 form of anloth( r

much longer thaln 1the silk and cotton

wish, and nothing tri:us undergar

broiderles are almost as fine as lace,
sand in a few ease's I have seR0c. a pretty
pattern of embroidery edged with t
narrow rufle of Iace. The .Japanese
kimono is among the very prettiest o.
the negligces, and it is made lung or
short, but instead of having the aleeves
like those worn by the dainty little
Japanese women they mnake long ow
iug ones. Some of the white dressing
sacks have wide satiehr colilais, tritnmtmed
with all the lace that could be made to
hold ou. They are V shapnl at the neck.
The nightdresses are various, andl
yet the prevailing style is suggestive of
the lirst .empire. They h:ave yokes.

lace and ribbons. Some have pompa

C'hemises, which have htn lon g: ltid

garments of the new year's output are
the chemises.
One unusually pretty negligee is
made of white Japanese washable silk

has a short Mother IIublbard yuke. and

This is trimmed, as are the sleeves and
