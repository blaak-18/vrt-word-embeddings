The Only Danger.
The earnestness and enthuosiasm of
the people of this section of Louisiana
in organizing for the rescue of the I
State from the hands of the corrupt
men who have so nearly ruined it, has
had no parallel since the era of seces
sion. It bears,,in fact, much resem-i
blanee to a great and earnest religious
revival, and we believe that' it will
continau to spread, and increase in
fervor, until it culminates in the
election of a Legislature composed of e
representative men of the State. There t
is but one danger that threatens this
movement, and it is well to warn the
people against it now. Kellogg and
his strikers realize the force sad pow- I
er of the White Man's movement; n
they know that unless checked it is t
certain to sweep the radical party
from power, and they will use every e
possible means to thwart it; they will
endeavor to procure the intervention a
of the Federal government in their
behalf; they will fill the country with
lying stories of ku-klux outrages;
New Orleans will be thronged with i
bogus fugitives from the parishes, and ,
the Republican and other radical p- a
Sfers will teem with cooked-up stories
of persecutions and threats against
their lives, etc.; and all these expe- c
dients failing, Kellogg and his strik- 8
ers in New Orleans will attempt to
make up false returns of the elections r
and count in their own partisans.
Bat we fear none of theie devices. In
the present spirit of our people we
can fosce a fair return of the election,
and we have no apprehension that 1
the Federal government will again
play the bayonet game. There is,
however, a danger greater than any
of these and which we do fear. Kel- I
logg will attempt to soften the hatred
of our people toward himself and
check their movement against his
party by appointing some good men
to offiee, and the party will back this
policy by nominating some accepta
blemen on their ticket. Under or- I
dinary circumstances men are apt to
be deceived by such manifestation of
virtue on the part of wicked and cor
rapt rulers, and to conclude they are J
not as bad as represented. We warn
our people against this delusion, and
advise them to countenance no "good
man" who accepts an appointment I
from Kellogg or a nomination from the
radical party.
There is not one man in ten thou
sand that can hold a remunerative
position under any sort of government
and not become a partisan of it, and
there is no man of any character what
ever but whose acts have some moral
influence upon the community. When,
therefore, a man now accepts office4
from Kellogg or from Kellogg's par
ty, he ceases to be of as; l becomes
a compatriot of the enemies of the
State and of civilization ; he becomes
the partisan of the negro, the carpet- 1
bagger and the scallawag, and a trait
or to his own race. Such men may
claim, u they have claimed before,'
that they are acting for the public
good; that if they refuse the offices 1
worse men may get them ; but we lay
it down as an incontrovertible pro
position, that the public good requires
no man to degrade himself by becom
lug the associate of the enemies and
despoilers of the State; we hold,
farther, that no man has over so ,de
pradLd himself believing he was act
ing for the publice good; such profe-.
siots are bat a cloak to the real mod
tive; and when a man accepts place
and pay from the oppressors of his
people, and becomes the pensioned
accomplice of corrupt and infamous
combinations, he does s, solely from
selfsh motives, and becuaase he can
put money in bhis pured.
Let us strip the cloak from the real
motiues of these men, let it bedis
tinetly understood that oar object is
not to obtain through the machina
tions of telleogg a passably good man
il .~ ie i this or that parish, but
that eur alm and purpose is to destroy
the peasant*orrupt government, root
and braeb, rnd that we will visit
with pablic obloquy, every man
whete caupidity promapts him to seek
itsfavors. We are striving with ear
nestnems of heart to re-establish in
Louisians the eivilisation of the age,
and In tbhis great sad holy work we
askm no man to egrade himself; we
want no relef that comes through
the preqtitutimon of the manhopi of
our felloW-eitians;, we want n ser
rices from oar fellowmen that are not
noble, lofty sadpure; we want noa
body to see usa by aeptiag the
servica and the pay of the miscreants
who have ruined our State and iam
poverished oar people, and those who
pretend to be serving usin this wise,
we should lash with the whip of seorn
and contempt into their true position,

The "organ" of Saturday last, is
dissatisfied with the "smmsary ejec
tion" of the Republica. Reform lead
ers from office, by the tax.-paying
citizens, and says no demonstration
was made opposing it, and why ?
pray tell us, it was for no reason that
they did not try, for that was surely
the case, but the colored man knew
as well as the white, that the officials
in power were a thieving set, and
were as anxious to rid the communi
ty of their presence as any one.
What do you call the threats of one
who was appoiated by Gov. Kellogg,
to burn Gins, Residences, slay white
men, clothe our women and children,
vs Eve of old, in fig leaves, and domi
cile them in bark hats, is not that a
demonstration ? We think so, and
one with a vengeance. Whether the
Republices and its friends believe it
or not, but such nevertheless is the
fact, the tax-paying people of Natchi
toches have stood this rule of plan
der just a long as they intend to, and
the sooner the minds of those gen
tlemen (t) who think contrary, are
made up to submit, the better will it
be for all concerned.

Dear little Corinne! How often do we
recall thy ever smiling face, bright with
health and beauty.
We offer to the afflicted parents the
sympathy of a heart overshadowed by
the same sorrow-a shadow that is never
lifted from the soul.
Dear baby Corinne ! A name and a mem
ory ; and thsis all we have of thee on
earth save the little grave that maternal
love will care for, and laden with holy
tears of affection ; but in Heaven, thou
art among the angels, and thy loved
voice which shall nevermore be heard by
us on earth there helps to s well "the
anthem of the skies."
Another little form asleep,
And a little spirit gone,
Another little voice is hushed,
Anda little angel born;
Two little feet are on the way
To the home beyond the skies,
And our heart are like the void which
coms,
When a strain of musie dies.
A pair of little empty shboes,
And a lock of baby hair,
The little toys our darling loved,
And the dress she uied to wear
The little pravein the shady nook
Where flowers will love to grow,
And these are all of the little hope
Which came ten months ago.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest sad Beet Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more then half a century the
Saturdsy Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
,The Best Family Paper
that is published in thiseountry, from its
never outaining anythbing that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the iaturday Even.
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhpas its younger contemporaries,
is not, its that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SUN11, SOLID AND SUBSTATIAL,
based upon two intrinsic marit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex.
traneous Influences, such a the populari
ty of individual writers, &o.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even
ins Post has been 16 tim pas, it Is our
intention to make it still better in the
fture, and with this object in view we
will sdeet a maked improvement in eve
ry department of the pape~r, and will
call to our esastance wr te of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By nlcreasing its former attrastlegs,
and adding many judicious and plesa
|lo noveltes, by studying how to plese
Scultiva the popular taste, by In
ereasig ndustry and enterprise, and by
enlarged taclities, we hope to make new
ids with seek ad every issue, sand
coatinue to maintain the claim of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of TIg
OLDt AND THmE m= of Family Story
Papers.
