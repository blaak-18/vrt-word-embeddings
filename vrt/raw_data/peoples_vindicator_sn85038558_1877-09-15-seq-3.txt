to far, an unihealthy sunnmmer, but be

ourselves on so few fatal rcsnlts.

The Rev. Dr. Harmon was in out

Improvements.
There is no such thing as imnprOve

We hear the persimmon ctrop is cx

felicitate ourselves on the prospect of
fat oposaums this winter. It reminds

the infinite void t -that the love, which
like a fhii a ii(nd ever flowing streani, made
green so many of the waito places of
life is threver left to its. io, i-hildren
and friends whom n lle lovted,. the grave
has no powter to hold suich ii heart in its

universe of God it lives andlthrobs with
more than human titality, it niay bei to
minister even yet, to. you, in hours of
trial and suffering. "He nmaketh his an
