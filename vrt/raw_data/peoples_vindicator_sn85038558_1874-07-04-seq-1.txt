What Came of a Matrimonial
Trade on the Suwanee. 1
INew York Sun Letter.! ]
As I came down stairs the other 1
morning I saw Capt. Frank Sams, a t
noted hunter, seated on the edge of l
the stoop, swinging his feet into a t
rosebush. "Look here," said he,
"you think you know something n
about Florida murders. The Lang 1
and Cochrane stories ain't a patch to
the beauties of the Suwanee country. 1
Out there they make a wholesale bu- I
siness of it. Some timne ago two men t
named Locklier and Munday lived t
near the month of the Suwanee river.
They .raised cattle for a living.
Locklier had an average looking wo
man for a wife, while Munday was a
widower with a mighty line daughter.
The two men got quite thick, and
used to cow drive together and eat
in each other's houses. After a tioe
Mundy took a fancy to Locklier's
wife, and Locklier took a fancy to
fMundy's daughter. So they struck
up a trade. After palavering around,
Mundy ofttered to give his daughter
for Locklier's wife and twenty head
of cattle. Locklier took him up
strait, and the bargain was made.
I asked the captain what kind of
girl the daughter was.
"Well," le replied, "I've heard she
was a plump little filly, about eighteen
years old. Locklier's wife was a lit
tie skinny, but she was a good driver
and worked well in harness with her
husband. The daughter never made
any objection to the bargain, and the I
witfe, like most of the women, was
glad of anything for a change. So
Miundy drove off the twenty head of
cattle and the old woman, amd Lock
lier shook hinmself down in the cabin
with the daughter. Things were all
snug. Well, in about two weeks
Locklier's wife got sick of it. She de
clared that her husband was bad
enough, but he was an angel along
side of Mundy. She went back home,
and swore that she wouldn't live
with Mundy any longer under any
circumstances. Then Munday came
up to Lockller's house and wanted
his daughter back. The daughter by
this time had fallen in love with
Locklier, and you couldn't have
driven her out of his cabin with a
pack of dogs. Locklier said she
shouldn' unless the old man drove
back the twenty head of cattle.
Mundy said he'd see Locklier in hell
before he brought back the cattle,
and threatened to shoot him if he
didn't turn over his daughter. Lock
lier told him to shoot and be dod
drotted. So they parted bad friends."
THE CART-WIIEEL IBATTERY.
I interrupted the Captain by ask
ing what the neighbors though of
such proceedings.
"Well," he replied, "they didn't
have many neighbors. What they
did have were like themselves. They
looked upon the whole thing as a
bona fide bargain, and if one or the
other got cheated it was no outsider's
business. As I was saying, Mundy
declared war. He threw up a sort
of parallel around Locklier's house,
and bombarded it with a double-bar
reled shot-gun. All day long hlie laid
around the house, waiting for a shot.
Locklier was afraid to go out or even
show his face at the window. For
hours he would sit on a chair with
his old rifle across his knees and
watch the door. Whenever the latch
moved he would blaze away without
waiting to find out who was coming
in. Two or three times he came near
shooting his wife when she was out
after a pail of water. You see he
knew Mundy meant business, and he
wasn't going to let him get a twist on
him. Mundy skirmished around the
honseuntildark. Then lhe traveled
home and got a good night's sleep;
but by dayhght Locklier again found
him intrenched outside the door.
"This arrangement lasted several
days, and Locklier began to get tired
of his imprisonment. One night lihe
took a couple of stout cart wheels
standing near his cabin, boarded
them in on three sides with two-inch
plank, and when Mundy 'put in an h
appearance the next morning con
fronted him with this movable bat
tery. The tables were turned. The
old man had to fall back. Locklier
followed him up the road with his
battery, shelling him at every jump.
Mundy Was diiven into his head(hlulr
ter, and his atag ,nit to k t'o ' :'
of besieger. A dozer: L .!
changed hlr re eunu :w1n, ! ; ,
lockli ,r .- ' :.,-k to his house ,:n
der covetr f the battery. Before the
roosters stopped crowing he was again
moving the road toward Mundy's
house, shelling his way every few
rods, and driving the old man and
his shot-gun to cover.
TIIE 3100NLIGIIT TRAGEIY.
"Well, the war was kept up in this
way about a week, but at last it had
to come to au end. One bright moon.
light night Locklier thought lhe would
quietly wheel his battery up the road
and see if he couldn't catch Mundy
outside of his fortifications. So lie
laid his rifle before hunm, and set thet
wheels agoing. lie had shoved themi
about a quarter of a mile, and was
just turning a curve in the road when
he heard a scraping noise on his left.
Mundy had flanked him. By the
light of the moon he could see the
old man on his knees behind a fence,
shoving the bairels of his shotgun
between the rails and getting his
head down to take aim. Locklier
had no time to lose. lie snatched
his rifle and sighted it. They tired
together. Mundy fell dead with a
rifle bullet in his head, and Locklier
tunabled into his battery with eleven
buckshot in his breast. He lived
about four hours, and declared if he
hadn't been listening to the crickets
ihe would have seen Mundy before the 1
battery passed him. The wife and
daughter buried the two men, divided
the twenty head of cattle and got all
the property."4
"De Pervisions, Josiar !"
A COUPLE OF DARKEYS EXPRESS THEIR
IDEAS ABOUT CIVIL RIl(GHliTS.
A sapient looking Fayetteville dar
key, oscillating between twenty and
twenty-fivei summners, overtook an old
negro on the street the other day, and
wedging him in a fence corner, pro
ceeded to acquaint him with all the
gorgeous provisions of the Civil
Rights bill. Young Africa imparted
to old Africa a fild of valuable in

"\Well, Uncle Billy, Sumner's swivel

The 1)anbury News man details the
incidents of his temporary sojourn on
the fourth day out. An elderly geli
tlenman u ith eye glasses had his sta'r º
board end to the intruder at the time, 1
busily engaged peering at the horizon E
fromn beneath one of the ifel,oats. It
struck him on the beam, and filled t
his (oat-tail pockets with salt water, t
'"Helen Blazes," said he, and steped i
down stairs to see her. The fearful
and continuous rolling of the vessel
was the cause of painful and ludicrouts
accident of course. The intellectual (
man, with long brown overcoat that I
touched his heels, and sharp, inquir
ing eye, that seemed to reach into
everything, was knocked off his feet t
by a wave, and, besi.es being dren- t
chited to the skin, was driven out of 1
sight by a little boat. Bailey enjoy- I
ed that trip better than he did. One r
of the stewards-a bald-headed gen
tlemnan-was "teetering" along the
leck with a plate of highly seasoned
beef in one hand a cup of hot tea In
the other, when a sudden lurch of the 1
vessel lifted hint into the air, and
drove, him with great violence against
the guards. The spiced beef and a
fork were never heard of again, but
the tea lie saved by catching it under
his collar. One lady was cut in the
head and one gentlemtan broke a num
ber of his legs, but was out again in
an hour eating a Welsh rabbit.
In our wanderings we have convers
ed with a large number of mechanics,
draymlen, clerks, professional men and
merchants, and troi all comne expres
sions of the necessity which at pre
sent exists for anu early and thorough
organtization of the white people of
this State for self-defense and preser
vation of their rights. This move
ient has been imade more popular
tlhan it otherwise would have been by
the aggressive demennor of the ne
gtoes within the ipast few months, andtl
is the direct effect of a policy their
leaders have instilled into the negro
mnass8's. In the street ear's, on tihe
sidew:alks, and in fact wherever one
is thrown in contact with them, can
Ibe set tllhat overbhearing manner
which hadl, to a certain degree, died
out two years ago.
What they imiagine can be gained
by su'h conduct; we are at a loss to
know, for those to whom they look'
forguidanuce must know that white
men do not readily forego privileges
enjoyed by themn for centuries. In
earnestness we say thiat, loolking at
the condition of affalirs in this State,
with a thoroughly equipped negro
militia, comrmanded by negroes, the
mtany responsiblle positions hIeld by
them and the enormous power placed
in their hands undler the acts of tihe
past corrupt Legislature, it behlooves
the white lpeople to place tlhemselves
under discipllinet in order that a con
flict of races be averted, atid if niot
averted, tlhat they be in a position to
protect their wives and children.
KEEPINo Orn)En.--0omebody in a

spoonful of powdered sugar of lead,
pour on enough boiling water to dis

Use alum in same way, taking care
that the fabric does not lie upon the

the fabric will injure it.
A FREQUEy'r TROUrIaE WITII KEI no
SENE LAMPS.-The light often is un-
satisfactory while all is apparently in
good order. It should be borne in
mind that, though the wick is but
very gradually burned, it is constant
ly becoming less able to conduct the
oil. )nuring several weeks some
quartsof oil are slowly fillered through
tih wick, which stops every particle
of dust or other matter that will with
utmost care lie in the best kinds of
oil. The result is that the wick,
though it is of sufficient length and
looks as ever, has its conducting pow
er greatly impaired, as its pores so to
speak, or the minute clhannuels by
which the oil reaches the place to be
burned, becomes gradually obstruct
ed. It is often economy to substi
tute a new wick for an old one, evel
if that be plenty long enough to serve
for some time to come.-Agriculturist.
A contemporary says: The exclu
sion of damp from brick-work has
long been an imlportant problem with
,builders. It is stated that one of the
most effective methods of accomplish
ing this object is the following:
Three-quarts of mottled soap are dig
solved in one gallon of boiling water,
and the hot solution spread steadily
with a flat brush over the outer sur
fiace of the brick-work, care taken
that it does not lather; this is allow
ed to dry for twenty-four hours, when
a, solution, formed of a quarter of a
pound of alum dissolved in two gal
lons of water is applied in a sinilar
manner over the coating of soap.
The soap and alum form an insolu
hle varnish, wlnch the rain is unable
to pienetrate, and this cause of damp
ness is thus said to be effectually re
moved. The operation should be per
formed in dry, settled weather.
Another miethod is to use eight
parts of linseed oil and on6 part of
sulpher, heated together to 2760 in
an iron vessel.
To REJtovE LICr vRO. SJisEEP.--A
correspondent of the New England
Farnmer says he keeps a trougliin his
pasture and once in about four weeks
he puts in it two or three polunds of
sulphur (he don't say for how many
sheep), and puts salt on top. He
knows it will clean sheep of ticks and
thinks it will oflice; besides he thinks
it healthful for the sheep, whether
affected with lice or ticks or not.
The great secret of success in farm
ing is to make upon the smallest pos
sible surface, the largest possible
crop.
