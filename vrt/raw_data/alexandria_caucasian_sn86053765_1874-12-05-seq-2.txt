T hose C ertificates .—For sev
eral weeks the Democrat has been
talking no little about Certificates
of fraud and intimidation gotten up
by the radical leaders here and
sent to the Returning Board. We
thought we were somewhat on the
enterprising order ourselves, but
wheu the Democrat gave the as
tounding information that four
hundred had all been fixed up and
sent down and we had never heard
a word of it, we began to think
that we were awfully behind the
times. We have taken no little
pains to enquire, we have sought
high and low and " nary a certifi
cate " nor the trace of a certificate
can we find.
We question the correctness of
the information given to the Demo
crat, and we don't hesitate to say
that with the present lights before
us, we don't believe that any have
been sent down. If the Democrat
has got better information than
ours, let him come out with it.
Tell us where, when and how they
were gotten up and who did it ?
We are athirst for information on
the subject* We know well enough
that the radical leaders here are
none too good to do it if they
thought they could win by it, but
they know that that game is "play
ed,'' and if they have tried it, we
can't get up with " them Certifi
cates." If the Democrat can put us
on the track we want to join with
it and show up the whole matter
and let the people of Rapides know
who are the parties. Speak out,
friend Democrat !
T he F air A ssociation .—The
time for the Fair and Ball to be
given by the enterprisiug gentle
men composing the Board of Direc
tors of this Association is rapidly
approaching, and we hope that ev
ery one who can assist them is
making preparations to do so. They
deserve encouragement at the
hands of our people and all are in
terested in the success of the enter
prise conducted by them. Much of
the immediate prosperity of our
parish depends upon their ability
to continue to give their industrial
exhibitions which are inteuded to
foster aud buHd up the material in
terests of the parish. Their last
Agricultural Fair was not a finan
cial success, and they have now to
resort to this method of raising
funds with which to pay debts in
curred by them in erecting the new
buildings and otherwise improving
their valuable grounds. Encour
agement to them now will return a
good interest to those of our public
spirited citizens who will respond
now to their appeal for assistance.
We predict that their Fair and Ball
will be a grand success.
T he F leta .—This popular pack
et passed down on Monday with
all she could carry, which proves
that her polite and efficient Capt.
J. C. Mitchell, aud her obliging
Clerk, Mr. James Bobbins, are
held in high estimation by the
good people of the Grand Ecore
trade. They are eminently deserv
ing of the success they are meeting
with and we count ourselves among
the number of her friends who are
rejoiced thereat. She takes cotton
at $1 50 per bale, and pays Ware
house charges for storage.
OUR POLITICAL
On the 2nd of November, now
thirty two days ago, the honest
people of Louisiana cast their votes
and elected by a large majority a
State Treasurer, certainly four out
of six Congressmen, and probably
the other two ; a large majority of
the House of Representatives, and
ten out of eighteen State Senators.
The Returning Board have been
now more than a month pretending
to canvass the returns from fifty
seven parishes and have now only
got as low down on the alphabeti
cal list as Caddo parish. At this
rate, with the intervention of the
Christmas holidays and the rule
adopted by the Board not to pro
mulgate the returns until the votes
of all the parishes are counted, it is
certain that when the time comes
for the assembling of the Legisla
ture in January, we will have had
no official promulgation of the vote
of the State and anarchy and con
fusion will reign supreme.
Both legislatures will assemble
as required by law on the first
Monday in January, and we will
have over again the contest of 1873
between two State governments
Meanwhile Congress will have been
in session one month, and there is
no telling what they will have done
to relieve their radical co adjutors
from the consequences of their fair
defeat at the polls. The programme
seems to be that Kellogg, Packard,
Casey & Co., will now favor a new
election and attempt to get Con
gress to order it. Failing in that
they will organize a Legislature
out of the defeated candidates,
each house under the Constitution
being the judge of the qualifica
tions of its own members, Kellogg
and the Supreme Court will recog
nize this bogus concern and then
they will appeal to Grant and Wil
liams to sustain them. It is already
reported that Grant is pledged to
sustain them with the Array and
Navy. The newly elected Demo
cratic Congress does not assemble
until a year fronp now unies there
should be an extra session ordered
for March 4th, when the term of
the present Congress expires.
All the indications are that Grant
and the Administration will use all
the power they have during the in
terval before the assembling of the
new Congress to oppress and villify
the Southern States. Iiis only
hope for a re-election for the third
term and to save the Republican
party from defeat in 187G is to
change the growing sentiment of
good will in the North to one of
feai and apprehension for the safe
ty of the Union and the protection
of the negro, who is the special pro
tege of the North. The "new re
bellion" is to be the war cry of the
Administration and "a military ne
cessity" the plea for the continuance
in power of the party of plunder,
hate and insatiable greed. A part
of their policy now clearly shadow
ed forth will bo to goad us of the
South to acts of desperation and
then to raise their alarm cry of "re
bellion in the South." If Grant by
sustaining the Kellogg Legislature
could precipitate a conflict between
the citizens of Louisiana and the
soldiers of the United States he
would be well pleased, and if he
could only get a few negroes killed
by inciting them first to riot and
rapine it would give him joy.
We of Louisiana are longing for
peace aud quiet, we have submit
ted to every manner of outrage aud
we are now praying for a peaceable
solution of our difficulties, but we
have need of all the patience that
made Job celebrated for endurance
of long suffering. Pursued by a
cold blooded malignity that will
not be satisfied with less than our
very death throes and clutched by
the ruthless hands of a set of foul
harpies who gloat over our mis
fortunes aud delight in seeing the
failure of every cherished hope of
redemption, Louisiana must needs
draw heavily upon her capacity to
suffer and endure.
For Rapides we can say that
there is a deep rooted determina
tion to await every possible peace
able means of obtaining the fruits
of our victory, but that there is a
deeper, stronger resolve to have
fair play at any cost. We won aud
won in the face of every obstacle,
aud now by the Eternal God who
rules the world we are going to
have our officers fill the places to
which they were elected. No trick
shall swindle us, no delay of the Re
turning Board shall wear out our t
vigilance or weaken our deter min
ation. *

RAPIDES.
its attractions for immigrants
We have in our previous articles
on this subject taken a cursory
view of the general features of Ra
pides, and have had some little to
say of its soil, climate, products etc.
and we have given some statistical
figures. We shall hereafter take
up each of the subjects of which we
have made brief mention and treat
of them more in detail ; onr object
in this article is to present some of
the chief attractions onr parish pre
sents to the man of small means,
with a family who is seeking a home
where honest labor yields a large
profit and a générons soil gives up
its wealth for the trouble of a mod
erate cultivation.
We were formerly on the direct
line of travel from Georgia, Ala
bama, Florida and Mississippi and
the tide of immigration which has
of late years poured into onr Sister
State, Texas, passed by onr very
door. If one family out of ten who
have crossed Red River at Alexan
dria had stopped in Rapides all our
vacant lands wonld have now been
in cultivation and there would have
been no question as to our political
status. Some portion of these im
migrants have since the war stopped
on our Creek bottoms, and their
friends will probably follow them.
The pine woods on both sides of
Red River is rapidly filling up and
our hope in presenting the claims
of Rapides is to make sure that the
tide shall not cease and that we
may hnrry it up.
The first then and chief attrac
tion that Rapides has for the white
immigrant is that its parish gov
ernment is now in honest hands,
that we are no longer under the rule
and domination of corrupt carpet
baggers and ignorant negroes. The
honest colored men at the late elec
tion joined with us and we have
elected a set of honest, intelligent
and capable officers. This will se
cure the faithful execution of the
laws and we are confidently expect
ing an era of peace, law and order,
The importance of this fact, that
our parish government is in hon
est, hands and that it is not likely
that it it will ever again. fall into
the clutches of those who held office
to rob aud sought power but to
abuse it, can not well be overesti
mated. The emmigration to Texas
has shunned those counties where
the carpet-baggers and negroes
ruled, as it would have done the
shade of the deadly Upas tree which
freights the atmosphere with death
and lures the travel stained pil
grim to destruction. The curse is
lifted from off our parish and we
can with pride point to our redemp
tion.
The next and not less attractive
feature is the great diversity of soil
which enables the immigrant to se
lect from all sorts the kind that
suits him best. He may locate up
on our rich alluvial bottom lands,
and cultivate if he chooses, soil
that will yield him readily a bale of
cotton, hogshead of sugar or forty
bushels of corn to the acre; or he
may for much less money and per
haps suit his tastes better, buy
pine woods creek bottoms and make
half as much as on the bayou lands.
The pine woods seem to suit the
movers from Georgia and Mississip
pi better than the low lands and
we attribute it to two facts; first
that the lands are cheaper and se
condly that they all come here with
the idea that the bayous are un
healthy Without stopping to ar
gue as to whether they are or not
or to show that the health of the
bayous is as good as that of the
pinewoods, we can say to the
stranger who is looking for a new
home, that we can give him any
kind of laud he wants. "You pays
your money and you takes your
choice."
Perhaps the greatest of all the
inducements we have to offer is the
excellent local markets we have
here, for not only cotton, sugar, corn
and other staple products but tor
everything the small farmer raises
at home, from a dozen eggs to a
beef or a beet hide, from a pound of
posite sides of Red River, a la vis a
vis furnish the best country market
in the State. The merchants are
enterprising, the people are liberal
and everything finds a ready sale.
Any one of a hundred merchants
will buy your one,-two or three
bales of cotton at from a cent to
half a cent only less than New Or
leans quotations and will pay you
either in cash or trade as you pre
fer. Corn never goes a begging
and hides, tallow, beeswax, chick
ens, turkeys, fruit, ducks from Cat
ahoula lake, fish from Big Creek
and even the gophers from the pine
hills all find a ready market. Old
iron, brass, copper anything from
a carpet tack to a steam boiler can
be sold without any trouble. This
facility of disposing of not only his
crops but such small things as be
might have about the place or raise
specially for market, should make
a residence in Rapides desirable for
any one looking for a new location.
And besides all this in the summer
months after the crop is laid by the
small farmer in the pine woods can
find a ready sale at $2.00 per cord
for all the pine knots he will hanl
to the river, and in the Winter
when all his cotton is picked and
his corn gathered he can get steady
employment for two months hanl
ing sugar and molasses to Alexan
dria. Verily Rapides is a very par
adise to the small farmer in the
pine woods.
to be continued.
The Steamer Sabine Sunk.—
We regret to announce that our
popular packet Sabine, Capt Dick
Sinnot after leaving here on Wed
nesday with a full load of cotton su
gar and molasses, struck a snag at
or near Stonewall Landing, twenty
three miles below here and snnk.
Her stern lies in 15 leet water, and
her bow in 5 feet.
This occnred at 11 o'clock A. M.
She had in her hold 130 hhds sugar
and 150 bbls molasses, and had
above deck 600 bales of cotton.—
The sugar will be a total loss, but
the molasses will probably be saved
It is supposed that her freight was
insured on Merchants open policies.
No lives lost. These facts are re
ported here by the Royal George
who went down with the Sabine
and returned on Th ursday. We are
unable to obtain any further par
ticulars.

tore our readers in this issue the
reply just received by us from the
State Superintendent of the West

be seen that he says he has for
warded our proposition to Head
quarters with a favorable endorse
ment, and has not yet received a
reply. He seems to intimât^ how
ever that his Company are waiting
for the building of a Railroad
through here. It will not suit us
to wait any longer for a telegraph
line. It does not necessarily have
to follow a rail road and as our rail
road facilities are in the indefinite
future, we will insist upon having
a telegraph line at once. Wetoope
that our propositions which were
to furnish an Office, Operator, Fu
el, Lights &c., at the expense of
our town for one year or to raise
$1000 subscription here, will be ac
cepted and that we will have the
line. We are bound to have it any
how, somehow or other and we shall
not give it up so.

Editor Caucasian—
Dear Sir:— I received a letter
from you lately in reference to a
telegraph line up Red River, to
which I intended to reply at once
but somehow the matter has escap
ed me. Your letter with a favora
ble endorsement was immediately
forwarded to the Executive but no
reply has reached me as yet.
The subject has been frequently
considered heretofore and but for
the many delusive promises of a
Railroad in that direction made
from time to time, it is probable
that the line would have been built
some time ago. I hope the newly
projected road won't end like the
others, or that if it does so end, it
will end quickly, and not like its
predecessors deter us from doing
anything.
Very Respectfully,
D. FLANNERY,
Superintendent.
He Talked In His Sleep.—
There is a man in Jersey City
who owns an elevator. The other
night he was asleep and his wife
was awake. He dreamed, and he
muttered words in his sleep. She
listened. He said: "Dear Ella—
darling Ella—sweetest Ella!" She
would hear no more. She grabbed
him by the shoulder, shook him till
he woke, and then shrieked, "Who
is dear what?" he asked, with a
surprised look. "The dear Ella you
have been calling darling and sweet
est in your dreams." "Oh! I must
have been thinking of the dear el
evator which has cost me so ranch
thought and trouble for the past
two months. It's been all outgo
and no income with it." The wife
subsided. She may have been fully
convinced that he was wholly truth
ful, but she keeps a very suspicious
eye ou him. He chuckles when he's
alone, and says, "By George, that
elevator was a lucky thought. If
she only knew?" Then he chuckles
a little more, and goes and eleva
tes'his elbow.
M r. J ohn W eil .—The new Ad
vertisemeut of Mr. John Weil, whose
newly^tocked and well appointed
Store is on Front Street, opposite
the Ferry Landing, makes it known
that he has just returned from
New Orleans with a new and Com
plete stock of goods which he pro
poses to dispose of at orjee at pan
ic prices. When John tries he is a
hard man to beat at any thing, and
we know he is trying now to get
rid of that stock for Cash or Cotton
in a mighty short time and at
very small profit. Buyers know
where to go for cheap goods.
John buys cotton for either cash or
trade. He wishes us to make spe
cial mention of his complete stock of
New F urniture which he has
brought up. His is the only stock
in town and he has marked it down
at low figures.
CP 3 Mr. Isaac Sackman keeps the
very best quality of beef at his
Stall in the Market House. We
know whereof we speak, having
just risen from a breakfast off of
the juiciest, most tender and satis
factory steak which it has been our
good fortune to have for a long,
long time. Get your beef from
Sackman !
O rgans and M elodeons .—We
invite attention to the card of Geo.

the country in its line, and their in
struments rank among the very
best.

years with Sproule & McCown, and
known far and near as one of the
best salesmen and most courteous
gentlemen in the business, will be
glad to see his friends again at the

At ll;45 o'clock Wells cam» ta
the conclusion that it was a good
time to start to woak, and called
the board to order, all the member»
and Mr. C. Cavanac, ot the Demo
cratic counsel, present.
In reply to the question of Mr,
Arroyo, Wells stated that no com
munication relative to the resolu
tion of the board m reference to the
returns of DeSoto parish bad been
received ; that he had had a con
versation with Field; he (Filed)
had said that he had not yet uda
up his mind as to the right of Him*
self or the board to take any such
action as the resolution contem
plated ; he thought Moncure thé
candidate for Treasure«, snoald
take proceedings. (Query, why
Moncure rather than Dnbnclet f)
The returns for Catahoula Par
ish were taken np and canvassed,
and Concordia was taken up for
consideration. The returns were
by no means complete, but such aa
they were, they were canvassed.
Mr. C. Cavanac gave notice that
he would enter a protest as to poll
5, on the gronnds of fraud in the
count. He said that the ballot-box
bad been carried sixteen miles from
the polling place, taken into a room
and there connted, and it was forty
eight huurs after the close of the
poll, before the returns were filed.
On the completion of Concordia
parish the board adjourned until 6
P. M.
On the opening of the evening
session, Mr. Arroyo offered the fol
lowing resolution :
Resolved , That the President be
requested to telegraph to the Clerk
of the District Court for the parish
of DeSoto for the production be
fore this board of the original elec
tion returns, ballot-boxes, and oth
er documents filed and deposited
in his office by the supeivisor of
registration of that parish, with the
view of compiling add canvassing
of the votes of that parish.
The board declined to pass on it,
Wells, who manages matters, stat
ing that the board could take uo
action on parishes that were not be
fore them. That the duty of the
board was to canvass and compile
returns, and could act only on par
ishes where returns are before it.
Mr. Arroyo withdrew the resolu
tion.
The returns of Caddo were can
vassed, and the boalfd adjourned
until 11 o'clock this A. M.
Lexington's Old Age.
[From Scribner's Monthly for December J
Nine miles from Frauktort, on
the road to Lexington, stands ono
of the finest aud richest farms in
Kentucky—that owned by Mr.
Alexander. On this superb stock
farm we saw three hundred blood
ed horses, ranging In rank from
old Lexington, the monarch of tho
turf, to the kittenish aud frisky
yearling. Here also Mr. Alexan
der has collected $100,000 worth of
cattle. We saw one diminntive
heifer worth $27,000, aud a variety
ot foreign creatures whose valuo
seemed almost fabulous. On this
farm are bred the great majority of
fine trotting and runniug horses
which appear iu our parks during
the racing season. Mr. Alexander's
estate, which is admirably stocked
with fine farm-houses, barnes and
stables, and which is more like a
ducal manor than the ordinary
American farm, extends over 3200
acres.
Nearby is old John " Harper's
modest farm of 2000 acres. Tho
roads, the stone walls, and the fine
lawns covered with massive shade
trees, makes a series of delightful
pictures. The annual sale ol hor
ses on the Alexander farm occurs
in June. Ouly yearling colts aro
sold. Hundreds of people from all
the country around, and from eve
ry State in the Union, flock to the
sale. An i m meuse barbecue is held
and high wassail marks the conclu
sion of the occasion.
We paid a respectful visit to old
Lexington, the mighty sire of a
mightier equine family. He is a
bliud veteran of twenty-two, afflict
ed with goitre, and stood gazing in
tho direction from which our voices
came, a melancholy wreck of his
former greatness. The princes of
the race course of the present gal
loped by, neighiug and pawing the
ground, as if annoyed at our pres
ence. One of them, named Aste-,
roid, so tar forgot his princely dig
nity as to charge incontinently up
on the fence where we were seated.
The negro men who manage these
erratic brutes undeigo all sorts of
perilous adventures, but they seem
to possess as many lives as a cat,
like that animal, always land on
their feet, no matter how far the
plunging and rearing horses may
throw them.
