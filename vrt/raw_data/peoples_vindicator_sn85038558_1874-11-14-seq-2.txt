The Faithful Few, the Un:aith
ful Many.
In our Parish there is a large po
pulation of colored individuals known
as "free mulattos," among whom may
be found 'as good men as could be
found in any community. The best
among them, however, are the older
men who were beliked and highly rep
pected by the whites in good anti
bellum days, a few are yet to be found
and they are not difficult of rcogni
tion. They were raised here and vest
ed with all the rights pertaining to
o citisens, with the exception of exerci
sing the light of voting. They owned
D and enjoyed property as did the
t whites, and some of them acquired
considerable wealth, which was pro
tected for them with all the legal ,safe
guards that any body elses propertyi
was, and every body believed before
they were enfranchised, that they
would vote with honest white people
in their attemps to keep down Radi
cal misrule and political plundereres.
And so they would, if the aforemen
tioned elder portion of them could
have kept the upperhand of the young
er; but these latter had their ambi
tion aroused and they could not be
controled. They flocked to the Rad
ical clubs and swallowed their hor
rible oaths as readily as the most ig
norant negro in the country. The
temptation was too great for thetan and
. they soon imagined themselves as
legislators for the State and even for
r the Nation and perhaps among some
of the extra ambitious dreamy visions
of the presidential chair circulated
through their obfuscated brains. And
the elder men not being able to con
trol the younger, like fools that they
were, went with them. Au so they
continued as a class to vote with the
negro party front 1867' up to 1874,
when the muttering of this revolu
tion began to be heard by them and
they thought it about time to look
around and take a reckoning. So
they did; and very few made up
their minds to come to the side of
honesty and intelligence, and faith
fully did they stand to their promiise.
No threats could frighten them, and
'no offers of rewards could seduce
them-boldly they declared their pur
pose to support the People's party,
and boldly did they do it. They are
well known, these particular few, who
manfully came and assisted in put
ting down dishonesty and the "thiev
ing ring" of this Parish, -and long
will they be remembered for it. We
do not wish to praise them too much
for they did but their duty; and we
simply desire to put'it on record. Now
on the other hand, for the unfaithful
many, what must we say of them f
After promising to give their support
to the People's party, after making
profeesion the most solemn, and mak
ing every onel believe they were hon
peat, yet on the day of election they
either voted with the carpet-baggers
and scalawags or skulked in the bush
es nd wereafraid to come out and
Iproclaim their manhood. They had
so long entertained tlheir ambitious
liopes that it was impossiblelfor them
to rudd tly give them up, and they
maid, "good-by 8tate Legislature,

hopes if this negro party fails. r
Not belongingto either clas, stand
ing alone by themsoelves, isolated by
their insignificance, they have in
vited curses front one party and con
tempt from the other; and in future
the only way for them to. regain the
respect and consideration of the bet
ter pprtion of our eitizens, is to go
withthepn, aad in all elections vote
with them, then perhaps, if capable,
some office may be fomod vacant for
theniem and the people would be glad
to reward them. ,'

The Exodus from our Parish.
The Radical carcass not 1ieing able
to furnish pickings for the birds of
prey Qf this parish,, they begin to try
their wings to see if they will bear
them to other scenes and other fields.
The swarming has commenced, and
directly they will sail high into the
atmosphere to look for another dead
body of carrion into which they may
Idip their filthy beaks. From this
parish they go reeking and stinking
with the foul stench of their dirty
work, and it willbe next to impossi
ble for them to find disinfectants
I strong enough to free them from the
disgusting odor.
"Rats abandon a sinking ship"
hence the great 'move among ..the
"birds of a featqier" in tlhis parish.
Their day of Âºpok'er has ended for
then in everlasting gloom, and no
sun will ever arise to dispel it, hence
forth they must persue their way in
utter darkness,
In taking a retrospective view of
the last eight years in this Parish
I among the haunts of the?;e v:atnpires,
it is enough to make any onie ick and
grow faint at the enormity of their
crimes, and the inditfferentism of our
ipeople to have stood such unlioly
things for so long a time. Bunt thanks
to all things good, the day haseomne
when such things will not be endured
any longer, and if any of these "birds
of a feathet" are left behind they
must confine their walks to narrow
limits, and feed upon the offal to be
found stowed aiwlay by thelm in the
days of their prosperity.
The people of this parish have en
dured enough to make them risk any
thing to free themselves from the.
presence even of their enemies, and
they are not to be deterred from the
firm resolution they have taken. It
is useless for themn to think about
compromises, conciliations and mo
tives of policy, the control of the af
fairs of this parish together with the.
atiirs of the State, is to go into the
hands of intelligent, honest and capa
ble' men, cost what it may,
When ever brave men bai d them
selves together to attain any particu
lar object, and that object one of the
dearest rights known to freemjien, per
sons should be careful how they stand
in the way of the success of such un
dertakings, for so surely as they do,
they will go down and be lost in the
vortex of ruin and annihilation. ,The
people of tlis iparish have for long
years suffereA, wrongs, and they are
not apt to sob: forget the authors of
these unavenged wrongs,, they are
but human, and nothing super-human
can be expected of them. The deep
and lasting thought is in the breast
of every one, thait the only way to
avoid the risk of a repetition of such
#bings as they have suffered, is for
ever to free themselves of the pres
ence of these evil doers in our midst,
Do not suppose for a moment that
the partial success of the late elece
tions will satisfy thermor mrke them
less vigilant. The work, has just be
grn and ,.*ey w$1,,never, never stop
short of complete and undoubted suc
cess, and woe to the persons whe
dare stand in the way.
It is impossible for any qnosidera
tions to.have themi; whatever might
have been their former status, or
their present social relations and fam
ily connectidna, down they inust go
to rise no more.Thie minds of the
people of this parish are fully made
up and nothing can change them.
Years eanuot obliterate the memory
of the eoitrage perpetrated on, our
people and our best citizens, and they
would not forget is't 'if they eopld.

The Parish Judgship,
Some irregularity appearing in the
count of box No. one, ward twelve,
for the office of Parish Judge, where
in it appeared that J. E. Breda was
one vote ahead of C. F. I)ranguetÂº,
for the said office of Parish Judge,
the latter proceeded to the Court
House and in company with the Com
missioners who held the said box,
and in the presence of Leon Gre
neaux, Deputy Clerk of the District
Court and custodian of the boxes
containing the ballots, they proceed
ed to recount the ballots in the said
box, and upon the recount carefully
made by them, (the commissioners)
they discovered an error of one tally
to the credit of said Breda, which.
would, therefore, make the total for
him 1477, instead of 1482 as publish
ed in the official returns, and for C.
F. Dranguet 1481. Dranguet beating
Breda four votes--all ptoper affida
vits have been made and the papers
carefully arranged to be forwarded to
the Returning Board in New Orleans,
for their consideration. It will there.
fore be seen that Drangnet has been
duly elected to the office of Parish
Judge, and he must be comnmissioned
by the proper authorities. This thini
of electing one candidate and putting
in office another, is about finished
and the people do not intend to sub
mit to it any longer.

Cot.FLx, Nov. 9th, 1174.
EDITou VINDICATOR :-A few days
previous to the election, (I think it
was exactly six days) the notorious
William Ward and his go-and-fetch
puppy, II. B. Phillips, arrived at this
quiet village after an absence of about
eighteen mouths. Twelve hours or
less after their arrival they were reg
istered in due form, and of course
took the necessary oaths: that they
had not come to this parish for the
purpose of voting, and that they had
resided in this parish for the ten days
next preceding, etc.
Ward ran for the Legislature and
Philips for the Parish Judgship. Out
of the live boxes fixed upon by the
Police Jury, only one was opened:
that at Colfax, 1st ward. By a sin
gular coincidence, the lIt ward, that
of Colfax, has about four hundred ne
gro voters, all Radicals, to aboutÂºfty
white, about forty of whom are IJ -
ocrats. There were several Radical
candidates for the various parish of
fices, and though our parish has a
Democratic majority of some two
hundred, yet were the Radicals so
conident of success, that the return
ed Representative declared that if he
should receive only twenty votes, be
was sure of his seat. Phillips was
returned for parish Judge, and "geno
tie" Willie Calhoun, for the Legisla
tnre. "Little," "Sweet" or "Gentle"
Willie, is a good specimen of a Radi
cal: his moral and physical natures
corresponding with each other.
The Supervisor of registration took
upon himself to change the comumis
sioners of election, by virtue of his
being a member of the Police Jury
an offie which he had resigned more
than fifteen months before.
Ward is a good Radical. He be
lives, and tirmly believes, that none
but Radicals should holh office. But
then, Ward must be "one of them."
The election is all wrong if Ward is
not elected. Hance he was mad at
the result. - Baron Levy said of Ran
dull Leslie, that the latter, notwith
standing his talenrt, was "a failure,"
and Ward felt that Kellogg would say
the same of him.
He therefore kicked up a fuss;
first with Radetzki, our Tax-collec
tor. He and his friends crowded
Radetzki; but Radetzki .managed to
get away. When he returimed? pre
pared to make an isstue, man 'to niai,
Ward and his butumers were conven
iently absent.
A day or two afterwards, iWard
held out the olive-branolr of peace to
Radetzki, lnd after remarking that
men of the same party should be
friends and not enemies, that by
genes should be by-gones-begged
him the loan of sixty, dollars. Ia
detzki agreed with him in all-except
the sixtydollars.
On Saturday Iist, about sundown,
a certain apt. Moses, :who had come
up-fronm New Orleans with Ward and
Phillpt, bringing p wiwthithbiti a
eoinmiesion from Geo, Kellog, either
as sohool-teacher or schoolhdirector,
(I don't know whielf) 'wa in an alter
cation or discusion with Ward about
some matter or other. All of a sod
del, Ward pulled out lhia pistol and
fired at Moss, etdently sminmg at the
head of his opponment. Moss threw
up his srm,mad thereby saved his
life'at the expense of bhis right itu,
whicm.xeceiv~ld tile ball--the lari
ranging backward u and downwards,
and lodging onder the aboulder.blade.
Ward fired instantly again, but with
out effect, and immediately organized
a rapid retreat. At the frst ire, Mose
attempted to pull out his pistol with
his right hand, but iartial para-yslj
had already oeeurred. .I)Jaiilg bit
pistol with his left: hadlh hb EfeI at
Ward three timlins one sholi n 'l athe
arm, spother in the breat, ,and the
third in the leg, near thke'k-e. It'is
not kpnown as yet what wiil'be the ra
salt of these wounds.
As I said before, this occurred to
wards sundown on Saturday last.
About the same tihe, or shortly af
terwards, a difficulty occurred be
tween several colored Radicals and
Radetzkl, the afore-mep'tioned Col
lector. What it was abouat, I don't
know, but I suppose it' grew oat of a
report that Badetazk had voted thel
Democratic ticket: but he is tooegood
a Republican for that. '~elats were
made to badskli ad jln wan
made that unlessm'he spoloised bo his
knees instanter, he *oulf be burned
out of house and home and have a
hall through hint in hes tlhas.twdivt
hours. Leses than eight honrs after
wards, Radetzki woke up to find his
dwelling in flamnes, ashdliarely escap
ed with his life and that of his fami
ly. They eavedrliothlilnng' tt what
they had on thein i their niglit'-othes.
It was fortanifte for Radetzki that
he discotersed ihe fire thoolate-to save
his hoose." Had h5e didedvered it ini
time, hiaslife would have been the
penalty. As"it 'was, several shots
greeted him as lie Pi.d fI'om the bue,=.
inug timbers. The great light frm,i
the flames warned off the incendia.
ries and would-be inurderers.
t In justice to the troops stationed at
this point some half a mile oft from
the scene of conflagration, it nmay b,
stated that the long-roll was Ltat,
and that strenuous and heroic, though
unavailing efforts, were mane to stp
conflagration.
The following copy of a letter,
sent to the New Orlenna Bulletin,
explains itself. The writer is an oc
taroon, a native of the parish of
Rapides, a policeman of the city of
New Orleans, and a Radical.
After this, it is useless to add that
there is a considerable feeling of u.
easiness in this parish,. But perhaps,
after all, as the Republican or Iladi
cal sheets will nay, it is only another
Democratic outrage.
Yours, - A.
CoLr.tx, Nov. 7th, 1-74.
To J. Sela 3Martin:
I have canvassed this parish theor
oughly among the Leaguers, and have
been treated with the utmost kland
ness by them, and find the laprish lse
publican; George L. Smith run a long
way ahead of Ilis ticket. The muost
trying time I ever met with in life,
was a combat between Capt. Moss,
late of St. Landry, and Capt. Ward,
off New Orleans. It: remiided len
of the days of "Ante Bellum." Capt.
Ward fired first and 'shot one iil,
taklug effect in the rigt airm of Capt.
Moss, which is not thought danger.
ens. Capt. Moss -fired three shots,
tll taking effect, one in the arm, one
in the leg, and one .through the
breast, which the Doctor in atten
dance thinks will prove fatal.
Mr. Radetzki's house was burned
luast night. His house was on fire and
almost hJaued ap before he knew
anything bhout it. .He saved nothing,
and as he at1d hit wife and little oni s
were making their escape they were
fired upon by unknown parties. Eve
rybody is convinced that this fiend
ish piece bf work was done because
Mr. R, was thought to have had some
thing to do with the difliculty between
the abve.-mentuwied parties. Some
parties who are suspected of having
committed this heinous crime, will I
suppose be arrested and be remand
ed according to their deeds. Tlho
Cavalry have been out ,op. oeeeral
raids, but have caught no one. I
have been among the people of Grant
parish and they are quiet and orderly,
molesting no one, and It seems to me
that there is but little use for soldiers
in this part of the country. Ward
has acted badly since his arrival here
le has been very violent. lHe is very
unpopular among the white people.
Alia while I can go anywhere I please,
lhe could not go out of sight of tih
soldiers. Capt. Huie is in good health
'and will lie down on tie next trip of
the boat.
. I think Gov. Kellogg or anybody
else would be safer here than iu New
Orleans. I have never seen in any
counti v people more quiet.
Your most O'bt. Servant,
K. KEARY.
