KNOCKS THAT OUTRAGEOUSLY
UNJUST LOCAL SCHOOL-TAX.
My Dear Sir:—l see in last week’s
Jeff that one W. W. Jester, of Rich
land, Ga., has a long article advo
cating “local tax for public schools,”
in which he seems to want to score
you for opposing it, but stands be
hind a high board fence and prods
you through the cracks. I gather
from the drift of his letter that he is
like the tax advocates of this dis
trict, “has very little property to pay
on and has a Big family to educate.”
He says, “when once tried it will
prove so good that it will be kept
up,” but it does not prove so here.
It was on us three years by a vote of
eight out of about one hundred
qualified voters, the others knowing
nothing about the election, as it was
not advertised. After it was voted
in, the district lines were changed to
cut us down to about forty voters.
And as soon as the law was amended
to allow another vote on it, it was
voted out nineteen to six in this dis
trict, and six to two in a district in
the northern part of this (Decatur)
county. It will also be voted out by
a big majority in the district joining
this on the south as soon as the three
years expires that it has been in
vogue. He grows poetic in advising
Mr. Brown to vote for local tax and
help the heathen at his door. His
statement that it enhances the value
of land in the community where
there is local school tax to almost
double what it was before it was
voted in, is entirely wrong as to this
county, for our lands here were none
for sale at sls to $25 per acre be
fore it was voted in, and now there
are no buyers at $8 to $lO. Mr. Jes
ter says tell Mr. Brown to write Mr.
Pound, who will convince him that
local tax is good; of course, if Mr.
Brown reads only such matter as
comes from the State School Com
missioner’s office. A man to whose
interest it is to have high tax,
would be convinced, but if he is a
thinking man and reads both sides,
he may be a little harder to convince
that local tax is right than Mr. Jester
seemingly would have him be. And
1 think, instead of howling for more
taxes, if the people would read up on
the free schools of Georgia, the sen
timent against it would be so strong
that the Legislature would be forced
to abolish the whole system, for it
is the greatest curse ever put on this
State.
If the children for whom it was
gotten up got any benefit of it, it
would not be so bad, but those who
are able to pay tuition are the ones
getting it all, and ignorance and il
literacy runs rampant through the
land, and taxes piling higher every
year.
I did not intend to write so much
when I started, but could not say
what I wanted to with less. Nor have
I said all I feel, for I can not express
my feelings as I would like to, for
in the free schools we are educating
the negro, which. I have always ob
jected to strenuously.

The Dublin People Were Buncoed —“African
Missionary ’’ An Imposter
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Please give us space for the proof
of “A Negro Fraud and an Imposter
Before the Mixed Meeting in Dublin.”
A friend of the editors of the Laurens
County Herald saw “Notice of Warn
ing’’ in the Wesleyan Christian Ad
vocate and handed it to them for
theii* benefit. They had already been
fighting this negro on the grounds
that they believed that he was an
imposter by what they had read in
his book that seemed impossible.
After seeing this notice of warning
they wrote to the man whose name
was signed to it for better proof.
The following is the letter of warn
ing as it appeared in the Wesleyan
Christian Advocate:
“PLEASE TAKE NOTICE! —A
man named D. D. Lewis, purporting
to be an African maintaining mis
sionaries in Africa, came to Paine
College. We detected him writing
letters to himself as if they came to
him from Africa. In other ways we
discovered him to be a fraud, and
dismissed him from our school. He
is in no wise connected with it. 1
regard this statement necessary as a
protection for the public.
“GEO. WMS. WALKER, Pres.
“Augusta, Ga., March 31, 1910.”
After writing to the man whose
name is signed to the above the fol
lowing is what they received.
“Augusta, Ga., April 12, 1910.
“Messrs. Stallings & Campbell,
“Dublin, Ga.
“Dear Sirs: —Your letter of in
quiry about D. D. Lewis reached me
today. A letter came to him pur
porting to be from Louisville, Africa.
It was supposed to be forwarded to
him from New Orleans. In examin
ing the envelope there was no stamp
on it as received in New Orleans, or
as forwarded. When asked about
this defect, he said that it had been
brought to him from New Orleans
by the porter on the sleeper. He
gave the name of the porter. On
inquiry there was none of that name
in the employ of the road. Uncle
Sam does not intrust letters to por
ters’
“One of our young men became so
infatuated with Lewis’ statement
that he consulted me and was going
to study medicine as an equipment
for more extensive usefulness as a
missionary, intending to return with
Lewis to Africa. This student wrote
to Louisville, Africa, to the person
Lewis directed him to for proof of
his truthfulness. After two months
the letter was returned, stating that
there was no such postoffice. Yet
Lewis had his letters stamped with
a stamp ‘Louisville, Africa’ as if it
were a postoffice stamp.
“When he left school he reported
to Bishop R. T. Williams. The Bish
op expressing himself as in some
doubt as to the genuineness of the
letters, the Bishop received a tele
gram giving a corroborative state
ment of Lewis’ genuineness. There
being misspelt words in the telegram
aroused still further his doubts. Go
ing to the telegraph office, he found
out that no such telegram had been
received, but that Lewis had used a
blank, written out a message, and
sent it out by a messenger boy whom
he hired.
“These three facts were enough to
satisfy us that he was a fraud:
“1. A letter to himself purposing
to come from Louisville, Africa.
“2. There is no such place as
Louisville, Africa —no postoffice.
“3. His trying to palm off a tele
gram upon Bishop Williams.
“Yours truly,
“GEO. WMS. WALKER.”
We think after one reads those
letters they can readily form their
own opinion as to this part of the
programme of the Laymen’s Mission
ary Convention. Is it possible that
the people can’t supply a programme
with white men without splicing it
with Negroes? Perhaps the negro
151>e Jeffersonian
had a little “Fish Story” that was
more delicious than the white man’s
tale. The pastors said that they were
being watched by a set of experts
and withdrew their endorsements to
the negro. Some said that they
didn’t see any harm in what was car
ried on in the Court House; that
there was no 'Social Equality in it,
but if this is not Social Equality we
want to know what Social Equality
is, any way. If singing together,
mixing and mingling voices and shak
ing hands in worship is not Social
Equality, what is, any way? If one
would ask what Social Equality was,
you could answer by saying associ
ating with them on the streets, talk
ing in the parlor together, and go
ing to church together. In this case
they went to the Court House, but
it spelled the same thing.
If nobody had exposed this im
poster he could have come again to
entertain a white audience with a
spiel like an automobile tale, or a
race-horse story. We are sending
this to let the people who read the
other piece see the whole thing.

A Suggestion to County Police
Dear Sir:—There are so many
crimes being committed by loafing
and unknown negroes that I want to
suggest a remedy. And if you will
take a hand and push it with your
usual energy you can get it estab
lished.
If the Legislature will pass an act
establishing a criminal record, and
have a paper published by the State
once a week and sent to every
sheriff, bailiff and marshal in the
State, free, giving the name and de
scription of all criminals that have
escaped (convicts), I think crimes
would diminish, because it would be
a hard matter for a man to get away
and stay in this State if every officer
had a description of him.
If such a law is passed the arrest
ing and detention fee should be
vouched for by an officer, then all
officers would keep his record with
him and if he saw a stranger he
would look at his paper and see if
he was wanted anyw’here.
I served as bailiff six years, and a
negro convict worked for a neigbor
two years before I knew he was an
escaped convict.
If this or something similar was
established I think it would reduce
crime, and would cost the State noth
ing in comparison to what it would
save in crimes, costs of trial and
loss to farmers by negroes leaving
them in busy crop time.
Officers arresting parties described
in the record should be required to
notify the editor of such arrest so
his name could be taken off the list.
This State could have a co-ouera
tive column for other States passing
such a law, and desiring space in
paper and giving Georgia space in
theirs.
