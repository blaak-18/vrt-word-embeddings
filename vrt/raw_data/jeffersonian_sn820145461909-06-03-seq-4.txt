try and his State began so early and
his life was lived so nobly and so
well that his loss is widely felt by
many classes. His comrades of the
sixties, though in thinning ranks,
will miss him in each reunion when
they gather to renew the ties formed
during the trying days of the civil
strife; in the great organization
known as the Farmers’ Union, which
he did so much to develop, his loss
will be distinctly felt; but, next to

the family and intimate friends,
those who will mourn him most
deeply, perhaps, will be the faithful
“Old Guard” Populists, as well as
the younger reform forces, among
whom he was a tower of strength,
never faltering, never disheartened,
always filled with that noble patriot
ism which was an inspiration to every
one who came under his influence.
Mr. Nalley was but a boy when his
State needed defenders. He laid
down the school books for the grim
weapons of war, and fought through
out the four years’ struggle. Then
ensued a task equally hard—of
building substantial success upon the
ruins left by the war and the deso
lation of reconstruction days. And
as a soldier of peace, proving that
hard work aided by intelligent plan
ning spells prosperity, he was of no
less value to his country than when
he wore the grey. Always ready to
lend his most earnest efforts to up
building any good cause, he was in
dispensable to his community and his
place can never be filled, in the
hearts of his brother-workers. Mr.
Nalley was not only self-made, but
successfully self-educated, for his
studious habits were never laid aside,
and although he left school young,
he companioned with the best books
and kept pace with the thought of
the masters of history, science, po
litical economy and literature in gen
eral.
Soldier, citizen; in his home, and
with his friends; in every relation of
life, he was true and kind and we
lament his passing.

and all train service was
at once resumed. Public sentiment
demanded arbitration, and when
agreement to arbitrate was reached,
the way was paved for peaceful ad
justment of all matters at issue. The
railroad has in the meantime made
certain valuable concessions, the res
toration of certain discharged white
firemen who had been replaced by
negroes, and the recognition of a
grievance committee from the fire
men. The men, on the other hand,
have resumed work cheerfully, pend
ing further settlement and under
standings. For the present, at least,
reason and common sense have
scored a victory and it is to be hoped
that the day of insolent refusal on
the part of corporation officials to
discuss with employees policies af
fecting them, or to hear complaints,
is about over.
While the above is one instance
for congratulation, there remain all
too numerous signs that
a certain type of pin
headed obstinacy is
abroad in the land. Wit

ity of John Kirby, Jr.
(quite a junior, perhaps), who was
recently elected as successor to Van
Cleave, retiring president of the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers.
Mr. Kirby belches forth the follow
ing:
“Our organization is pledged to
face the labor question. It involves
a great principle which cannot be
fooled with, compromised with or
temporized with, if America is to re
main America. The life of the Amer
ican Federation is hanging by a
thread and there would be no mili
tant organized labor today if it were
not for the support of misguided
philanthropists and women’s socie
ties, who are constantly keeping up
the agitation. My policy will be that
of James W. Van Cleave. I do not
believe in compromise with crimi
nals. It is better to bring the whole
labor question to a pointed issue in
stead of temporizing and fooling
with it. The only way to deal with
this animal is to take it by the horns
till it is made obedient.”
Any time the redoubtable Junior
Kirby takes labor by the horns after
the fashion indicated, he will bump
his fat cranium against about the
sort of public opinion just manifest
ed in Georgia. The bully is politely,
but firmly, going to be retired to the
extreme rear and given an unobtru
sive seat. When honest labor is
broadly stigmatized as “criminal” it
is almost time that young Kirbys re
ceive the illuminating benefit of an
application of the hickory gad.

Having skillfully elimi
nated the question of Inheritance
Tax, to which Taft pledged his sup
port, having managed to out-Dingley
Dingleyism, and now getting the- In
come Tax laid on the table, the im
pudence of the Senate could hardly
go further. / In the face of such fla
grant trampling upon all right, jus
tice, campaign pledges, and every
dictate of honor, it begins to look as
though the lamp-post of a Western
reform Senator would have to be
called into requisition. Mr. Taft is,
in the meantime, industriously golf
ing. What does he mean to do? If
he vetoes the Payne-Aldrich bill it
will mean a continuance of the odi
ous Dingley rates, and a period of
useless agitation to be followed by a
longer period of tariff hot-air and
uncertainty. If he does not veto a
measure plainly in contravention of
his expressed and implied campaign
pledges he will stand as black a
traitor as politics has ever revealed.
Mr. Taft owed votes to the consuming
public and his influence should now
be used in their defense. A sphinx
like silence now is no part of states
manship.
The question of pure food is one

its various phases. France

saccarine, large quantities of which
are used by American canners to im
part a certain sweetness, not only to
fruits, but to such vegetables as corn,
peas, etc. Saccarine is 300 times
sweeter than sugar, a very minute
quantity suffices per can. Still, it
must be remembered that it is a coal
tar product and as such its influence
upon physiological conditions is yet
in doubt. Statistics show that heart
trouble is on the increase. For in
stance, among the New York school
children the condition is appalling.
It is perhaps negligence which as
sumes that this trouble is a mere re
sult of complex modern life. It may
in large measure be due to food adul
teration and to the use of benzoate
of soda, saccarine and other agents
which can scarcely be wholesome and
may be terribly dangerous.
In medicine, the coal-tar deriva
tives are classed as heart depress
ants.
Cotton seed oil is also coming in
for examination, and before the use
of this is conceded harmless, careful
experiments should be made. Being
a vegetable product, injurious alka
loids may reside therein.
The meeting of the leading chem
ists in London this week will no
doubt be of vast importance from the
standpoint of pure food. This is
eminently practical and the public
awaits the final word on many of
these debated points.

has been cleared since the plant was
taken over, about twenty-five years
ago. There is now a movement for
reducing the price of gas from its
present comparatively low cost of 55
cents per thousand to 49 cents for
large consumers, and a general re
duction to the general public. Man
chester is about the size of Boston.
Notwithstanding the profits cleared,
the capacity of the plant has been
doubled since 1883.
