RAID ON THE STILL.
1 "Just thought I would stop ty a anin

than I hoped you were all well," said
Mrs. Jonathan Jackson to her friend
Mrs. Samuel Pearl.
"Take a seat, Ellsabeth, and make
yourself at home. It's precious little
conversation, though, one can have,
with one's neighbor about what's going
on in the mountains, with the men folks
talking nothing all the time except
them revenue sharks." And Mrs. Pearl
looked uneasily through the window of
the little sitting-room that commanded
â€¢ a general view of the mountain road
that skirted past her home like the trail
of a serpent and was lost In the gloom
I of the cedar trees that, mingling with
the dense underbrush, caught the eye
on all sides.
"How's Alice?" asked Mrs. Pearl
rather abruptly.
I "Fair as can be expected, Elizabeth.

sighed.
s "Been five year now, Miranda, since

why he leCt here, but folks can't be per

r quisitively, drawing her chair a few
Inches nearer to Mrs. Jonathan Jack

"Well, Ellabeth, knowing you don't
talk about other people's business"
and here Mrs. Jackson looked suspi

Presently the sound of a conveyanc,
was heard in the roadway, and Jona

o' alighted. They had been down to the
village, a ride of twenty miles over tin
ece mountain roads, to provide themselvie
with some necessary supplies.
"'What's the news in the village, Jona
than.?" inquired his wife.
S "Nothing much; sonlme reports ablou

Jonathan relapsed into a moody silence
in The rest of the meal was eaten it
quiet, and after the dishles were clearedi
in', away Jonathan sat comfortably by the
ree fire and smoked his pipe, as the Novemn
her evenings were becoming chilly and
unpleasant.
After an hour had passed there was
the sound of a horseman approaching
ter near to the house, and a moment later
someone knocked at the door.
"Does Jonathan Jackson live heret"
I' inquired the newcomer.
"'My name is Jonathan Jackson." an
e swered the master of the house. "What
Is your business?" And Jonathan looked
at the stranger with suBsicion.
"I am making a journey over the
Ily mountains and would I!':" to st:1: ire
to-night at least."
tes For a moment Jon'' a looked str
prised. Then "I ..de the stranger en
ire ter, while he went outside and put up
his horse.
In the light or rne room the stranger
Is, appeared to be a man of some 30 years
ht' of age. Re possessed a dark beard of
luxuriant growth, which concealed
what would have been considered a
handsome face were it bereft of Its
n' hirsute appendage. The guest took his
seat near the fire and kept his peace.
In a few minutes Jonathan returned
and joined the family circle.
as "It appears to me, stranger, I saw you
to-day in the village," Jonathan ven
tured.
ke "Possibly; I was there," the guest an
swered.
"On business?"
"On business."
Then Jonathan was silent for a mo
ment. He was apparently ill at ease.
"I suppose you have heard that it is
J. pretty dangerous traveling in these
parts?" again ventured Jonathan.
n "Is it?" said the stranger. And Jona
re than became more dissatisfied with his
Id way of eliciting information.
id "Stranger, it appears to me that it
might be better that you give your
name and business in traveling over
le these mountains," Jonathan spoke
e, bluntly.
g The stranger's eyes flashed like coals
of fire, and then he answered calmly:
tt "My name is Arthur Smith. My busi
rl ness was that of a moonshiner or keeper
tf of an illicit distillery-that is, until I
d was driven out of North Carolina."
d "Why, why tell me this?" Jonathan
i1 asked surprised.
n "Because I believe I am speaking
h with a brother moonshiner. Probably
e you may be able to refer me to someone
in these parts who may need my serv
il ices."
"We will have to see about it," said
the master of the house, without com
mitting himself, and In a few minutes
e Smith was shown to his room, as the
,f nlht was getting late.
o The next morning Jonathan went out
early an' returned soon after with some
of his neighbor's friends. Smith was
up on Jonathan's return, and the men
all held. a short conference together,
which seemed to prove satisfactory all
e around. The result was that the stran
ger, Arthur Smith, had joined the band
of illicit distillers carrying on thel" call
t ing in the mountains. For the present
Smith put up at the house of Jonathan,
and in the evening, before darkness ap
proached, went up to the latter's still,
located In an old mill on the bank of a
t rushing torrent some distance up the
mountain, whih in days gone by had
been used togrind their corn, which tnry
purchased from the farmers on the low
Slands below.
Reports had reached the mountain
I eers that strangers had been seen in the
village at the foot of the mountains,
and the secret stills were rarely in op
eration of late. Smith, the stranger,
owing to the late turn in affairs, had
plenty of spare time on his hands and
Swould wander off alone up the moun
Staln road and turn off into the dense
undergrowth to be gone hours at a time.
He was a particularly reticent man,
never ventured a question and answer
ed those put to him In the most laconic
way imaginable. Once in a while, when
the others were not looking, his gase
would be riveted on Alice, and Mrs.
Jackson would shrewdly smile to herself
and declare inaudibly that the girl had
made a conquest.
One evening as darkness was coming
on Alice returned from the house of
Mrs. Pearl. where she had made a short
velt, and ooming suddenly around a
bend in the road she observed two men
in earnest conversation. One was Ar
thur Smith, the other a stranger. Only
for a moment did the two men seem to
eonveree, and soon the newcomer had
dlsappeared, When Smith reached Jon- 4
athan's house it was but shortly after
Allee arrived.
lately the mountain stills had been
operated more frequently than for some
time. The reports of the revenue oi.
erm infesting the mountains had be

ben operated with a greater degree
o seeurity.
"We had better be gettiag up the
mountain, lad," Jonatban said one even

re Probabaly some twenty minutes had
elapsed when Smith left the house and
Ip leisurely made his way toward the se

e closely, and when Smith had disappear

'e there was an unpleasant chillinese in
no the mountain air-anti followed in his
tc wake.
The old mill which concealed the still
was some three-quarters of a mile from
Jonathan's house, and as Alice proceed
ed on her way she o:casioually caught
it a glimpse of the forms of strange men
t in the dense undergrowth, going evi
d dently in the same direction with her
[ t-lf. Once a strange man glanced at
n her suspiciously. but did not molest her.
t1 lie was armed with a shotgun, and took
her probably for somne one who was re
turning fromi a visit to a neighboring
m1 ountaineer's home.
Soon the girl reached the old mill. In
the eveuning twilight the dying sun was
g fast disapeparing behind the moun
tains, leaving a faint glare in its wake,
which lit up the scene with a soft gold
en light. Smith, the stranger, was stand

Smith gazed at his questioner In a
startled way for a moment, and then c
with an effort recovered his usual air
of stolid indifference.
"You know me, Alice. I had hoped i
time had wrought such a change in my
nature and looks that none would rec.
ognlize me. You probably know why I
am here." A
"You are a revenue officer, and your
presence here at this moment is to sig. o
nal your men, who are here on all sides, r
to trap my father and the few men who V
are in the still."
"I see you know all. When I left '
your father's house, as I did like a beg- P
gar and an outcast, I swore to ruin him.
If I signal now to my men in the woods
In a few minutes I will have the evi- b
dence necessary to send him to the peni- tt
tentiary. And yet, if you had only taken b
my part, all might have been different." 9
And Ike IIolland's voice grew soft and
sad. d
"How could I take your part, Ike, ex- R
cept by going with you-and you never
asked me to do that?" spoke the girl, a
feelingly. s
"And would you, had I done so?"
Ike did not need an answer to his
question. In a moment he realized that i
he, the hunter of Jonathan Jackson, d
was still beloved by his daughter. In *
the growing darkness of the evening C
the two strolled back to Jonathan's -
house, and the men in the woods, who
awaited their leader's signal, wondered
what changes had taken place in Ike
Holland's plans. Jonathan also was die.
appointed in not seeing Smith at the
still, and after that night he never saw
him there again.
"Ihear that Alice has eloped with that
yoang man who was stopping here,"
said the irrepressible Mrs. Pearl, a few ,
days after the events last narrated.
"Some says as he was nobody other a
than Ike Holland, though I never did s
put much confidence in idle gossip."
Mrs. Pearl had heard of the late turn c
in affairs, and had paid Mrs. Jackson
a neighborly call to verify sundry ru- w
mors which interested her very much.
"Yes, Ike and Alice were married in
Nashville two days ago," answered Jon- m
athan's wife.
"And what does Jonathan say?' ruth
lessly questioned Mrs. Pearl.
"What can he say?" And Mrs. Jack
son's eyes snapped resentment at the
question. "Hie's got sensible at last,
and says he never would have given Ike
Holland credit for such courage. Any
way, now that he has got a son-in-law
a revenue officer he declares he Is going
to quit keeping a still and live an honest wi
life. Maybe one of these days I may
persuade Jonathan to run down to
Nashville with me, but not ]ust yet."-

Demand tor Mother of Pearl.
Considering the vast values In gem
pearls obtained from the eastern fish
cries, It is surprising to find that thq
plain, unromantic mother of pearl se4
cured is of even greater worth. Preot
vious to the discovery of the extensive
Australian fishing grounds In 1865, the
supply of mother of pearl was dlmin '
ishtng, while the demand was Increas
ing. The large shelled species already
mentioned are there found in fine qual
ity. The shells are the size of large
soup plates, weigh a pound each, and
amre worth about $1 a pair. An expert
diver, in diving dress, will collect 800
or 400 pairs in a day. About 100 gem
pearls are found in every ton of these
shells.
Beautiful art work in carved and in
laid mother of pearl has long been pro
duced in China and Japan. Some idea
of the extent of its European use In the
arts and manufactures may be had
from the fact that 800,000 people are
engaged in working mother of pearl in
Austria, and half that number in
France, while the value of the annual
import into England is nearly $1,000,
000. In the Philippine Islands windows
are made of mother of pearl, and James

THE RESTORtTION TO HE4LTH OF A
rPIOMIINENT MAN.
Worn Out by Exposure and Brokea Down
in Health He Was in Misery for
Months-Is Now a Well and
Happy Man-Read the
Story.
From the Necws, Clarksburg, W. Vt.
In the interest of common humanity, your
reporter has. tho honor to send you an inter
esting and prctltable Interview had with one
of Harrison County's most highly esteemed
citizens, concerning his narrow and miracui
ous escape from death. The person referrel
to is Mr. Floydl E. Barnett, of Jarvisville,
West Virginia, who is well known throngb
out Harrison County and other seotions of
the State.
Mr. Barnet' j narrative is as follows: "1
live at Jarvisville, West Virginia, was born
and raised thee-, and am thirty-nine year,
of age. I am a farmer by oocoupation, and
the exposure ant hardships incident to this
life finally overcame a strong constitution,
and in the month of May, 1894. I was seized
with what the medical fraternity pronounced
qiiatic rheumatism.
"Tne disease was first felt ia the hip an i
soon b.camer severely painful. Within a
short time the whole lower extremity was
affected and became tarribly swollen, and at
times the pain which was almost Unbearable
extended up into th l shoulder. I consulted
the best physiclins and speclalists in the
country, some of whom treated me some
time, but to no successful purpose. I used
various patent me.litenes and liniments of
wide recommendation, but none of them
gave relief. I worned along this way for
some months, being unable to work and at
times unable to move. I became restless at
night ant I cull not sleep. The disease
seemed to affe-'t my heart and it was utterly
impossilble to lie on my left side on sccount
of the seriousness of the pain at the heart.
i"My condition seemed a hoplelss one and
I was much discouraged. when by chance I
happened to read an account in the Wheel
inm Independent of the wonderful cure of a
person afflicted like myself, that Dr. Will
iams' Pink Pills had effected. This was some
time in the month of December. I immedli
ately procured a bex and began to use them.
A change commen,.ed at once.
"I continued to take the pills until I felt
eatirely cured To-lay I am a well and
sound man. The pills not only cured my
rheumatism, but drove that troublesome
pain from my heart as well. For more than
a year now I have not been troubled in the
slightest with either malady, or any other
for that matter. I am a strong man and
perform as much manual labor as any far
mer."
Mr. Barnett is a man highly respected for
veracity. His statements are corroborated
by his neighbors and his recovery s ascribed
to the use of Dr. Williams' P.lls. As he talked
to your reporter, he showed every sign of
being a man in excellent health and only too
glad to tell the simple story ef how his life
was saved by the use of the pills.
Dr. Williams' Pint Pills contain, In a con
deused form, all the elements neceseary to
give new life and richness to the blood and
restore shattered nerves They are an un
failing specific for such disease as loeomotor
ataxias, partial paralysts. St. Vitus' dance,
sciatiea, neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous
headache, the after effect of Ia grippe, palpi
