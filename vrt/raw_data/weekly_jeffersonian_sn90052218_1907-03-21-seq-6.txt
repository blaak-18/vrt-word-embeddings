BRITISH COTTON CLOTHS.
Are Being Sent Broadcast to Eastern
Countries.
Washington, March 13. —The follow
ing report from Special Agent William
Whittam, Jr., on the cotton manufact
uring industry of Lancashire, showing
the steady expansion of British ex
ports of cotton cloths, should prove es
pecially interesting to the American
manufacturers and exporters of cot
ton fabrics:
Lancashire’s staple industry has
passed through another year of mar
velous prosperity. The projection of
new mills still goes on. Recently cap
ital was subscribed for two new spin
ning mills at Todmorden, Lancashire,
to contain 120,000 spindles, and num
erous additions are also being made
to old established factories.
A casual glance at the total of
Britain’s over sea trade in finished
cotton products is enough to show how
she must dominate most of the mar
kets in unmanufacturing countries,
while closer scrutiny of the returns
discloses many matters which ought
to command the attention of every
American cotton manufacturer and
Farmers’ Union ‘Department
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
which every distributer of their prod
ucts should study carefully.
The growth of the trade in the last
two years has been truly phenomenal.
The yardage of cotton cloth exported
in 1905 exceeded that for 1904 by 604,-
964,200 yards, and the increase in 1906
over 1905 was 64,511,100 yards, a total
increase for the two years of 669,475,-
300 yards.
The export of cotton yarns in 1905
exceeded that of 1904 by 41,199,100
pounds, and 1906 exceeded 1905 by
2,292,600 pounds, a total in the two
years of 43,491,700 pounds.
The value of miscellaneous cotton
textile manufactures exported in 1905
over 1004 was $150,374, and that of
1906 over 1905 was $7,294,952, a total
in the two years of $7,445,326.
The increased value of all manufac
tured cottons exported in the past two
years was $76,442,110.
During 1906 there was a net in
crease in the outgo of yards of cloth
of over 64,000,000. This was due to
a considerably enlarged demand for
dyed and printed fabrics. The in
crease in these colored cloths was,
however, at the expense of a falling
off in the shipments of gray and
bleached goods.
The average price per pound of
yarns exported was, in 1904, 26.55
cents; in 1905, 24.45 cents, and in 1906,
27.74 cents.
It has been said times without num
ber that the American cotton trade
has but its own indifference to blame
for the comparative insignificance of
its sales to our neighbors, the Latin-
American republics. And considering
the great value of our purchases of
commodies from these countries the
meager share we have in the sales of
the most important of their imports
is simply amazing to our competitors
on this side of the Atlantic.
With Cuba British trade is of con
siderable, though diminishing, magni
tude. With our own non-contiguous
territory, the Philippines, Lanca
shire’s trade is of fair dimensions.
England’s greatest market for cotton
goods is India, and India is also the
largest buyer of such merchandise of
any country in the world, China not
excepted.
K
BAD NURSERY STOCK.
Knoxville, Tenn., March. —J. I. Trip
plet has secured judgment against the
Knoxville Nursery Company, which is
owned by Congressman N. W. Hale,
for $3,500 in the United States district
court, on the ground the fruit trees
were not what they were represented
to be. Evidence showed that out of
a large number of Elberta peaches or
dered only one proved to be an El
berta.
H
TRUST’S OFFICIALS WIN.
Washington, March. —The fertilizer
trust cases, involving the right of the
United States to compel the removal
of the indicted officials of the fertili
zer companies constituting the alleged
trust from Virginia to Tennessee for
trial, were decided recently by the su
preme court of the United States ad
versely to the government’s conten
tion. The opinion was delivered by
Chief Justice Fuller, who held that the
United States circuit court had erred
in holding that the indictment was
sufficient to justify the removal of the
cases without regard to the evidence.
The result was the reversal of the
decision by the circuit court for the
eastern district of Tennessee.
COTTON FIGURES.
(Columbia State.)
Speaking about cotton, its produc
tion and consumption, it is interesting
to note that on advices being received
in New York a few days ago that the
National Ginners’ Association report
ed 12,716,000 bales of the 1906 crop
ginned up to March 2, the price was
advanced ten points. Yet that report
indicated a 13,000,000 bale crop. Good
middling spot cotton is selling for 11
cents or better.
Nine years ago, the knowledge of an
11,000,000 bale crop sent cotton below
5 cents a pound. Comparatively, an
eleven million bale crop was then as
far in excess of consumption, as a
16,500,000 bale crop would have been
last year. And, in addition, the farm
ers were absolutely without organiza
tion, were employing no business
methods, and were financially unable
to hold their cotton to steady the mar
ket. The takings by northern mills
for the season of 1897-98 were the larg
est up to that time. They aggregated
2,211,740, or about 400,000 bales more
than in the year previous. The takings
by northern spinners for 1905-6 were
2,349,478, a gain of only 138,000 bales.
So the increase in consumption comes
from the south and Europe. The
southern consumption in 1898 was 1,-
231,841 bales, an increase of 200,000
over the previous year. Last year the
consumption was 2,374,225, an in-'
crease of more than eleven hundred
thousand bales in eight years, and
showing greater consumption in the
south than in the north.
Up to the present time, the Ameri
can mill takings, and the cotton ex
ported or on shipboard, aggregate a
little more than ten million bales.
There is nowhere evidence of mills be
ing well stocked, except with the com
moner grades. American spinners
will actually need at least 1,500,000
bales more to carry them to the new
crop; Europe will during the same
period ask for not less than 2,500,000
bales. So, even with a 13,000,000 bale
crop, we are going to fall 1,000,000
bales short of supplying the demand.

DIVERSIFIED FARMS.
(Seattle Post-Intelligencer.)
It is to the best interest of every
farming community to secure as many
of those diversified farms as possible.
Every family is an asset in many
ways. The producer is a double as
set, because of adding to the output
from the lands and increasing the
number of buyers for merchandise.
No family can live in the country
without being of some benefit to the
neighborhood. It is better to have the
homes a few hundred yards apart than
to have buildings divided by misel of de
serted roadways.
Washington is destined to become
a great and prosperous agricultural
state. It is passing through the for
mative period between the pioneer
and the small farmer. Old systems
are passing away and new ideas are
being promulgated. The range of a
quarter of a century ago is no more.
Stock raising has become a part and
parcel of the cultivated farms. With
the new era comes the dairy and fruit
farm. More people means more roads
and larger school houses. A thickly
populated community has the modern
advantages of telephones, rural malls
and up-to-date conveniences. Let the
diversified farming spirit continue to
grow.
THE 1906-07 COTTON CROP.
(Atlanta Georgian.)
The American cotton crop for the
season of 1906-07, as compared with
all previous crops, is a bumper yield,
and yet it is not of sufficient size to be
burdensome. From the first bale mar
keted to the present time, it has mov
ed from the plantations to the mills
at a pace that has surprised the trade,
and in greater quantities than the rail
roads in the belt have been able to
move it in a manner satisfactory to
purchasers.
Despite this heavy movement, here
tofore an influence making for a very
low average price, the raw material
at no time during the present season
has shown decided weakness. All ef
forts to break prices to a level below
the views of the producer have failed,
due entirely to keen competition for
an estimated bumper crop, indicating
that consumption is keeping pace
with the increase in production,
though prices are yet below the basis
on which spinners are under contract
for goods extending well into the com
ing year. A decrease in the move
ment, however, would soon remedy
this, and for the remnant of the pres
ent crop much better prices could be
obtained.
In the Lancashire disrict new mills
for the manufacture of cotton cloths
are springing up. Nearly twenty new
mills have been begun the present
year. During the past seven years
more than a hundred have been es
tablished near Manchester. These
new factories, together with a large
number of extensions and additions
to existing mills, when fully complet
ed, will have increased the manufac
turing capacity of this district by 10,-
00u,000 spindles.
New mills have been built and addi
tions have been made to the old mills
in the north and the south.
The increase in spindleage in the
Lancashire district is attributed to
the estimates of a record American
crop this year. The year 1905, the
previous record breaking crop, wit
nessed the greatest boom to British
spinning in recent years, forty large
factories having been added in that
year, against only two mills in 1902.
Important Information.
Since the election of officers in De
cember I have failed to get the name
and address of all local and county
presidents.
This is causing lots of union men
to miss important information.
Organizers and lecturers should im
press the necessity of the locals send
ing in the names and addresses of
their presidents.
Remember that you lose by neglect
ing this. R. F. DUCKWORTH,
State President.
THE NEXT STATE METING.
The next regular state meeting of
the Georgia division of the Farmers’
Educational and Co-eperative Union
of America, which was set at the last
regular meeting to be held in Atlanta
about the last of July or the first of
August, will be held in July.
The state executive committee has
permanently agreed on July 24, 25
and 26.
It was the expressed wish of the
brethren in discussing the question of
changing the time for holding our
state meeting, to have it after the
crops were laid by and before gather
ing time.
