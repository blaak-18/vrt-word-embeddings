flushed with indignation-VI'th aiston

my card.
lie (pulling his waistcoat a little,
because his shirt front pointed too
much)--Is that why you waited for me
in the conservatory? No, please don't
go-let's sit it out.
Miss Katie sits down again and be
gins pulling a rose to pieces. "You've
treated me shamefully, haven't you?"
"Not a bit."
"Indeed you have; erd don't fidget
'with your necktie."'
"Now, which of your pretty white
teeth have you against me?"
"Can't you speak in plain English,
instead of using your French phrases?
tome, now, didn't we Illeet at Devon
shire park? Oh, it's just like you to
hint that we weren't properly iutro
duced; but we were afterward."
"Never mind the fashion of the in
troduction," said lie, hiding a smile bc
htindt his glove.
"You know such introductions are
almost the fashion at the seaside."
"You mean such almost introduc
tions are quite the fashion?" he ob
nerved; "but suppose we did, and sup
pose we took walks together, and
dances together, and went fishing to
gether, and I put on the-, and sun
pose I was in earnest?"
"Never mind what you suppose," she
said, sharply. "You know quite well
that at the seaside-"
"BIy the sea a maiden's fancy lightly
turns to tlhoughts of-flirtation."
"I shall leave you at once if you re
so flippant and rude," said Miss Katie,
and she got up and then sat on another
seat with the light at the back-a very
pretty white back--not the seat's.
"I)idu't you pretend you were a bar
rister?"
"No, certainly not."
"How can you tell such a-"
"It isn't a-. I didn't pretend I amnt a
barrister."
"Well, even if you are. you needn't
quibble, and, besides, there are lots of
barristers who don't earn as much-"
"'\s much as a shoeblack. There's
your Cousin .Jack--but he plays bil
liards splendidly-you should see him
at Carr's during term t'tne."
. "Ilother Jack! And besides lie is a
good sort, and I like him much better
than you! Oh! how could you deceive
ine so? Why, that horrid Glendower
girl who drove me home in her brong
ham-I know it's only hired-the mo
nnent we got in said: 'Really, dear,
that man you so afiiched yourself with
at Eastbourne is quite decent for one
of Whiteley's young men! Ugh! a hired
guest.' "
"lut I assure you, I--"
"Now, isn't it true you came to Mrs.
ilooper's as a hired guest? Weren't
you sent for because at the last mo
ment 'there was a man short, and she
was afraid of thirteen at dinner?
't'here, I knew you couldn't deny it.
Why anyone should ask so many peo
ple to dinner goodness knows--it's har
barous-it's not a dinner; it's a meal.
And you called yourself Hloward--is
that the name you're called? And got
a guinea and instructions in the hall
not to talk politics, theology, or school
boards, or new woman."
"A guinea wasn't the price," said
Mr. Banks, gloomily, biting one of his
gloves, "and I wasn't, paid; it was sent
direct to Whiteley. and we aren't
trusted with the money, and I'm really
a barrister with a good practice, and
you're cruel. Even if it were all true,
you need not hit so hard."
:Miss Katie sat silent for a momnient
and listened to a few bars of "Le Rteve
de Mon Coeur" waltz, that sounded de

limghtful in the distance. She remem
bered how often she had danced to it
with him at Eastbourne, and how well
their steps were matched. She looked
at the young man, and he really was
so handsome and "such good form"
that in her next remark she used a
gentler voice. "You know I shouldn't
have minded so much if it had been
abroad, but everyone will make fun of
me." Then she spoke earnestly: "Sure
ly you couldn't have been such a-such
a-and you can't be telling falsehoods."
"I assure you," he said, eagerly,
"it's not quite as you think. I-" hbe
stopped abruptly and rose and walked
up and down the few yards of the con
serrator-y.
"Oh, there is a mystery!" cried Miss
Katie. '-A mystery, do say so, isn't
there? W'as it a bet? That would be
rather bad form. Still I might---or was
it---oh! do tell-anything but the hor
rible thing I must think? I shouldn't
care about you being poor, but a hired
guest, a sort of waiter with a clean
shirt front and ,unspotted clathes
that's too--oh! I'm sorry to speat so
cruelly if it'i true, but it isn't?"

stooped to pick it up their hands came
in contact. "There's a mystery, but-"
"You musd-I insist-remethbeFi that

avee intentiodn, to ilise Loiotte's tieln.
"llow dare you?" she said, sharply,
and then added, with a faint smile: "I
believe it's a misquotation, too."
lHorace Ianks looked at her very
carefully, and her eyes fell pand seesued
to interest themselves in her falh. A
smile came into his face-a rather
rongish smile. "Mliss W'addington-"
he said, us he sat down i i a seat closq
to hit's, "it really is a secret. and I am
pledged in honor to tell but one pea
son-my wife or my"-a long pause
"or my betrothed."
"Th'at may very well be to two or
even more persons," she answered, des
pern tely.
"Only one. I believ'e,"~ he said. "If t
loved well enough to be engaged, and
nothing came of it. I'm sure I should
never try again."
"lave you never been engaged?" she
asked.
"Just now you seemed very anxious
to know my secret. Arc you prepared
to pay the price? Behleve me, you can
not be half as anxious to hear it as I to
tell it."
Miss Katic felt thankful that the red
in her cheeks might seem due to the
ruby glass of the fairy light. She gave
a half-hearted little laugh and an
swered: "It's too absurd, really--we
women may be inquisitive - though
not so much as you tmen."
lie looked very grave. "But," lie
answered, "I will tell it to no one save

"atYo may take my hand-I as didn't say

"The whole thing is so absurd. On

"I'm not so staid and sober as my cli

have not hesitated to affirm that the
party is in favor of the free coinage of

this time to recall that the only au
tho'-itative iatteroade of the democratic
party oh the etaljet is contained in
the platform of 1892, which was in
diored by the Ohio democracy. The

policy as espeially ilcrtesesiy fur the protec
tion of the farmcr; and laboring ti-mrals the

As to what this meant there coulii be
no real doubt. The friends of free sil
ver had none at the time, for they
moved through 3Mr. Patterson. of Colo
rado, to insert the word "free" before
the words "coinage of both gold and
silver" in the money plank. This mo
tion was emphatically voted downv, and
the meaning of the plank, so far as
free coinage of silver was concerned,
vas thereby put beyond the possibil
ity of misconception or misconstruc
tion. It is worth while to recall also
what President Cleveland said on the
same subject in his letter of accept
ance. Starting with the proposition
that the people are entitled to sound
and honest money abundantly suffi
cient in volume to supply their busi
ness needs, he proceeded:
"Whatever may be the form of the people's
currency, national or state-whether gold, sil
ver or paper-it shoull be so regulated and
guarded by governmental action or by wise
and careful laws that no one can be deluded
as to the certainty and stability of its value.
Every dollar put into the hands of the people
should to of the same intrinsic valum or pur
chasing poswer. With this condition abso
lutely guaranteed both gold and silver can Le
salely utilized upon equal terms in the adjust
ment of our currency.
"'In dealing with this subject no selfish
scheme should be allowed to intervene and
no doubtful experim(ent should be attempted.
The wants of our people arl.ing from the defi
ciency or imperfect distributlol of mlonoy cir
culation ought to be fully and honestly rccox
nized and elfciently remondlot It should,
however, be constantly remembered that the
inconvenience or loss that might arise from
such a situation can be much more easily
borne than the universal distress which must
follow a discredited currency. "
This is the national democratic doc
trine to-day; and it will remain so
until the democratic party in national
convention sees fit to modify or change
it. Its strong affirmation by the Ohio
democracy indicates that it will not bhe
essentially changed at the next assem
bling of the national democracy.--Ue

THE REPUBLICAN MISTAKE. r
DefeatedC by Their Insane Force Bill Issue
In 1892.
Chairman Manley of the national re
publican executive committee ex
presses with candor the opinion that
his party made a great mistake about
the force bill issue, and should have
dropped it eight years before they did.
This is retrospective tand historical,
but it is interesting and undoubtedly
true. We imagine Mr. Manley saysno
more thian his former chieftain, the
lion. James U. Blaine, vou^l say if he
were living now, or would have said
with entire frankness if questioned on
the subject at any time within four
years before his death.
We believe, furthermore, that the re
mark of Mr. Manley expresses the
present convictions of lion. Thomas i.
Reed on the subject. The force bill
issue in 1802 was primarily and pe
culiarly the. creation of 'cen. Hlarrison,
and it defeated him and elected Mr.
Cleveland.
There is no probability that the
democratic campaign of 189l, whoever
the republican candidate may be, will
turn on the issue of federal interfer
ence in elections and negro domina
tion in the south.
The disappearance of that issue from
American politics was the greatcst if
not the only important result of the
democratic victory three years ago
next Novembcr.-N. Y. Sun.
- Gov. lMcLKinley prophesies that
the majority by whicih he was elccted
in the year of the great political Innd
slide "w-ill not be materially decreased"'
in the Ohio election this fall. l'rcdic
tions of this sort may be expected all
around. Rut with republican politi
cians generally it will be nothing more
than whistling to keep their courage
up. The fact is that the world has
moved fast and far since November.
1894, and the conditions have alto
gether changed. That was a time of
depression. low wages, poverty---a re
publican year. This is a time of busi
ness revival, of rising wages, of com
fort and hope-a democratic year.

TH_ DEMOCRATIC NEED.
Wise Leadership xeee.4ry to the sucess
of the Party
the Ph!il-delphia Telegraph seeks to
deny tuci t3d liberals itn England and
the democrats iii this aortatry the hops
which the World found for thnra in thte
alterrnate defeats and triumphs of the
past thirty years. It says that:
'"'rho .ipfiing of the electorate of the
United Stases agatinst the democratic congress
last year was for causO, and tlsat canu; still
exists in the vicious and injurious legislation,
hot inly in that which was effected but in that
which was atte.pted, of the last congress
The neople rwho have suffered so greatly bo
cause of the acts and the attempts of the late
democratic majority in congress. and who are
still suflerinr bccause of them, are not likely
to forget what party it was that inflicted the
long-continued distress upn themn"
So every uprising in the past result
ing in a defeat of the party in power
has been for cause or supposed cause,
but this has not prevented the swing of
the political pendulum just as far in
the opposite direction within two or
four years.
Thle people's dissatisfaction with the
last C≈Ωtr'ess was not with the princi
pal acts of legi.slation, but with the
delay and faithlessness in some impor
tant particulars that marked the naction
of the entate. The surrender to the
sugar trust and the "hold-up" of tile
Wilson bill by the sugar, iron, coal
and transportation rings, angered the
democratic voters, snd justly. But the
:it:!;ortnuit extension of the free list
and the reduction of duties on the nec
essaries of the people met the hearty
approval of the great popular majori
ties that condemned MecKinleyism in
1900 and again in 1892.
The "long-continued distress" of the
people was not occasioned by anything
whichi the democratic congress did or
attempte,. 'That distress was caused
by the impairment of ublic confidence
in our currency under the operation of
the republican .lvcr-purchase act.
The foundation of a restored confidence
was laid when the democratic congress
and udminiistration forced a repeal of
this nmischief-working law. The recov
cry was slow, as all recoveries from
such panicas and depressions are slow,
but it canme in due time.
'i'That no injury was worked to any
legitimate bu.siness interest by the
partial measure of tariff reform final
ly adopted is abundantly proved by the
present condition of all the great in
dustries Agriculture, manufactures,
traffic and commerce are all thriving.
Prices and wages have ad anced, the
volume of business has steadily in
creased and the high tide of prosperity.
has enveloped the land. The republic
ans are silenced. They have no
policy. All the conditions exist for a
popular reaction in favor of the demo
crats. Only wise leadership is needed
to cause history to repeat itself in
another swing of the pendulum. For
the party's and the country's sake it is
to be regretted that the leadership is
not yet equal to the opportunity.-N.
Y. World.
