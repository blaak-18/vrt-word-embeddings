To the People of the Par
ish of Natchitoches.
Thle Parish Executive Committee of
the People's Party, in view of the ex
traordinary 'events now transpiring,
and the outrages now being perpetra
ted in this parish, deem it proper to
furnish the public with a candid state
ment of the facts, and to give iis
counsel to the voters of our party in
this hour of peril and persecution.
The measures resorted to by the op
position to carry the approaching
election, eclipse anything of the kind
that has yet shocked the American
mind. It is no less an outrage than
the indiscriminate arrest of our prom
inent and influential citizens upon ad
mitted false accusations. The ob
ject of their arrests is apparent to
every candid mind. The proximity
to the election; the avowed purpose
of tihe Marshal to arrest two hundred
citizens; the great display and par.
ade made of Military forces; the un
usual rigor with which persons are
treated after arrest; the refusal of the
oficer to produce the prisoners be
fore one of two U. 8. Commissioners
residing here, for examination, upon
demand of counsel and orders ofthe
Commissioners, the authority of the
Commissioners not being questioned;
and above all, the entire and admit
ted innocence of the parties in arrest,
(for all the leading Republicans here,
admit that the prisoners had nao con
nection or knowledge or participation
in the Coushatta affair) establish be
yond cavil that the sole object of
these proceedings is to deprive our
people of their influence and vote in
the approaching election. The Deputy
Marshal accompanied by a company
of U. S. Cavalry arrived on Monday.
During that and Tuesday succeeding,
they occupied themselves by riding
through the dusty streets and search
ing houses. Among the latter the
residence of two widows, the Mistres
ses Bossier, with whom no person had
resided for a year. The efforts of
these two days resulted in the arrest
of Mr. Jae. . . Cosgrove, Editor of
the Natchitoelhee Vidicator, charged
with "conspiracy and murder" In the
Coushatta affair, but really for his
manly and independant conduct in
exposing the wicked and corrupt acts
of the dominant party in this parish.
On Wednesday night a raid up the riv
er brought to camp Capt. L. N. Lane,
Col. W. W. Breazeale, and Messrs.
Lowe and lMartia, all planters,
some of whom represent large
interests, and not one of whom was
convected in the remotest way with
the. Conshatta affair. Their ,real
crimes in the eyes of those that so
sh4mefully persecute them, are their
good standing as citizens, and their
influence among the masses, especial
ly with the negroes in their employ,
and the consequent dread of their
power on the day of the election. It
would be an easy task for either of
these gentlemen to establish before
one of the Commissioners here, 'their
entire innoceneeof thheq ges against
them had they an opportunity to do so,
but this opporganity is denied tlhem,
nId they sre tp be held in custody
until the workis finishebad-theelection
over--and then taken to New Orleans
to go through the farce of a trial.
Other fact. are not wintisg in 4p
tablshing theconspiracy., o deper ve
out people of their. dearst righ '
The Deputy. Marshall hq cqjnqs
amongst uas oetenasibly to egecute the
process of U. 8. courts, devotes a
part of one day, to an inspection of
the books of registration, and to-day
it is announced that he. will addres
a m~eting, of his part v on the assuwes
of the day. Thus9 it is seop he;pgo
coeds straight.!forward to Iis.w ork
not even disguiing ,ip any pluesibl9
wny his maai purposae. ccording teo
js own statemeats, ,ften.;times wa
petted, there i. little doubt that.on
the day of the election he will hlave
aorted tbe eustody of two hundred
of oar citien.s who will be thus de
pr"red of ctr otes. What are the
people of Natchitoehes parish donap
that they should thus be broken- up

thbfetho olitiealr eailisagn, n that
monvement waiject& d agailst the
confinsation oC their estatem, and the
extortious of the official plunderers
in this parish. A parrish tax of 64
mills was illegally levied and being
collected. There was no relief in the
courts. The people came togethler
ill mass meeting and the honest in.
dignation of the whole people, black
and white-republican and democrat,
put a stop to the wrongs of which
they complained. It was not vio
lence, disorder, nor lawlessness; it
was the touch of honest indignation
and th8 will of wronged thousands,
that produced the result. This ac
tion of our people was sustained even
by the Radical adminstration itself.
The Auditor said "the parish taxes
are illegal and appalling." Kellogg
said "investigate and report, I am nat
isfied there is wrong up there" and the
Auditor made a writen report con
demning the parochial administration.
Assistant Att'y General Dibble said
in an elaborate opinion "the parish
taxes are illegal and there must be
fraud at the bottomn of it."
Orders were issued requiring the
collector of taxes to restrict his col
lections, to the legal rate 141 mills for
any and all parochial purposes. The
Supreme Court said "there had been
great dereliction of duty on the part
of parish officers, and that parish of
ficers paid no attention to the law."
These are the facts connected with
the conduct of this people during the
past few months and for which they
are now branded as Ku-Klux, White
Leaguers, &c. For this they are to
be arrested, and outraged on the eve
of an election and thus deprived of
their only means of obtaining an hon
est parochial government-the ballot,
The charges have been trumped, up
without the shadow of truth or even
plausible pretext. Leading Republi
cans here admit thadt the whole pro
ceeding is for political purposes and
an outrage upon all law and justice.
Not only are the white people to be
arrested and intimidated, but the no
groes are to be forced to come out
and vote by threats, and even violence.
Such are some of the outrages
weakly portrayed, that now, challenge
our fortitude. More, no doubt,.re
nain in store for you.. It is, inin all
i.uma n probability the. wish and desire
of the conspiritors that your will, put
of despair, and smprting under the
wrongs and indignities heaped upon
you, resort to resistance even against
the U. S. army in your midst. Such
a collision wonld be heralded over
the North to stay the tide now set so
strongly against our unfortunate con
dition. We admonish you to forbear
ence and fortitude. The great Ame
rican heart is right andyour sufferings
and imprisonment , will call down
upon the heads of .those that violate
your liberties for politiceal ,purposes,
the indignation of tihe honest masses
of the great States of Pennsylvania
andrNew York in November, and then
the day of yoar deliverance will surely
come. Let noman fly from tha threat
uened arrests. Abate not· a single ef
fort to, obtain your rights at the
polls. Stand together against this
lastassanlt upon puor patiiotism and
manhood, as you have. hitherto stood
against spoliation mand robbery, and
you cannot fail of success. The rot
tueess of the party in power in this
State cannotalways be supported by
srmies, Unity ofpurpose and unity
of action are sow more imperative
ithan ever before. Lot;noman fail to
dhis wh'le duty in such a crisis.

The, Truth.
We clip the following from the Lo.
siaa Stlate RegiU±er, a staunch and
fearless liepublican Journal. It truth
fully says:
"We read a great deal in the North
ern paper about the murder of Nortlh
err men in the South, and we fre
quently hear the remarks that if the
democrats were in office in Louisiana,
a Northern man, and especially a
Northern republican could not remain
alive in the State. The Cousdatta
murders are referred to as a very ag
gravated instance of Southern hostili
ties to Northern men. The flourish
ing condition of Coushatta is duly
referred to as evidence of Northern
thrift and enterprise; The other side
of this Coushatta tragedy has never
been told. lied river parish, of which
this town was the seat of Justice, is
a new parish, created .by the Legis
lature since the State was reconstruct
ed. There was no object in creating
this new parish, except to increase
offices and give certain republicans a
sort of patrimony, inhabited chiefly
by colored people, that could be man
aged and taxed in the interest of the
office holders. The people who own
the lands and pay the taxes in Red
river parish, never desired the crea
tion of the parish. It was done with
out their consent and against their
wishes,. Of course a half dozen or so
of men with a parish, comparatively
wealthy, under their own control,
where they could assess taxes, collect
and expend them as they pleased,
could soon build a Court House,
School houses, buy farms, erect mills
and generally do a thriving business.
It has been stated in the papers that
the taxes in this parish were eight
hundred per cent higher than in the
adjoining parish of Natchitoches.
This statement has never been'con
tradicted to our knowledge. It was
also told to the writer .by a planter
of the parish that we believe reliable
and whose name can be had for the
asking. .The men who were mana
ging matters in this waY were mur.
dered. Were they killed because
they were Northern men I This crea
tion of new parishes for corrupt pur
poses does not work well. Grant
parish was created for the same pur
poses as Red river. The seeds sown
in corruption have in both cases
brought a harvest of murder, in
which several men of Northern birth
were victims, but they did not die for.
that reason. We imagine, if the
democrats were to get into power in
this' State, that considerable many
Northern men would leave it very
shortly, but we do not believe that
any Northern man, who has been
faithful as an officer, or useful and
reputable as a citizen, that would be
compelled or expected to leave the
State. This article is not written by
any ex-federal soldier;' tho has gone
to the democracy, or who has any
desire to see thema in office, but by
one who has edited a republican pa
per 'nthe'State since its reconstrue
then. If he has ever failed to give
the democracy and its villainies their
jpst deserts, it must be attributed
rather to a lack of capacity than in
dination. We live here, and we are
tired of seeing the people who are
our neighbors, maligned and lied
about by a set of newspaper scaveun
gers, whose only object is to make
the republican party of the North toe
the chalk mark, by reciting the terri.
ble treatment of men from the North
by the Southern rebels. A Northern
maw, who proposes to make n honest
living in Louisiana without office, can
live here withdout being disturbed, al
though he is as radical as Ben But
ler. If bhi ambition is an offei and
he prostitutes that to his own gain,
he is pretty imre not only to enjoy
the eanes of the rebels, but of every
decent Northern man in the State.

The letter bellow, taken f~otn
the New York Seu, was written to a
friend by a captain in the service of
of the U. S. Let any one ask the of
ficers stationed here at this time if
they cannot corroborate the truth of
the statement therein contained. Let
it be remembered that S. B. Packard,
is chairman of the State Central Ex
ecutive Committee of the Republican
party of this State :
Oct. 5, 1874.--I am more than glad
that I amt not down there (Louisiana)
during the present state of affairs.
God help the poor people of that un
fortunate State. He is the only one
that can give her any aid. Congress
refuses to help her and the President
is trying to place the whole country
in arms against her. I see by the
papers that Packard, the United
States Marshal and Gen. Emory, the
officer in command of the Department
of the Gulf, are both out in a false
card, because I know of my own
knowledge that my own company and
I in conmmanud of it, have been order
ed on duty for just such purposes.
itnt, thank fortune, I had some dis
cretion allowed in the matter, and
instead of helping the thieving, lying
rascals, whose only intention is to
rob hoth the blacks and whites, I
was always able to help the people of
the State, I would not be happy uu
til Kellogg, Packard and his crew
were hung to the lamp-poste in New
Orleans. The carpet-baggers have
robbed the people to such an extent
that it is almost next to impossible
for a man to exist there. I am only
one of the officers of the--Infantry,
but the whole regiment from the Colo
nel down, feel just as I do about the
matter, and if we hear of any more
cards from Emory, or any one else,
about the non-use of troops for poli.
tical purposes, we will all sign a card
that from the time the regiment went
into the State till it left it, we were
used as a means to overawe the peo
in behalf of Kellogg and his thieves.
Killed by His Own Invention.
A Franklin, Ky., paper tells us of
an old colored mani who invented a
wagon so arranged that, after being
set in motion, it runs itself by virtue
of the fact that the weight of gravita
tion is thrown forward of the center
motion, and consequently the machine
is compelled to run. It has been the
intention of the inventor to have Ihis
wagon at the fair, so that its value
might be tested publicklj, and the
old man mounted the machine, ad
justed the bands, tipped the balance.
weight over the center of motion.
gave the driving-wheel a shove, and
started for Franklin, to mport to the
Secretary of the a tion, apd have
his mnahine regularl entered on the
books. About one mite off there and
here, unfortunately, uan accident oc
curred. The machine was humming
along the smooth, sandy road at about
fifteen miles an hour, and the happy
inventor was on deck,' feeling as
prond -as Fulton 'oh board his first
steamboat, when, in making the tura
just near the margein of the Red Pood,
the starbeard front wheel collided
with a heavy-set post-oak sapling,
and the reboned wee epowerfnl that
the old man was thbown forward over
the dashboard, and was at the sase
time strack by the flange of the daiv
iug-wheul, which preeipitatedl his
rspeed so much that,5 when his helad
struck the fence patelon thie oppo
site side of the road, he was so badly
smashed that his death inust have
taken place immediately. Coroner
Hartleld's inquest was oneertain as
to whether he had-been killed by a
suddenm stroke of the driving-wheel,
or by a too hasty.. collision with the
panel of the fence. The mbachine,
after the accident, struck oat with
freedom, andi paIsing the restnce of
Capt. Lea, soon made its way acrose
Il tite ditection bf Boissea's meadow,
bat ws arrested is its progress by a
large log, which titled the balance
weight back of the centre of motion,
and the wild wagon was standing
gently at rest when overtaken by the
eorouer and his party, who were fol
lowing along to take care of the killed
od wounded. Sincee Ue tragice death
ofthe inventor, no man has dared to
mount the Iery, untamed steed, but
our informant assurire s us that it will
beoa exhibition at the fair grounds,
and we invitutheattention of inven
tors and mahiaisemeo its peculntiar

any man's ,lifo ·lso mounts it and
