in Acts 15:14, as to “how God first
looked to take out of the Gentiles a
people for His name.’’ We see that
God did not look to take out from
the Mongolians but from the Gen
tiles a people for His name.
“And the glad tidings must first be
published among all the nations.’’
(Mark 13:10). And Matthew 24:14
adds: “for a testimony.’* That this
has actually been accomplished, we
have only to cite the fact that the
English and American Bible Societies
now issue the Bible in four hundred
and twelve languages. This would
seem to largely do away with the ne
cessity for maintaining expensive
missions in foreign lands. The edu
cated heathen can read for himself
what the Christian religion will do
for him individually. Current news
and accessible means of travel will
demonstrate to him what it has done
for Christendom. Should he care to
embrace it he can do so without the
mediation of a missionary.
In this day there are but few “be
nighted heathen.’’ Commercial in
tercourse has opened their doors to
popular education. Newspapers, tele
graphs and railroads have done more
to educate them —even in technical
Christianity—than have all the mis
sionaries who have grown fat and rich
among them. Their schools are equal
to ours, and they have the same
facilities for disseminating knowl
edge that we have. And now they
have our Bible in their own tongue
to accept or reject as they see fit.
Do they seem to be in particular need
of enlightenment?
Suppose we consider another phase
of the matter, equally interesting
and rather more important:

The increasing influx into this
country of the yellow peoples and
their aggressive demands upon Amer
ican institutions, and their determin
ed fight for recognition, aided by a
few ill-advised friends and sympa
thizers, will in a few years force upon
the American people who harbor
them a race problem before which all
others with which we have been af
flicted will pale into nothingness.
Our red population has been so
decimated and so outnumbered that
the Indians are now a negligible
quantity. The blacks like the poor,
“we have always with us.’’ presenting
a many-sided, many-featured problem.
Now rises the swelling yellow flood
with a menace of ten thousand evils.

one hundred families being located
on various “railroad lands’’ all over
our country. The school question is
already troublesome; many conces
sions have been hastily made that
will be ruefully and with extreme
difficulty revoked. Our social, indus
trial, political and civil life will soon
be honeycombed and permeated com
pletely by an element inferior to the
Caucasian, but in time numerically
strong—then what? History has a
way of repeating itself, and more
than one superior people has gone
down before inferior invaders. The
mighty Goths retreated before At
tilla and his Huns; the Romans went
down before the Goths; the Visigoths
were swept out by the Saracens; the
Aztecs were conquered by the effete
Spaniards; and the flower of South
ern culture, intellect and pride fell
in the dust before the Northern van
dal horde!
It would seem that all the pages
in the book of history have been
turned, and, history must, will, re
peat itself. To sit back supinely in
Caucasian pride, wrapped in the bril
liant folds of Aryan, Gothic and An
glo-Saxon greatness, will hardly serve
to prevent a shameful amalgamation
or a bloody extermination.
The yellow peril is no phantasy.
Mongolian races in our country
have the advantage over the black
because of color prejudice, therefore
the former come closer to us, hence

SOCIALISM By Thos. E. Watson
“And this disgusting book, Women Under Socialism, has been swal
lowed with a coming appetite by Europe, from whence the New York So
cialists have imported it to the United States—a nasty book that fans every
prurient passion, offers temptation to every demon of class-hatred and indi
vidual covetousness!
.“Stated with simplicity and directness, Herr Bebel’s appeal to op
pressed women is this —You are enslaved. Marriage as we now know it is a
failure. It was established by capitalists in order that private property might
be inherited and perpetuated,” is one of the many uncompromising and un
equivocal paragraphs which occur. Every grown man and woman should
read a description of the Herron Wedding.

assimilation and amalgamation with
them are more probable, more possi
ble. The Mongolian is more vicious,
more depraved, more cunning than
the black by reason of his superior
intelligence, therefore a really great
er menace. Our color prejudice will
ever serve to protect us from the
blacks, but we have not this protec
tion from the aggressive, ambitious,
insinuating Mongolian—thus he is
the greater danger—racially, indus
trially and socially.
The great Caucasian race has held
Central Europe and Southern Asia in
segregation for centuries before it
overflowed into America; it left-the
blacks in segregated possession of
Central Africa and the yellows in
Eastern Asia. Is it possible now that
the American overflow must share
territory, rights and sacred privilege
with the inferiors that Europe locked
out? Is America to be the battle
ground now of a tripartite racial
conflict that will involve the purity
of the Caucasian race and turn this
continent over to a mongrel breed
that will lose all it were best to keep?
Can’t you see it coming? Can’t you
feel it in the air? “Will it be the
next week or the next year?” Or
do you comfort yourself with the
fact of present small, inconsequen
tial numbers? To prove how great
a matter a little fire kindles, we have
only to consider recent conditions in
California that caused much appre
hension. Should this country ever
become involved in a war with China
or Japan we can .easily foresee the
trouble we might have with natives
of those countries now residing
among us in our cities, towns, vil
lages, and, worst of all, with their
colonies of several hundred families

NOS. 8561-8559—CHARMING MODE
FOR A YOUNG GIRL.
A simple blue and white dotted linen
was used in the development of this
attractive model. The blouse waist is
laid in a deep tuck over the shoulder
in Gibson style and is unusually chic
and becoming. The low Dutch collar
and turned back cuffs are finished by a
narrow frill of sheer white lawn, head
ed by a band of insertion. The skirt is
an excellent two-piece model, closing in
either front or back. The pattern is
cut in three sizes: 14-16-18 years. The
sixteen-year size requires 1 % yards of
44-inch material for the waist, and 3
yards for the skirt.
This pattern consists of a waist and
skirt and will be mailed to any address
on receipt of 10 cents for each, in
stamps or silver.

And, for how much of this condi
tion that confronts us are foreign
missions directly and indirectly re
sponsible?
It is well to look into all these
questions that the Jeffersonians give
us a chance to discuss. If those of
us who do consider them are too few
in numbers even to stem the tide of
wrong with vote and work, we can
at least, by reason of our studious
consideration, Tfe somewhat pre
pared for the storm when it does
break, and so “hunt cover.”
There is not an evil in our land—
