Proposal Is Brought Up at New
York Methodist Conference —
Debate Follows
NEW YORK, April 19.—At the
125th annual meeting of the New
York Methodist conference held here
the past week, a suggestion was made
by the Rev. Dr. G. Franklin Snyder
•f Chatham. N. Y., that the church
undertake in co-operation with other
Protestant denominations the estab
lishment in three large American cit
ies of daily newspapers.
In the debate which followed. Rev.
Dr. Snyder had the following to say:
“The press as a whole, Instead of
seeking to give constructive aid to
all agencies of uplift and betterment
and agencies of education and charac
ter building have a tendency to ad
versely criticize the church and her
ministers.
“Prize fighters are featured in
places of prominence as having en
gaged in the greatest, battles’ of the
centuries. Space worth millions of
dollars in the aggregate is freely de
voted to the promotion of that which
debases and degrades all who have
any park in the things thus adver
tised. The liberty of the press has
long since lapsed into a mere license
to print what they please regarding
the character and conduct of any ei
whom it may please their employers
to traduce and slander.
“Why present the agencies that
make for good in the world in a false
light and the church as a moribund
society made up of a few old wo
and little children deserving the pity
or contempt or both of regular folks?
“It is true that there were organ
ized twenty-six new congregations a
day in the United States during 1922

In The Signs of The Times
We pass through no royal court,
no questioning rennue, to come to
Jesus. There is no let or hinderance
in our receiving His favor and His
grace. We do not have to buy His
help through advocates. There is no
one standing in the way between us
and Jesus.
He is our priest. He stands in the
sanctuary of heaven, before the
throne of God, offering the perfect
sacrifice of His blood for the for
giveness of our sins, and, bestowing
the free pardon of His Father upon
those who come to Him in faith. He
will not leave His office and duty of
High Priest so long as there remaim
upon earth one man who seeks for
giveness and perfection through His
name.
He is our advocate, our lawyer.
He stands in the court of the great
Judge, whose law has been broken by
us times without number. Burhe
has a perfect case; for in the place
of our sinfulness, He is able to put
His own sinlessness; in the place ot
our evil nature, His righteous char
acter. He never pleads before the
Judge in vain for any who come to
God through Him. Before us He
places the loving justice of the
Father who gave His own Son to sat
isfy the law; and before Him He
places the adoration and the service
of those children of men whom He
has redeemed.
He is <*ur friend. He has felt the
pains of life; He has known the hun
ger and the weariness of human flesh;
He has met the fierce assaults of
passion in His own mind and body;
He has wept with sorrow as he has
also laughed with joy. Our needs, our
aspirations are familiar to Him as
they could never be to highest arch
angel or holiday saint or dearest
mother. He seeks our companion
ship; He desires to walk and talk
with us; and to crown us finnally
with the noblest attributes of the
divine and human Christ.
There is no one between us and
Jesus. Let us therefore, with con
fidence and certain hopes, come to
Him, and He will in nowise cast us
out.
Every Klansman, as a voter,
exercises a public trust. He dare
not vote for himself alone; he
dare not choose for himself only.
He must vote for the benefit of
the entire commonwealth, and
that is why his choice must be
governed by sound principles of
selection.

Exclusion Vote It Congress*
Reply to Japan Note—
Dawes Plan O. K.’d.
By EDWARD W. PICKARD
JAPAN’S effort to dictate America’s
Immigration policy has resulted, so
far, very unfortunately for Japan.
Ambassador Hanlhnra’s warning that
adoption of the exclusion clause In
the Johnson bill would have “grave
consequences” was considered imper
tinent und Insulting hy congress. There
fore after the house had pnssed the
measure by a vote of 322 to 71, the
senate set Its face sternly and voted
unanimously In favor of that clause
which provides for the exclusion of
Japanese Immigrants from the United
States.
The administration, through Secre
tary of State Hughes, Is on record as
opposed to this clause and In favor of
extending the quota limitation to
Japan with the “gentlemen’s agree
ment" retained. But In view of the
unanimity of opinion In congress It Is
held by many In Washington that Pres
ident Coolldge scarcely can afford to
veto the measure. On the other hand,
all the pacifist organizations In the
country have Jumped to the front with
demands that Mr. Coolldge put the
mark of his disapproval on the legis
lation. Jane Addains, Amy Woods,
Arthur Peering Call and other spokes
men for these associations urged that
the bill would be a distinct setback to
the cause of amity among nations.
Since It has become known that the
Russian Reds have been working
through some of these peace organiza
tions to break down our national de
fense and our form of government,
their Influence has declined. Still It
may be that the sennte, having given
full expression to Its resentment
against the Japanese attempt to Inter
fere with our legislation, will decide
to modify Its stand when It comes to
the passage of the Immigration bill as
a whole. Not, however, In deference
to the views of the pacificists and
pinks.
The Japanese government and peo
ple are naturally disgruntled and dis
turbed. The Jingo press over there 1b
demanding the resignation of the min
istry and even hinting at war with
America.. Already a campaign has
been started for a trade boycott on
the state of California If the exclusion
measure Is finally adopted. The gov
ernment Insists there shall he no re
taliatory measures and Is said to be
ready to ask the League of Nations
conference at Brussels on July 23 to
approve a new International Immigra
tion basis. In America the question is
looked on as being one of the admis
sion or exclusion of Immigrants un
desirable economically. In Japan It
Is considered a question of race equal
ity, and the Japanese feel that they
are undervalued and insulted.
Possibility of war with Japan is of
course remote, but the controversy Is
being utilized by both those who ad
vocate the strengthening of our de
fenses and those who urge that we
abandon the Philippine islands before
they are taken away from us by Ja
pan—as they easily could he under
present conditions.
HAVING been approved by the rep
arations commission and by the
British government and accepted by
the Gerrann government ns a basis
for settlement, the fate of the Dawes
report seems now to rest with France.
The other countries invt»lved are al
most certain to give the plan their ap
proval. Prime Minister MacDonald
announced In the house of commons
hls government's full and unreserved
acceptance of the report and said it
would urge all the other governments
concerned to take the same course.
Mr. Baldwin assured him that In this
he had the support of the whole Brit
ish people. Chancellor Marx called
the presidents of all the German states
to conference In Berlin and ufter a
warm discussion the cahlnet formally
accepted the Invitation of the repara
rlona commission to adhere to the
9 ,m M - ■ m
. . M ib m PBPV ■%■■■■■ A
lIUULftILLI I Lr
Dawes plan. The German reply makes
no reservations and says the govern
ment “Is ready to assure Its co-opem
tlon In the experts' plan." Marx after
ward said Germany would expect "com
plete and unrestricted disposal over
the whole relch territory within the
boundaries set by the treaty of Ver
sailles," and suggested that fulfillment
of the report would be endangered if
“the immediate threat of disturbing In
terference" continues to exist.
“Oppressive and peremptory guar
antees for the fulfillment of the plan's
provisions are demanded from Ger
many, and they will be granted," Herr
Marx said, adding, “hence I deem It
not Improper If Germany wants to see
that It will not be threatened with
military Interventions which, even with
the best of Intentions of fulfillment,
would form a serious hindrance to an
attempt to convert the plan Into
deeds.”
Premier Poincare In a public‘speech
virtually declared France would hold
on to the Ruhr and the Ruhr guaran
tees until the experts’ plan Is execut
ed. French officials feel that the al
lies must reach an agreement on
France’s security before the Dawes
plan Is accepted, and that all the al
lies should agree upon the measures
to be taken by them If Germany de
faults again on Its obligations. Poin
care, It is thought, will demand the
continuance of the operation and con
trol of the railroads In the occupied
zones until military necessities are
protected and a certain number of pay
ments are made.
British officialdom was worried hy
the nttltude of Poincare and It was
said Mr. MacDonald warned the
French ambassador that Its main
tenance would endanger the continu
ance of the entente. Probably France
will acquiesce after the demands of
domestic politics have been satisfied.
One thing that Is worrying the
French Is the fear that they will lose
the full fruits of the Dawes plan by
a nation-wide German plot to cut down
the proposed revenues to the allies by
ceasing the use of tobacco and beer
and reducing to the minimum the con
sumption of sugar and matches.
DEMOCRATS and insurgent Repub
licans in the senate are still
seething with something like Indigna
tion over the rebuke administered by
President Coolidge for the manner in
which the Investigation of the Internal
revenue bureau is being conducted and
for the resolution of the committee to
employ Francis J. Heney as Investiga
tor at the expense of Senator Couzens
of Michigan. The President agrees
with the secretary of the treasury that
the Investigators are devoting them
selves mainly to efforts to implicate in
tax dodging the concerns in wulch Mr.
Mellon Is interested, and soys the hir
ing of Heney was Improper. Hls ad
monition to the senators to conduct
their Investigations In accord with
constitutional guarantees aroused re
sentment. and all through last week
there were hot debates on the subject
between the Democratic and insurgent
leaders and the Republicans who sup
port the administration. Governor
Pinchot admits he suggested to Sena
tor Couzens the employing of Heney
and defends It. Couzens was 111 and
the work of the committee was sus
pended.
Attorney general stone, it
Is said, has carefully examined
the evidence tt|>on which Senator
Wheeler of Montana was Indicted In
Great Falls and has found the action
of the grand Jury was Justified. De
partment of Justice officials say the
evidence was turned up by chance
while investigators were working up
cases of violations of the postal laws,
and the United States district attorney
in Montana acted without any sugges
tion from Washington.
Among the witnesses heard by the
Daugherty Investigating committee
last week was the delectable Gaston
B. Means again. He told a story of
how the late Jess Smith had collected
at least $250,000 from bootleggers and
had split with the former attorney
general. He Informed the committee
that tiie night before Smith's mysteri
ous death In the Daugherty apartment
In Washington he naked Means to re
turn a large sum of money to New
York bootleggers, who were threaten
ing exposure and to whom Howard
Mannlngton already had returned 930.-
000. Menus also raid Secretary Mel
lon had a contract to give liquor per
mits to “the Green River whisky
crowd,” and declared he had found
enough evidence in the Bosch MHgn< to
eune to call for the indictment of for
mer Attorney General A. Mitchell Pal
mer, and timt Daugherty and Jess
Smith had decided that it would be
better to hold this over Palmer's head
to influence Democratic votes in con
gress than to bring prosecution.
George \V. Storek of the Department
of Justice gave evidence tending to
implicate Francis B. Harrison in scan
dals, and the committee then took a
recess to permit Senator Wheeler to
attend the sessions of the committee
that Is investigating the circumstances
surrounding Ids indictment.
PRESIDENT COOI.IDGE suys steps
shoulu be taken by the federal gov
ernment to put outdoor recreational
opportunities within the grasp of all
the people, and himself takes the first
of such steps hy appointing Secre
taries Weeks, Work. Wallace and
Hoover and Assistant Secretary Roose
velt a committee to promulgate “a na
tional policy which should not merely
co-ordinate under federal guidance ul)
activities In behalf of outdoor recrea
tion but also formulate a program to
serve as a guide for future action."
WITH considerable publicity the
conference between British and
Russian representatives for the re
establishment of trade und political
relations opened in London last week.
Almost before It got under way there
were Indications that it might come
to naught. Prime Minister MncDonald
opened the proceedings with a polite
speech in which he warned the Rus
sians that If they desired credits —
which Is what they do desire —they
must make It plain that they are
ready to respect their contractual ob
ligations, and that the one way to do
this was to keep their old contracts.
He warned them further that Britain
would not stand for subversive propa
ganda anywhere in the empire. The
Russian delegates were conciliatory,
but in two days the conference ad
journed over the Easter holidays with
the gentlemen from Moscow in doubt
as to what to do. For meanwhile two
of their chieftains at home, Zinovleff,
president of the Third Internationale,
and Trotzky, minister of war, had
come out with violent attacks on Mac-
Donald. Both of them assert that
Russia will not meet the claims put
forward by the British and that an
agreement Is possible only If both
countries si rt with a clean slate,
after which ine soviet government will
meet any obligations the Russian dele
gation may sign at the London con
ference. .
OCR army’s globe-encircling avia
tors have been having some ex
citing exi*erlences up in Alaska, which
culminated In the forced landing of
the plane piloted by Major Martin,
commander of the squadron. A crack
in the crank case compelled him to
descend at Cape Igvak and the other
planes proceeded to Chlgnlg, 170 miles
further west. Word of the mishap
was sent out from there and two de
stroyers hurried to the rescue of Mar
tin and his mechanician, who were
found safe In an Inlet and were taken
to Kanatak where a new engine wus
to be installed.
NEW YORK’S two state conventions
were interesting because for the
Republicans Secretary Hughes deliv
ered the keynote speech and gave un
stinted praise to President Cooildge,
while at the Democratic gathering
Oov. Al Smith was formally put In the
running for the presidential nomina
tion. This was done through the
adoption of a resolution presented by
three leading women, and In response
Smith agreed to make the race.

Punishing Judges
Judges sometimes do their duty.
When they do, there is frequently an
attempt at the ballot box to punish
them. This is an unfortunate Ameri
can practice. It shows that we still
have some distance to go before we
acquire perfect poise and judgment
One of America's greatest lawyers.
Horace Binney, wrote a philippic
against the slaughter of judges who
tried to do their duty. Among other
things he said, "We are now under
the direction of a fearful mandate,
which compels judges to enter the
arena of a popular election for their
offices. That puts a cord around the
neck of every one of them during the
whole term of office.” Horace had an
idea that judges should go on the
bench under good behavior, of course
for life. And maybe he was right.
His word didn’t travel very far, and
his voice, echoing down the corridor
of sixty years, is not listened to or
even heard.
Shall we go on scaring the judges,
making them believe that if they de
cide rightly and justly we shall take
them out and why them? Shall we
go on playing to our baser ideas and
put an extra hoodwink over the eyes
of Justice? How shall we treat the
judges who are deciding law inter
preting the people’s united con
science as they think best?

hojd itself to be especially qualified
to dictate just how the various cur

matters to those who are experts and

cles out of the way of educators who
are trying to make progress in spite
of the limitations that are thrown
about the free school by selfish poli
ticians and papal schemers. And it

Social Selection Also Necessary
We stand to idolize education, ffe
are fond of ascribing to it a kind of
unlimited virtue. But social selec
tion is also necessary, and KlanwnerA
should work to enforce or at luaat.
to promulgate its essential laws, ad -
ding the task to a program that
already rather full. There is no oth
er way. Instinctive criminals and im
beciles are not benefited greatly by
education. Education can not make?
such refuse from the temple fit par
ents; nor can it remove tne taint of
vice or purify the blood.
Unfortunately our greatest danger*
in the past have come to us through
vicious and diseased aliens, imported
almost as carelessly as cattle. Edu
cation of our sort can not teach this
degenerate strain. Someone has
pointed out that a high stone wall
'with sharp spikes on top is as nec
essary a means of grace to defective*-
as hymns are for normal people.” *
Quite so. A microcephalous idiot can
not be taught to be a good mother by
the public school; neither can a cre
tin be changed into a good citizen by
FroebeTs “gifts.”
The other day a lawyer pointed out
to us a slouching man and woman,
dragging four or five small children
across a street in a little Indiana,
city. “Imbeciles.” he said shortfjr.
“A charge to town, county and state.*"
Unscientific philanthropy toward.'
these people is not a blessing. It is
a cruelty. A notch above this cla**
is the lazy degenerate.
It is said that at the beginning of
winter certain Klansmen suggested
to a worthless individual that he keep
his woodshed filled with wood pre
pared for the stove over which faiv
unfortunate wife spent much of he»
time when she was not at the wash
tub. The suggestion was heeded. The
man worked for the first time Ur
years. But all “social condition*’'
can not be thus easily managed, and.
there is a man-sized job in front of
every American citizen. Keeping tb*-
racial stock as free as possible--free
from the “ taint European”- is tb%
first big step to take toward reducing-;
social trouble.
