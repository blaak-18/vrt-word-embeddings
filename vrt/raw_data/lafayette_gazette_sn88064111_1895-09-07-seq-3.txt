The Original Editor.
Canton Sunday Herald.
Is a man's editorial ability to be
measured by the scrupulous cleanli
ness of his desk ? Strange as it
may seem, I am inclined to think
that in the inverse ratio of the tidi
ness, the greater the ability. When
I see a man claiming superior abil
ity as an editor, I have an innate
desire to see his desk. I would not
give the snap of my fingers for the
effusions of a man who has his pen
cil sharpened just so, his paper laid
at a precise angle, and everything in
and about the establishment in ap
ple pie order. That man cannot
think orignally. What he writes he
borrows. He uses his scissors of
tener than his pencil.
If I find the desk topsy turvy, a
dozen pencils in all stages of sharp
ening, exchanges scattered to the
four winds, blank paper in plenty,
and in all degrees of pencilhood,
with the man at the desk unkempt
and unshaven I'd give more for one
column of that fellow's stuff than
all of the studied periods and scis
sored articles of your tidy editor
for a year. My unkempt genius is
original. He thinks thoughts. His
soul is above blackened shoes and a
clean collar. His editorials are
read. The tidy editor's scanned.
One becomes famous, the other is
buried in his own pastepot of obli
vion.
Mrs. E. E. Davis, of San Miguel,
Cal. says: "I am trying in a
measure to repay the manufacturers
of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
for the great good their remedy has
done me. For years I was a con
stant sufferer fromnt weak lungs and
bronchial asthma. My rest at
night was disturbed by a hacking
cough, so that I felt miserable the
greater part of my time. Many
remedies recommended by my
friends, were tried, none of which
proved suitable to my case. I did
not experience any beneficial results
until I began taking Chamberlain's
Cough Rmnedy. After two bottles
of the large size have been u'ed I
am pleased to state, my health is
better than it has been for years.
The sozeness has left my lungs
and chest and I can breathe easily
It has done me so much good that
I want all who are sufferering from
lung troubles, as I was, to give it a
trial." For sale by all druiht,

Pursuant to the announcement
made in the local papers the district
convention of the WV. C. T. U. con
vened in Falk's Opera House
Wednesday night. In the opening
ceremonies were included a concert
by the local talent ably assisted by
Miss Anna Grant, of New Iberia.
There was a good attendance of the
people of the town and vicinity.
To the delegates from the societies
of the neighboring towns, who had
arrived during the day Mayor A.
J. Moss extended a hearty wel
come. He said:
Ladies of the Woman's Ch/ristian
Temrpeeance Union:
As mayor of Lafayette and on
behalf of our people and the friends
of your cause, I have the pleasure
and the honor of tendering to you a
most hearty welcome to our city.
In all civilized countries, woman
is ever foremost in works of charity,
morality and religion. She is the
true and devoted f.iend to human
ity. A mother, wife, sister, daugh
ter, friend, she is the guardian an
gel of man. Without her and her
noble influences, this would be a
dreary world indeed.
The Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union is a large and influen
tial organization and is credited
with accomplishing a wonderful
amount of good. May your dis
trict convention prove successful
beyond your most sanguine expect
tations.
I hope your visit to our city will
be profitable to the Union, and I
trust that each one of you will en
joy your stay among us and take
away with you pleasant memories of
Lafayette.
At conclusion of Judge Moss' ad
dress Mrs. Creighton Walhs, presi
dent of the Lafayette society, wel
comed the visiting ladies in appro
priate words. Mrs. Roller, a prom
inent worker in the temperance
cause, responded for the visitors.
The audience was then treated to
some excellent singing by Miss
Anna Grant and Messrs. Laberge
and VanderCruyssen and to choice
musical selections by Miss Jaufroid
and Messrs. Vander Cruyssen, La
berge, Campbell and Jennaro.
Miss Zerelda Bailey accompanied
Messrs. Vander Crussen and La
berge on the pianio. This is the
first time the people of Lafayette
have had an opportunity to listen to
Miss Grant. This charming young
lady posseses a voice of great sweet
ness. She sang with the greatest
ease and much effect. Her soft
and silvery voice poured forth sweet
and tender notes with such delicacy
and taste that even the unmusi:.al
ear drank in the melodious sounds
with breathless attention. The
Gazette compliments the ladies of
the IV. C. T. U. in having brought
to Lafayette such a sweet singer.

A correspondent of the Lafa
yette Advertiser in its last issue
submits the name of Mr. L. G.
Stelly, of Carencro, a prominent
and influential farmer of our ward,
as a suitable candidate for repre
sentative. The suggestion is a good
and wise one, and the reasons sub
mitted by The Advertiser's corres
pondent in recommending Mr.
Stelly for that position, were excel
lent and to the point. We are will
ing to wager '"dollars to doughnuts"
that this ward will as usual be "'left
in the cold," but still we can have
the satisfaction of knowing that in
Mr. Stelly the parish would have a
representative, worthy and capable,
and of whom it would be proud.

The following is from The Pica
yune's "Telephone Column" of last
Sunday: "Hello Picayune! Sheriff
Broussard of Lafayette parish, was
in the city to-day, and left during
. the day for his home. Ike said that
his enemies were working hard to
defeat his re-election, and that one
candidate had been given $zooo to
make the race against him. But
Mr. Broussard declares that he can
. not be beaten and will get another
term. The reason of the opposi
s tion, he said, was the assertion,
merely, by those opposing him that
She had filled the office long enough."

the puzzle.
Miss Ruby Scranton was quite ill
this week. We are pleased to see
her up again.
Too much praise cannot be given
Mr. O. Cade, for the good work he
is doing on the public road all
along his plantation. Not only has
he worked the road at his own ex
