Who are Responsible for the Conntry's
Troubles. t
[Wash ingtot' Gaz'et t'.
The Hon. John E. Kenna, in a very s
able speech Ilast week, made striking I
and forcible points on the Radical par- 1
ty, and showed conclusively that they t
were solely responsible for the pres- I
ent condition of slTsirs in this country.
He says that the D)emocratic citizen (
may point with satisfaction to the c
proni recoid of his party on the tinan- I
cial issues; that it has opposed, and t
the Radical party had passed, all the R
menasures which have multiplied the I
wants and increased the sufferings of a
the people. On the28th of June, 1862, t
the question of concurring in the t
Senate amtendinent.to an act creating
bonds, &c.. was before the house,
and Mr. Holman, a Democrat, offered
the following provision :
Provided, That nothing in this act shall
impair the right of the States to tax the
hoods, notes, and other obligations issu
e-d under this act.
Sixty-three Democrats, all that
there was voted for the amendment.
only ei ght Repuhlicanus voted "ay,"c
alld seventy-Reveln voted "no." Thus I
Radicalism defeated in the House the
proposition to tax the bonds. n
In February, 186.3, upon the bill to I
charter National Banks in the Senate t
the I)emocrlats voted "ay" 2, and "no"
12, which was six to one against the
system. In the Senate the Radicals
voted "no" 9, and "ay" 21, constitut
ing a majority of more than two to one
in its favuor. In the House the Demo
crats voted "ay" 3, and "no" 42.t
mAlking fourteen to one against it, I
while the Radicals voted "no" 22, 4
;andt "ay" 75, making over three to
ole in its favor. Thus the Radical
partv foisted upon the country the
National Bank system. t
()n April 18, 1864, what is known Ii
'is the supplilmental National Bank
bill was before Congress. It was in
tenlded to perpetuate the system. In
the Ilouse the Democrats voted 6.5
solid "no," and the Radicals "ay" 80,
,and only one ";io." In the Senate
the I)Democrats were again solid aginstn e
it, and the Radicals "no" 2, and "ay"
30. Hence they ate responsible also i
for this objectionable act.
- In March, 184I9, when the "act to I
strengthen tile public credit," come
np for consideration, debate was cut
oftf. Nonwithstanding it declared the
currency indebtedness of the country
to be paid in coin, and added $500,
000,000 to the public debt, it was pass.
ed under the "previous question"- t
the gag law"-it was a gigantic fraud. t
On its passage Democrats "ay" only
one, and "no" 34; the Radicals otly
"no" 12, and "ay" 96. The bonds
were payable in green-backs, and this
act was to make them payable in
coin.
On March 29, 1869, Mr. Morgan, a
Democrat, offered a resolution to ex
emptsalt, tea, coffee, sugar matches,
and tobacco, and to tar the bonds.
This was defeated, Democrats solid
"ay" 39; Radicals solid "no" 104.
Again Radicalism stood by the money
power and against tl.e people.
In 1870, thil act was pending which
provided for funding the greenback
bonds into coin bonds, and which rob
lied the people of $500,000,000. On
this occasion the democrats were solid
"no" 54, and the Radicals voted "ay"'
139, with only two "noes." In July
1870, when Sherman's proposition
was penditg to increase the National
bank circulation $54,000,000, as usual
in all these aggresive measures, the
Democrats voted "aye" only 4, and
"no" 44, and the Radicals passed the
bill. On June 14, when the same bill
was pending, Hon. Samuel J. Randall,
ifered a substitute, which was pro
posed to take up tile national-bank
iotes, and issue $300.000,000 in green
backs in their stead. On this tmeas
ire the Democrats voted "no" only 6,
and "'aye" 41. The Radicals voted
"aye" only 10, and "no" 105.
At this same time Mr, Morgan, a
Democrat, offered a substitute, which
provided for the repealing the nation
al-bank act and the substutloo of
$400,000,000 in greenbacks, with full
legal tender qualities fs,r the nation
al-tank notes. The Republiaenus also
defeated this, by a vote of 116 "noes,"
to 34 Demtcrats "aye."
in 1872, the following resolation
was presented :
Resosed, That in the opinion of this
louse the Mecretary of the Treasury in
negotiating the loan authorised by the
act of July 14, 1870, has neither increas
ed the bonded debt nor incurred an ex
penditure contrary to law.
This resolntion, given empathic ap
proval to, the Radical ruinous policy,
passed the House by a strict party
vote. The Democrats voted solidly
"no," and the Radicals "aye" 110.
In 1873,' the act demonetizing silver
was passed, but not by ao "a," and
S"no" vote. The RECORD does sho4,
however, that Mr. Hooper, a Radical,

"The People we Whipped."
[N. O. Picayune.]
A correspondent of the Philadel- 1
phia Times has recently interviewed
Gen. Sherman in reference to the
army bill passed the day Lefore the
close of Congress. The report which
he gives of his conservation with the
highest officer in the military service
of the country is painfully complete.
Hle even describes, for the benefit of I
those interested in the personal ap
pearance of great men, the distin
guished chieftain's snmmer dress.
"He was busy at work, with a fan in s
one hand and a pen in the other.
Dressed in linen, with nnl marks of
of his calling except the military but
tons on his waistcoat, lie appeared to
he cooler than any of the many c
officials I have seen to-day in a some
what protracted search for news." n
But for this account we would hardly
have supposed that the General's tem
perature was so low; for the tenor of
his criticism of the army bill indicates
a man stricken with summer madness,
and barely able to act upon Paickard's a
celebrated advice to Kellogg "to
keep on his shirt." In reply to an t
inquiry as to how the bill would effect
the army, he exclaimed with profane
emphasis :
'"Oh. it. raises h--. In the first place
it prevents the use of the army to pro
tect emigrants. That posse comitatus
parts of the bill is the merest piece of
foolishness I know of. The army has
always been subordinate to the civil 8
authorities, buntI don't see, under the a
provisions of this act, how the army can
be used to suppress riots or protect the j
emigrants, unless the Presidents de
clares martial law in the excited dis
t, ict, or declare war against the par- a
ticular tribe of Indians. It is getting
so that we shall have tb opologize to
the people we we whipped. They come
here and get everything they want, for
it is easy to get such fellows as Ban
ning, whohasn't got brains enough to be
a dry goods clerk."
Gen. Sherman must have known
that he was being interviewed for the
benefit of the public, and the indecen
cy of his language is, therefore, scar
cely more glaring than, its audacity.
Further on the following passage oc
curs: a
"The law," said Gen. Sherman, speak
ing generally, 'is fall of absurdities and
nconsisteneies. The posse comitatus
part was dictated by the people whom
we have whipped, and who don't want
to see Union soldiers. The fact is, they
don't like to see the American flag among I
thein."
We do not propose to discuss in
this connection the various objections e
which Gen. Sherman urged against
those provisions of the bill which he a
considers objectionable. What im.
presses usna most, and what we desire
to call attention to just now, is the
fact that the Commanding General'of
thIe Federal Army has distinctly and a
publicly accused the people pf the
South with cherishing a malicious
purpose to cripple the eefficiency of .J
the army, anid that be has grossly in
silted a section of the country which i
is as much entitled to his respect as
New England or the Pacifio slope.
'"It is getting so that we shall have
to apologize to the people we whip
ped," says Gen. Slherman. Appar- a
ently that hero, isone of those narrow
minded ard bitter hearted manikins
who have 110ot yet realised that the
war is over. He speaks of "the peo- E
ple we whipped" as thongrh he were
talking about a foieigd baution. He I
frgete that hlie is a publia ,servant,
and not merely" the hired belly of the
Republican parr.'. No doubt he
would ind active and cobgen'al enm
ployument during tlhe apeaching

Our parish Convention' having de
clared in favor of a constitutional ''
convention, we have heard the re- d
mark several times made that this
action would have a tendency to drive R
the colored voters away from us. do
Pray why not inform us also when
have they ever known the mass of t
the colored voters to show a disposi- h
tion to affiliate with us? Abandon a th
constitutional convention simply be
cause it is displeasing to a few Re.
publicans who have not, nor ever
had the remotest idea to co-operate w
with us ! When, in the name of God
will our people cease to be socon- le
fouodedly anxious about the colored
vote. The Democratic party dares
do nothing, no policy can be adopted ; a
no fixed principles fized upon but all p
these things must be trimmed to suit e'
the idea of the colored people. If an a
honorable man and a life long Demo. a
crat is mentioned in connection with
office, up goes the warning finger and o
the fellow creeps up to you 'and in a
whisper breathes into your ear the
astonishing information he can't con
trol any niggers. Well, what if he
cannot t Is it not about the best as
surance that he can depend upon, t
and secure the support of white men,
at least. We have some colored men
in the Democratic party of this parish, L
and they are tried and true. FalseS
rumors cannot shake their faith, nor 13
will lies lessen their esteem for the
Democratic party and the men com- .
posing it. So cease this nauseating
twaddle which has become stale and
disguettng and is unworthy a great Pt
party. Pay no attention to those n
dyspeptic political trimmers who al-.
ways have an eye upon, and never p
neglect to exclaim "Digger In the e

Why Senator Stubs Opposes a ('on-.
stitutional Convention.
NO. II.
N. O. Delta.
In a recent article in this paper, we
ventured to say that if one were to
scratch the skin of an anti-constitu
tional convention tman, undhrneatht
would be found a holder of lecal or
illegal State or city bonds, or a f'riend
of such bond-holdets. It was showi
in that article that Senator l"ralnk i'.
Stubb, of Oaclhita 1'arish, ninder
whose manipulation that parish has
voted against holding a Convention.
was one of the beneliciaries of the
loan or subsidy of State iimds, (af'
terwards by another act of fraud con
vetted into a stock subscriptin,.)
amounting to one million one hun
dred and twenty-two thousand dol
lars, ($1,122,000) issued, to 'he coIm
hination known as that of ludeling,
Ray, Stubbs, Waddell and others, un
der authority of Acts of the Le.gisla
ture 108 of 1868, and !7 ,of ;;7"',
which were passed upon false and
therefore fraudulent statements as to
theowership of the Vickshurg., Shrteve
port and Texas Railroad made to the
Legislature by the parties interested
in obtaining the subsidy. .\s there
were eight persons named in the .Act
108 of 1868 as the pretended and al
leged owners of the railroads, it ne ould
seem to follow that if they w.tre all
aqually interested in the schemue of
plunder, the share of these hIonds
eoming to Frank P. Stulhhs would
amount to the sum of 81,l10,250, but
as they were not al equally interested,
we have had recourse to the irectldls
of the United States Circuit Court, to
ascertain just what proportion of theso
State bonds this model State Sen;ator
pocketed as his share of the "swag."
The paper, filed in the suit of Jack
sion et al. vs. Lndeling et al., and at
tached to Ludeling's answers to in
terrogatories, and. known as ":las
covenant or agreement to January 10,
1866," between the members of the
Ludeling Combination, shows that
Stubbs was interested in S23 out of
135 shares-that is to say, to the
amount of $25,000, or tive and 10- 100l
parts of the $135,000 which was suh
scribed to the combination for the
purchase of the road, although it was:
never really paid out, they having
throng a successful trick, bid in the
property for $50,000, which sunt is
yet in the possession of the purchas
ers, the majority of the mortgagees
having refused to rqcognize the law
fulnoes of the sale. The share there
fore, coming to Mr. Stubbs from the
State subsidy, according to this meth
od of calculation, would be five and
forty hundreth parts of $1,lPuJ,)O, or
about $207,777. Add to this, forty
years interest at eight per cent, which
the bonds were to .carry, t664,86;,
and we, have the nice little plum of
$872,763 which Mr. Stubbs would
realize-at the end of forty years if he
were to keep for that length of time
his share of the subsidy. We ate
aware that these bonds have fandc'
at 60'ceots on the dollar under the,.
Funding Act .of 1874, but this fact.
does not at all weaken or atfect the
reasoning of this and ourt' preceeding
article in which we showed the inter
eat of Fr. Stubbs in the bonded ditet
of Louisiana, and therefore his oppo"
sition to a Constitutional Convention
which might possibly, and we hope
would certainly, strike, his and all
similar fraqduleot bonds sucla death
blow that they would have as little'
value as the French Assignats of the
last century, or the Confederate Treas
ury note$, with a barrel full of which
in Aprlj 1865, you could hot'u i at,
day's inatketiug for a small famiUly.
