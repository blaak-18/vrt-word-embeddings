I have awful spells of neuralgia
and have doctored a great deal with
out getting much benefit. For the
y ears I have been taking
Dr. Miles Anti-Pain Pills and they

TOUCH OF A WOMAN’S HAND
AS REVEALED IN COUNTRY
HOMES.
Last week I took a trip over the
state and it was entirely new to me.
We sped along country roads, down
through quiet valleys and out again
upon the narrow country lanes, pass
ing a little town here, one there, and
country houses at every turn of the
road. What impressed me most was
this: Everywhere was seen the touch
of woman’s hand. The yards so
nicely kept are now abloom with the
majestic flowers known as golden
glow, geraniums are at their loveliest
stage and the vines that have been
climbing for weeks to cover large
porches are in all their glory. Then,
again, were seen so many well kept
farms with grassy lawns and huge
flower beds scattered about. How
pretty those big flower beds were
with their variety of old-fashioned
flowers nodding to passersby. Plainly
was it evidenced by these well kept
homes that therein were women in
mates. It was seen at a glance where
big, comfortable cushions were thrown
about, and the easy chairs and news
papers were so convenient that even
man could rest there.
Then once in a while a house would
come into view, where not even a de
cent pathway led up to the house, and
tall weeds and grasses almost hid the
little home that looked like it wanted
to hide its weather-beaten face from
observers. One might imagine that
back of the walls were tired faces,
tired hearts and tired bodies, people
tired of life. But the next instant
brought one to a well kept farm
home, showing acre after acre of farm
land where home and farm were both
well cared for. So much for the
wave of civic improvement that has
swept over this country from center
to circumference. To behold the
beauty of nature, further enhanced
by the toil of man, is interesting to
all, but who does not have a feeling
of comradeship toward the woman
who beautifies her home, let it be ever
so humble, or ever so far from oth
ers? To bring the flowers, the birds
and sunshine to one’s own home does
not always call for a mansion on a
fine hillside, there is too much evi
dence to the contrary on the pretty
farms dotted over the verdant I d's
of Missouri as well as other states. —
Woman’s National Daily.
Good vinegar can be made from
apple parings in the following way:
Take the parings and put them in a
six-gallon stone jar and tamp them
with a potato masher till they are
pretty well bruised, then pour water
over them till covered. We continue
to put parings in till they leave
been in a week or more, then we
strain out the parings and pour the
•cider into a keg and repeat the op
eration till one keg is full. We then
lay an old piece of cotton cloth over
the bung and let nature do the rest.
In two months we have a keg of the
finest kind of vinegar.—Oklahoma
