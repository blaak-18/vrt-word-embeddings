THE SUBRSTANCE OF A SERI(OII N DEI.VEIR
ED BY REV. T. J. Il(U)GI, OF TIlE
METHIODIST CIIL'IRCH IN THIS CITY,
LAST WEEK.
"Lord, what wilt thou have lme to do f":
Acts chap 9, v. 6.
Our text contains the anxious in
quiry of Saul of Tarsus ilmmnediately
after his wonderful conversion to God,
"Lord, wlhtt wilt thou have mle to
do t" And the Lord answered and
said, "Arise, and go into the city, and
It shall b,e told thee what thano shalt
do.' 01 eying the voice l)ivine, lie
proceeded at once to the city of Da
mascus, where lie was visited by An
taiamas, one of the Disciples of our
Lord, who took (lie blinded sch,lar of
Ganialiel by tho hand, and said,
"Blrother Saul, the Lord even Jesus
that appeared unto thee by the way
as thou eaii est, hat Ii sellt ime, that
thou Inighitest receive thy sight and
be filled with the Holy Ghost." And
God said lie "was a chosen vessel to
bear His name before the Gentiles."
As soon as Saul was convinced of
the Iftwer of God, as displayed in his
son Jeans, and convinced too of his
own duty, lie moved forward to its
lperforinance at once with great zeal
and energy, and became the mighty
Pauln the Apostle.
Nor was he to be discouraged with
difficulties. lie bore with Christian
patience and fortitude, hardships,
perils, stripes, imprisonnments and
finally death in the service of his
Divine Master, and is to-day weal ing
the crown of eternal life.
I have selected this text with the
view, mainly, of addressing the mem
bers of my church, and I hope also to
derive some benefits from the same as
your pastor and spiritual advisor.
Let each one of us at this, the first
service of the year, make this text
our earnest, anxious inquiry, "Lord,
what wilt thou have me to do ?"
What humble part can I bear in the
church ? What work, what mission
is there for me t and let us also say
with Isaiah, "Here I am Lord, send
ate," for I cannot afford to be idle
while there is so much to be done.
Brethren, we have a great work be.
fore us. "The harvest truly is plen
teous, but the laborers are few; pray
ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
that He will send forth laborers into
his harvest." Our responsibility to
ourselves, to our neighbors, and to
qur God, is great, indleed, and we need
the exercise of much faith, and close
and sweet communion with our be
loved Saviour, to enable us to perform
our work.
Saint l'aul says to the church at
Rome, be "not slothful in business;
bla fervent in spirit; serving the
Lord," and thus are we required to
serve God diligently and fervently,
ever remembering that "the King's
business requires haste."
Patrick 'Hedr.V lMid in ihe balls of
Congress, "Eternal, vigilance is the
., ce df liMerty," abd this motto is as
applicable to religion as to politics, a
never ceasing,.vigilance; an unyield
ing perseverance is the drop tha
wears away the stone, is the road to
success in either secular or Divine
matters.
Travelers to the East tell us of a
motto carved on the walls of the
Delphian Temple,which has ihpressed
historians with the industry of the
ancient Greeks. "Nothing is impossi- j
ble to industry." Indeed, industry is
the key that unlocks tihe goldcaverns; a
that drives the steam ear through the
lountalhs; that keeps alive the busi
bess of tie world; commerce, agricul- I
ture, amdreligion would aInogour and
die in the absence of industry.
Every man and every woman has a ]
mission, a work to perform, and God g
enables them to perform that mission, a
that work; we only need the will to
inquire, and a determination to perse
vere.o "There are diversities of gits, I
but of the sanme spirit." All cannot J
be preachers. All cannot be Sabbath ir
chool superintendents. All cannot I
be stewards. We must first have
mIembers, then teachers and officers, in
aand not only have rank and file, but p
all mast iealise that they are individ
nally respousible to perform some n
share of work in tie body of,the tI
church. If you cannot briug aso large

unless you are familiar with revealed
truth.
Paul taught that faith was neces
sary to Salvation, that by the exer
ER- cise of this grace they might obtain
riE promises and enter into rest-James
T i\, followed hiMi and found the clhurch
inactive and resting on faith alone,
"- and while he would hold the banner
of faith as high as Paul, yet lie says,
in.- "Faith wfitiout works is dead,"--and
tely John says "We shall be judged, every
od, man according to his works" and this
to theme of wotKu has h een preached to
nd us firom the gates of the forfeited
nd Edlen to the present hour.
salt What would we think of a man who
he avered his faith in a certain Railroad
)a- enterprise, or any other business, and
An- who had time, capital and opportunity
onr for engaging in the same and never
r of put his shoulder to the wheel what
iil, estimate would we place on his vera
sus city f very little I should say, for we
ayv judge a man's faith by his works
hat And certain it is that in the warts of
Il trade, in the multitudinous pursuits
(nd and compititions going vigorously on,
to as well as in the church of our Lord
n Jesus Christ, there is work enough
I of for the sincere and honest heart as
Ilis the beautiful acanthls vine by steady
his growth twines around the true firm
its enrinthean pillar ; so let the heauti
real ful church of our ascended Lord, en
hty twine around the true steady prom
ises of Him who said "So I am with
ith you always even to the end of the
ian world."
How remarkably true is the old
ind adage "There is no excellence with
his out great!labor"--fronlthe dust at our
iuig feet, to man the last stroke of God's
handiwork, the earth is one vast la
tlhe horatory where decomposition and
in- re fornmation are constantly going on;
to the blast of nature's filrnace never
es ceases, and its fires never burn low ;
or. the earth, the air, the water teem
irt with busy life, the whole world is an
ext imnated with the same spirit, onward,
rd, unceasingly, age after age, it pursues
", its course teaching us a perpetual
the lesson of industry.. The joyous song
ion of labor sings out from the million
a}y tongued and voice of earth , and is
end caught up by the rolling spheres who
die join in the universal chores, activity
activity-activity.
be- And not only is industry, work, nc
.n. tivity, a law of our being; but in
'ay Heaven "they cease not day nor
st, night" to praise, adore and worship
Ito him who offered himself as a willing
to sacrifice for the sins of the world.
to In view of all this let us say Lord
ed I cannot afford to he idle, I wait now
