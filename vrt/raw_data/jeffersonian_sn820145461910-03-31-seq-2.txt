A Department of Interest to Populists
TEXAS HAS MANY OLD POPS YET
Dear Mr. Watson: —I have been
thinking of writing to you for some
time. I read both of the Jeffs, and
am greatly interested in your writ
ings. You are no straddler. You
are just the kind of a man I admire.
I have voted for you every time you
were on our National ticket and I
am not ashamed of it, but am proud
to know I voted for a man who has
stood by the common people and is
fighting for the poor down-trodden,
burden-bearing farmers. I will vote
for you again if I get the chance. I
would make you President if I had it
in my power. Your writings are
having effect already. I was out in
Texas the first of the year, and every
place I found your paper and Maga
zine I found strong Watson men. I
believe if we could get the people to
read your Jeffs we would have a
great revival of the Populist party.
I am your friend,
J. P. OTWELL.

A MISSIONARY FOR THE JEFFS.
Dear Sir:—l want to say to Mr.
B. F. Arnold, of Nashville, Ark., that
I have kept the faith. I tenaciously
cling to the tenets of Populism. If
I have reliquished the one-thou
sandth part, the thickness of a hair,
I don’t know it. lam there to stay,
and I am with Mr. Watson to a fin
ish. I have given my last penny to
Foreign Missions. When 1 have
money to spare, I will use it in the
distribution of Jeff literature.

TWO MORE TEXAS POPS.
Dear Sir: —I want to answer Mr.
Arnold. “Yes,” I am still in the
faith, and will be to the end of life.
Wish we all could get together and
go to work for it, seems to me that
the time is ripe. Well, Mr. J. R.
McKnight is still in the faith; from
New Salem, Texas.
Yours for the right,

THE RIGHT SORT OF DEMOCRAT.
I am now seventy-seven and a
half years old; am writing this with
out glasses. I am a Democrat, and,
like one of your correspondents, I
had to leave the old party in order
to retain my Democracy. It is a
part, and a big part, of my religion.
I, of course, can’t expect to live long
enough to see our country governed
by honest men, neither do I think it
will ever be, again. All I want now
is the Bible and Tom Watson’s writ
ings. The Bible tells us what is
right, and you tell us how to do it.
So the two are about all the litera
ture I want. I am going to stir up
the boys here, and see if we can’t
get them organized and go to work,
and try once more to teach the peo
ple a little sense.
Yours trulv,
OLD POPULIST.
Granger, Texas.
THIS POP WANTS TO GET BUSY.
Dear Sir:—By the request of Mr.
B. F. Arnold, of Nashville, Ark., I
will say the Democratic party left
me when it nominated Horace Gree
ly for President.
I worked with the Knights of La
bor until the People’s Party was
born in Texas. -1 was with Neugent
and Kirby and Gibbs, and if we
could call all of them in, and those he
mentioned, we could do something.
Now I make a motion to organize
the State and go to work and try
to do something, and these scatter
ing sheep will come home when we
get organized on the Omaha plat
form. We need a State president
and secretary and committee. With
out this we can not do anything,
for we must have a head.
I expect to live and die a Popu-
list, for I know it is right. I am no
Socialist, and the Democrat and Re
publican parties have married a
long time ago, and I think John
Sherman must have performed the
ceremony.
Yours truly,
G. W. NEVINS.
Lonoke, Ark.
ONE OF THE ORIGINAL OF THE
TEXAS POPS.
Dear Sir: —I saw a letter from
Bro. B. F. Arnold, of Nashville, Ark.,
wanting to know who still stands
on the Omaha platform. I am one
that never has voted anthing but a
Pop ticket since its organization,
and never will as long as we have a
ticket in the field. Things are
changing.
With much hope for reform move
ment, as ever,
Yours,
J. P. MAJOR.

FROM A YANKEE POPULIST.
Dear Sir:—ln regard to Brother
Arnold’s request, I will say that I
am ONE of the Old Guard from
away back in Peter Cooper and
“Brick” Pomeroy times, and have
never “wobbled” on the spindle from
the demand made at that time by
the Greenback clubs, which could be
found in nearly every State in the
Union, viz.: “Immediate calling in
and payment of every United States
bond with full legal tender green
backs.” There is no mark of fusion
on me, and have never voted a
Democrat ticket since 1864, and a
Republican ticket, NEVER. There
is “where I am at.” Am trying my
best to get some Old Guard assist
ance to put the old demand back to
where it was when the Toledo con
vention knocked it out through the
tools of the money power. lam try
ing to find one hundred of the Old
Guard that will unite to form an or
ganization, as a preliminary organi
zation in every State in the Union.
When the Old Guard, away back in
the ’7o’s, had the ONE main issue,
the payment of Government bonds
with greenbacks, the people were
flocking to that platform in great
numbers. Are there not one hun
dred of that Old Guard, who read
this, that will once more enlist and
raise the cry once more that “Con
gress shall create and issue all the
money to the people without the aid
of banks.” UNITE on this ONE
point, and show the people WHY
Congress should furnish the money
instead of the banks. Do this, and
guard against pretenders, and we
will soon have a following that will
put the money power on the defen
sive. The system has many defend
ers, but no defense..
Now I would like to know, not so
much what you ARE doing, as what
you are willing to do. It seems to
me that it is time something was
done. Some time it may be TOO
LATE.

WANTS STANDARD OF REPRE
SENTATIVES RAISED.
Dear Sir:—l am unable to see why
the grand old State of Georgia has
no place in her political arena for
you. Her Senators are mummies in
our National halls of Congress, and
as for the Representatives I think
she is lower down in mental repre
sentation than she has ever been in
her history, and does not excell any
State in any respect whatever.
Shades of Stephens, Toombs, Hill and
Felton, never did you gentlemen of
the old regime think that your dis
tricts would be so poorly represent
ed. Why can we not have the stan
dard set by these old giants upheld
by men who would approach them,
or equal them, in such men as Tom
Watson and Seaborn Wright? This
ISba 'Seffer-sonlan
is the day of short weights and short
measures, and I will say short men;
it is the day of the politician and
demagogue. What will be the out
come of the fight now on between
Pinchot-Glavis on the side of the
people and Ballinger-monkeyings,
thieves and the Taft gang in general
against the people? Os course, the
money kings will win. Will the Su
gar Trust coat over their theft, and
Uncle Sam swallow it and let them
go free? I believe such will be the
finis. If it were a boy in his tender
years, say thirteen, caught stealing a
bicycle frame, and a judge like one
in Atlanta, the kid would go up for
eight years and come out a confirmed
criminal. The Georgia reform school
is about as fit for a child as hell is
for a saint. There are some asses
who would like to out-do Ben Lind
sey. Shame we have no Lindseys in
Georgia. There is an opportunity
for a man of brains to immortalize
himself by changing the method of
the old gang and save the youths,
making respectable citizens instead
of criminals of them. The people are
coming to their senses and you will
be recognized and in the lead in less
than five years, though the prejudic
ed and ignorant and the old pap
suckers will fight mightily to hold
you down. “Truth crushed to earth
will rise again, the eternal years of
God are hers, but error wounded
writhes in pain and dies among her
worshippers.” A. H. S.

WANTED: A POPULIST TICKET.
Dear Tom:—lt seems I ought to
know you, I have had the honor of
shaking your hand twice in my life,
once in Albany, during your cam
paign for President, and once at
Meigs, when Pops were first in evi
dence. I have always been an ad
mirer of you and your principles, and
have been a reader of your literature
ever since, and expect to continue as
long as I can get a dollar.
I am an old Confederate soldier,
bore the hardships of the Western
army from March, 1862, up until the
close. We want you to pick us out a
candidate, for the Pops down in
Mitchell have got a lot of confidence
in your judgment. Let us know
through your paper or by private
letter.
I remain as ever,
G. A. McELVEY..

OLD POPULIST PRINCIPLES NOW
WORKING OUT IN LOS
ANGELES.
Dear Sir: —We have recently had
two city elections in Los Angeles,—
the hottest and most important of
any ever held in this city. First we
had the direct primaries, direct
nominations by the people, which
gave any candidate the right to have
his name placed on the ballot; pro
vided he obtained a hundred or more
names on a petition for nomination.
Candidates’ names were printed on
the ballot alphabetically, without any
party name. After the primaries, all
candidates were dropped except the
two highest for each office. For the
regular election, names were printed
on ballots in same manner as the
primaries. The people won by a
large majority,—electing the mayor,
councilmen, and other officials, who
were in favor of direct primaries, the
initiative and referendum and the re
call. It was a fight between the peo
ple and the corrupt politicians and
corporations. After the election, I
attended a banquet of the victorious.
About 560 people were present, and
speeches were made by Francis J.
Heney, of San Francisco, our mayor,
new councilmen and others, —all lay
ing great stress on the primary law
and the initiative and referendum
and the recall.
As I sat there and listened to
those big fellows talk, I thought to
myself, “Do you know where the di
rect nomination, the initiative and
referendum and recall came from?
Where did you find it?” And the
answer is, “Through the old Popu
list Party.”
The people are marching on to vic
tory: these principles are spreading,
and must and will be adopted and
enacted into law to redeem this coun
try. The thousands who are leaving
the old parties, and becoming inde
pendent, are the only hope we have
to save this nation from going into
“the grave of all the great nations of
the past.”
But we should never forget that
the money power is the biggest and
worst monopoly in this country,—
the worst that the world has ever
seen. It is sapping the life-blood out
of this republic. The. Government
should issue all money, gold, silver
and greenbacks, all to be full legal
tender, and enough of it to do and
carry on the business of all the peo
ple.
Very truly yours,
J. D. BAILEY.

A GREAT LABOR-SAVER.
If you are planting tomatoes, cab
bages, tobacco or sweet potatoes this
year, you should write to the Masters
Planter Co., 166 South Water St.,
Chicago, 111., for particulars of their
plant-setter, which does away with
all the tedious work of setting out a
field of plants. It is inxepensive, and
is worth far more than its cost to
any grower of plants.
Be a gentleman and
chew good tobacco.

PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
Martin, Tenn.
“I had a curiosity to see
whether the Primitive Baptist
was as unfair, hide-bound, ar
rogant and abusive as the pa
pers run by missionary fa
natics. ... To my agreeable
surprise I found that the
whole build and spirit of the
paper was up to my ideal of a
Christian paper. ... In choos
ing your religious reading,
you might give the Primitive
Baptist a trial, even though
you are not of that faith and
order. You’ll get some really
religious literature, if you
do.”—Thos. E. Watson in The
