Discontented Wife.
"Dl)ear, me," said Letty Wyngard,
,'' shall go crazy ! Five children all
clamioring at once, thle preserve ket
1th l oili.ng over, the pickles ferment
in,, imoths in mly Sunday shlawl, and
the dog running away with the soup
bone for inler."
And Letty stood in the nlidhle of
the Irooan, liolding her lihead with botll
lihands, as if she niomnentarily expected
it to sail up into the air like a bhal
loon !
Letty was very pretty, after an add
.,ypsy type,.withi great dark eyes, a
Ibrow and healthy skin, and hair asi
black as a crow's wing ; and this,
roulnd of daily carces and dlluties to
which, as the wife of a younig ca:rpen
ter, she was condemned, had planted
i wrinkle on her velvet-smaootl fore
head.
John Wyngaylrd burst out laughing,
and that in Mrs. Letty's case, piroPtelii
the one hair that biroke the camel's
back. She began to cry.
"Now, Letty, don't be a goose," t
said he, soothingly. "Why, what
do you know about real troubhle "
"I don't care," sobbed Letty. "I
am sick of it all. I'ml tired of patch
ing old clothes and haishhing old ineats
aid hoarding pennies. I'mi tired of-"
"Your hiusband and your children,"
gravely interrupted Mr. Wyngartd.
"Is that it, Letty ?
Mrs. Wyingard pouted, and was
silent. She didn't like to own it, but
tfor the nomeLut she alnost felt tired ,
of theim.
"I might have married rich," she ,
said, slowly twisting the baby's bib
strings around and around her finger.
"I mlight have been Howard Lindt
sley's wife, and he is a very wealthy
manin, they tell iie."
"It's a ipity you didn'tt," Said John,
provokingly.
"Yes, it is a pity," said Lefty stung
beyond endutianee, as she flouInced
out of the room.
And then, as she sat down to sew a[
button on Johnny's jacket., and braid
little Helen's hair, and show Iosie
about the arithmetic sums, and final
ly, when the four eldest ones were
packed off to school, to bathe the
baby and rock it to sleep. Letty Wyll
gird coild not help thinking how º
muech brighter her pathway would be,
if, instead of saying "no" to hand
some Harry Lindsley, she had utter
ed the other monosyllable. Not but i
what she loved John better, by far;
than Iloward-but this wearing I,
grinding succession of petty cares and
detail ewas snapping all the life and
elasticity out of her.
She looked disdainfuilly down at
the falded colico) dress she wore ipatch
ed and darned in nmor'e than one plhice.
"If I had marrliied IHIowalEi Lind- I
sley," she said to herself, "1 eould I
have wolrn silks and jewels everyl' day,
with hired servants to wait on mIle,
and an elegant carriage to drive oult
in whenever I pleased. Oh, dear,
what at world of trouble this is."
And as Mhs. Wyngard laid her lit
tie rosy cheeked infilnt down to sleep,
she felt as if her lot had fallen inll
thorny places.
Just as she had taken her place I
once again over the brass kettle in l
which she was trying to do ull sonie
rocky pounlld pears, which a neighbor [
had given her, there camle a loud I
knocking at the door.
"Come in," said Letty, and the
housekeeper from Hadfield Ihalil, the I
big miansihn on thI hill, catmie nin
cing across the threshold.
Letty diusted offia clhair, in consider
able of a flllrry, for Mrs. Ellison was
a grand lady ill her way, who wore I
black silk and laces, and her bonnets
directly from a New York milliner, I
every spring and fall.
"WVont you sit down, Mrs. E-l
isom, 9" said she colorlng to the roots I
of her pretty hair, and secretly hoping
that Mrs. Ellison did not obcrve the
patchl on lher calico diess.
"Thank you, miy dear-I am in a
greiat hurty," said Mrs. Ellison. "I
have some fine laCies, and mlusins,
and Valenciennes handkerchiefs heire
froim my lady at the HaIll. The latn- 1
dress hasn't come down yet and she
ain't willing to trust the lady's maid
with 'em, and they mitst be ready by
dark-and so I told her I knew a personm
in the village that was a master hand
at laces and fluting, and such likle,
and I depend on you, my dear, to do
'eti uip for ile."
"She'll pay you a dollar, at least,"
said M1rs. Ellison. "She ain't none of
the stingy sort, my lady ain't."
A dollar in Letty WVyngard's byes
was no inconsidlerable sum. A dollar
wonld buy tile new shoes that Rosie
needed so saidly-or flannel for the
baby's winter sacks-or half a hun
dred other necessaries which Letty
could think of.
"Yes," said she, "I'll do it.
My preserves will soon be finished.
Lay the bundle on the table, please.
So the new family have arrived at
thie Hall at last '"
Mrs. Ellison nodded assent. Sthe
had lived housekeeper witl the Had
tields, of Hadfield Hall, for twenty
years, and was sorry enonugh when
the old lhace went into new Ilhands.
But a situation was a situation, so
she had stayed otn.
"Yes," said shIe, "Mr. and Mrs.
Howand Lindsley."
Letty gave such a start that the
preserve kettle had ncearly tipped
over into tile firt.
Lindsley 1" cried she, with a little
hysterical labgh. "What a fUUny
name!"
"Handsome, stylish people, witlh
more uioney, to all appearances, than
they know what to do with," went on
Mrs. Ellison. "I just wish you could
see her dresses and jewels ! Stepha
nie, the Frenclh maid, showed me
when she was unpacking 'cm, and it's
as good as a play !"
Letty said nothing, but stirred
busily away at her preserves, while
the old housekeeper maundered on
about the wealth and grandeur of the
new possessors of Haddeld Hall. And
all this might harve been hers.
"When shall I send for the laces ?"
Mrs. Ellison finally asked, when sihe
rose to depart.
"I'II take them home myself about
dusk," said Lotty, inwardly resolving
to get herselt a glimpse into this par
adise which had so nearly been her
ownl.
And so, at twilight, with the dain
tily ironed and flited lacws in her
basket; she walked to Iladleld Iall.
How stately it looked with ist broad
colonaded facade, all glittering with
lights ; its grand conservatory at the
Lack, where lpal leaves and lianners
brushed the grass top, and the ter
raced grounds! Oh, if she had only
said "yes" to H Ioward Lindsley eleven
years ago ?
Within, everything was in keeping.
Axrninister carpets, like ba nks of
moss, covered the floor-marble sta
tnies stood in velvet lined niches-
lights glowed softly, and tables, load
edl with ornaments, stood around.
"Hlush ! said Letty, as Mrs. Ellison,
with some pride, pointed out the va
rious beauties of the place. "What
is that noise like a woman crying
In the next roomn, I think."
Mrs. Ellison's face clouded over.
"It's Mrs. Liundsley, poor dear," said
she. "The master's a brute. lie's
been drinking too much-Malahemoi- I
selle Stephanie says he always drinks t
too much-and lie struck her ! Struck I
her, and called her a.whimpcring fool,
before all of us servants. I never saw
a man strike ni woman before, and I
declare it made me sick all over. But
Stephanie says it's at commeon thing I
enough. Oh, my dear, sihe's wretcheu
in spite of all her money."
"Has she no children I Letty softly
asked.
"She had two, but she lost 'em both.
Mademoiselle Stephanie says she of
tean cries and wishes she was dead,
too. And I don't wonder much, with
such a husband as she's got. IIHush !
there he comes now."
And shrinking behind a carved
group of Italian marble statuary, the
two women watched Howard Linds
ley stalk gloomily by, with red, in
flamed eyes, sullen, down looking face
and shiufHling, unsteady footstep.
Silently Letty Wyngard went home, I
thanking God in her heart that she
was a poor man's wife.
"Have you heard of the accident !" I
asked old Peter Styles, who was
standing out at the gate, as she hur
ried by, in the deepening dusk.
"No, what accident I What has I
happened."
"That there house as your husband
was workin' in has all tumbled in ! I
All a heap of ruins! Something
wrong about the foundation, they say,
andl-"
"Oh, my God! wildly interrupted
Ietty, elaping her hands. "Was he
hurt? M311 husband I"
"Well," hesitated old Styles, "there
was two men killed, and one had his I
arm broke. But-" a
Letty waited to hear no more.
Swift as an arrow out of a bow she
sped homeward, a horrible dread
winging her footsteps with almost I
incredible speed. Oh ! if John should (
be killed-John, her faithful loyal I
husband whom she had reeked so
lightly of-whom that very day she
had allowed to leave her without the
good-bye kiss. If her children should I
be fatherless-if
"John ! John !" she wailed is sihe a
pushed open the door, and went, i
breathlessly into thie kitchlen.
"WVell, little woman, nwhat is it " a
And--oh! thanks to an All Merci
ful Heaven-John Wyngard hinsei4 I
turned his bright, loving face towards I
her from thie heartheide, where he
was sitting, with a child on either
knee. "I know what is in your dumb,
questioning eyes, Letty. I an not
hurt, thank God. I had gone to thie I
hiad ware store for another barrel of I
nails, when thie building fell. No, no, 1
Letty, you'll not get rid of me lquite
so easy."
Letty threw herself sobbing into
his arms.
"Ahb! John, John, love me. Hold
me close to your heart, John. I've
been repining and selfish. I've never
been half good enough to you; bint,
please God, I'll be a better woman 1
and a more faithful wife from this
night hencefoi'ward."
And then sire told him thie history
of her day's adventures.
"It's natural enouglh, little wife,"
said John, kindly stroking hier hair.
"But for all that, Pm glad you've
realized that money isn't always hap
piness."
And a more contented couple than
Johln Wyngard and his wifei Letty
never sat by a cheery fireside. Letty
had profitedl by her lesson.
PRIVILEGES OF LEAP YEAR.
"Young ladies have thie privilege of
saying anything during leap year,"
she said, eyeinng him out of thle cornets
of her eyes with a sweet look.
His hieart gave a great bounda, and
while ire wondered if shie was going
to ask the question which he haud so
long desired and feared to do, he an
swvered "Yes."
"And thie young men must not re
fuse," said sihes
"No, no! How could they 7" sighed
lie.
"Well then," said she, will you--
He fell on his knees and saida: Any
thing, anything you ask, darling."
"Wait tillIget through. Vill you
take a walk, and not hang around our
Shouse so much 1"
And he walked.
Gen. Schenck got to Washington
I Monday night and Fernanudo Wood
Ihad a party of five made up to meet
hIim. "My old friend," saidl thie ex
emubassador, "I really can not play."
"Oh, nonsense," says Fernando, "that
little investigation needn't trouble
you. Bygone assoeiations will revive
I you." "But," says Robert, "there's
another reason why I shouldn't play."
"WlIt is that l " says Fernando. "I
haven't got any money," says Schenck.
S"Ah !" says Fernando, moving mourn
tully away.--Courier-Jourual.
The Office Seeker.
The following is from an old story,
by J. K. Paulding,-the novelist, and
lhrst went the roindis of the press
thlity years algo. It represents a con
vers:ation between a membier of the
Cabinet and a hanger-onl for oflice, f
and is suitable for the present tie :
The. Secretary was called from his
Ihed one cold winter m11ining, to at
tend to business of the "utiiost coti
sequence." Ile ftund Ia queer, long
sided 1man, at least six feet high with a
a littlie a;lqIle hlead, a long queue. and
a face critically round, as rosy as a
rip.' chicr iy anl1 the following coni
_velratio n llll l :-
"Well, my firiend, what situation

but sii'Iio ehow or other, I thiink I
should like to be a minister, I doni't

headed iman, "I wouldn't ilmuch care Iu
if I took a situation in one of the de- -
patNlliilt1s. I woildn't mioch um I fild

thing." Ii
"ly dear sir, ni sorrty, very sorry s

ily frielnd stroke his chin and Seeml- i
ed struggling to bring down the soar
ings of his high ambiition to the lri'e- t;
cut crisis. At length he answer'ed
"Why-y-y, yes ; donI't care if I get I
a good Collectorship, or Inspeeto.r-oi
ship, or SiIur'veyoirship, or Navy Agen
Cy, Ior aniytIhi of that sort,"
"Ueally, imy good sir," said the
Secri'etary, I regret exceedligly that i
not only all these places, but every n
other place ofi cousequeicen in the H
Goveriiinment, is at present occupied. tl
Pr'ay, sir, think of something else."
lie then, after some hesitation, ti
asked for a clerkship, and finally the 1
place of messenger to one of the pub- o
lic otlices. Finding no vacancy here,
lie seemed in vast lroplexity, and
looked all around the room, fixing
his eyes at length on me and measur
oug my height from head to foot. At
last putting on one of the drollest
looks that ever adorned the faice of 8
man, lie said : i
"Maister, you and I steen to be built
pretty much alike ; haven't you some a.
old clothes you can spare I" 8
Take the Paper. I
We find the following going the a
ronids of the ipress. Rlead, lponder f
andil--pay up! Why don't you take s
the pape.r, I they're the life of my e
delight, except about election time, "
andl then I read for spite. Subscribe, i
you cannot loose a cent; why should I
you be afraid 7 for cash thus spent is g
money lent at interest, fouar-fold paid.
Go, then, and take the papers, and 11
pay to-daly, nor pay delay, and niy t
word it is inferred, you'll live until
you're gray. An old neighbor of mine,
while dying of a cough, desired to
hear the latest news while lie was go- t
ing off. I took took the paper and I read c
of some new pills in f'orce ; lie bought
a box-and he is dead t no-hearty
_as a hiorse. I knew two men as much I
alike as e'er you saw two stumps; i
and no phrenologist coiuld flind a dif
feremzco in their bumps. One takes hi
the paper and his life is happier thianl
a king's, his children can all read and I
write, and talk of miien and things.
The other took no paler, and, while
strolling through the wood, a tree
fell dowi nnd broke his crIown, and t
killed hnim-"very goods" Had he ,
been reading all the news, at homoe
like his neighbor Jim, Pil bet a centlli

French Rolls.--ý quarts of sifted
flour, a lIuiil, of lard alout the size of
an eg-oDie a little larger of butter;
stir inhto t le flour tie satme as in llia

milk and wa;ter, to mix ; add a little
salt, j teateupful of home-made yeass
or tlhree tablespoonful's of baker's
yeast. .Mix in the evening as for
bread, and let rise. In the morning

Rich Brown Gravy.-Brown light
ly and carefully, fronm fiour to six
ounccs of lean hanm, thickly sliced
and cut into large dice ; lift these out
and put theml into the pan in which
the gravy is to be mlade ; next, fry
lightly, also, a couple of pounds of
neck of beef, dredged mloderately with
lour, and slightly with iepler; put
this when it is done over the ham,
;alld then brown gently, and add to
them onl e not large colmmon onion.
I'o:lr over these ingredients a quart
of boiling water, or of weak but well
flavored broth, bring the whole slow
ly to a boil, clear off tile scum with
great care, throw in a saltspoonful of
salt, four cloves, a blade of mace,
twenty corns of pepper, a bunch of
'savory herbs, a carrot, and a few
slices of celery ; these last twto mtay
he fried or not, as is most convenient.
Ioil the gravy very softly until it is
reduced to little more than a pint;
strain, and set by until the fat can be
taken fromt it. Heat it anew, add
more salt, if needed, and a little
mushroon catsup, cayenne vinegar,
or whatever flavorlng it may require
fotr the dish with which it is to be
served; it will seldom need thick
ening. A dozen small smushroons,
prepared as for pickling, mnay be ad
ded to it at first with advanltage.
Half this quantity of gravy will be
sulfficient for a single tureen, and the
econom.ist can diminish a little the
proportion of meat when it is thought
too imuch.
Balky IIorses,-The brain of a
horse seems to entertain but one
thought at a tilme; for this reason
continued whipping is out of the
question, and only confiemis his stub
born resolve. liut if you can by any
.means c .han.ge the direction of his
mind, give him a new subject to think
of, nine times out of teni you will
ihav:e no furlher trouble inl starting
him. As silllnle a trick as a little
pepper', aloes, or the like, thrown
back otl his louge, will oftel succeed
by turning his attention to the taste
in his mouth. A siliple remedy is to
take a couple of turnsill of commloln
wrapping-twine, such als gl'octrs use,
around the f're leg h jtst below the
klece, thight enouight fr the horse to
feel, and tie in a bow-klnot. At tile
first cluck hIe will generally go dalc
ilg off, anld after going a short dis
tance, yeou can get out, remove the
string to prevent i.njury to the ten
don illn your flutlher drive. Or tie a
string tightly aroulnd the ear, which
will serve to divett his mind to for
get his stubborncss.-London Gar
