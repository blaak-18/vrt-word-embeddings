do for presidential possibility!
His Examiner here in San Francis
co has severely tried the people’s
patience! No one more than the
writer prizes Hearst’s great educa
tional works for humanity—GßEAT
—next to the Jeffersonian and Wat
son’s Jeffersonian Magazine, in the
whole world, but trading with “ ti
gers,” bargaining with boodlers is
too much to condone, and then as in
stanced, his Examiner in San Fran
cisco is in the hands of a Junta,
while printing Hearst’s Humanity,
run the paper on pirate lines. At
tacking this and that great end only
to suddenly stop—a dull metallic
‘ ‘ thud, ’ ’ and people with foiled
hopes perish while the evils again
arise! Alas! “Tom” Watson, you
are the last hope! If the people will
not rally around your banner and
vote this money power down in 1908,
then if" I should live, count me a so
cialist—even an anarchist—ever aft
er, for they cannot be worse.

AGREES WITH MR. WATSON.
Mr. Watson:
Your sample copy of Jeffersonian
Weekly came. The Jeffersonian Mag
azine, for which I sent 14 cents, is
here. This January number is very
excellent, I think. You say you’ve
put me down for a year on your sub
scription list.
It would be necessary to change my
postoffice address at least twice a
year, probably thrice. This is why
I do not subscribe. I prefer to buy
single copies rather than trouble you
in this way. So I enclose 46 cents
for February, March, April. Through
the summer I’ll be at Nashville, Tenn.
Probably elsewhere in the fall.
I’m glad you own and control th®
magazine. A man of your individ
uality can run a business no other
way. I never allow any other man
to control one dollar of my money.
You are easily the first political
writer of America. No other writer
is now doing so much to shape its
political thought.
I agree with you on every phase
of the great questions of the day ex
cept expansion. I believe emphatical
ly in spreading Americanisms. The
how is insignificant. It was this
that made the Democratic party
great. Under Bryan she let the Re
publicans steal her Aladdin’s lamp.
You are a lawyer. I believe no
other nation has so many different
courts of justice as ours. It seems
to me there should be a simplifying
and uniformity of these mills of the
gods.
Write a full, clear, exhaustive ar
ticle on the Judiciary and courts of
our nation.
I’ve greatly desired to see some
thing on this for years. All I can get

Hon. Thomas Watson:
I am now and have been a subscrib
er to Watson’s Magazine. My time will
expire about May 1, 1907. I no
ticed in my November number that
you were no longer connected with it.
I also received a circular letter ask
ing me to take $lO worth of stock,
the editor assuring me that they still
intended to make the magazine a suc
cess. I am honest in saying that I
subscribed for the magazine because
Tom Watson was Editor and for no
other reason.
I do not want Watson’s Magazine
with Tom Watson left out, and I am
confident more than ninety per cent
of the people are with me on this
proposition. I did not take any stock
nor do I want any, as the magazine
now stands I would not pay the pos
tage on it. I am and have always been
a Democrat, but lam a Democrat up
on principle and for party’s sake, and
I can give honor where honor is due.
I believe that your magazine was do
ing a power of good. Your writings
have the true and honest Democratic
ring in them and the people are be
ing aroused. They recognize in you
a true reformer, and I am glad to
know that you will continue the mag
azine under a new name, Watson’s
Jeffersonian Magazine, and I predict
for your new magazine unbounded
prosperity.
1 believe all of your old subscrib
ers will reuew r with you and will help
you to advertise your new Magazine.
I saw a copy of your first number and
I was so well pleased with it I de
cided to write you and propose to
get you up a club here. 1 think I can
easily get you quite a number in a
short time. If you will kindly send
me an agent’s outfit and terms I will
see what I can do toward extending
the influence of Watson’s Jefferson
ian Magazine. Wishing you suc
cess in this new venture and assuring
you of my highest esteem and best
wishes, I am very truly,

A FATAL DEFECT.
(From The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.)
A story is told that when Senator
Beveridge was in New Mexico and
Arizona several years ago he was ten
dered $5,000 worth of stock In a mine
there as a present, but the senator,
according to the story, declined to
accept. It is further related that that
stock is now worth $1,500,000. The
fatal defect in the story is the fact
that there has been no such rise In
stocks in any mine in that region in
the period named.
