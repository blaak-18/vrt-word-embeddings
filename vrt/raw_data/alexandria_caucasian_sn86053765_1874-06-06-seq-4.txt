Boils— A Sad Story.
The following affecting recital of
bodily aiid mental suffering is giv
en by a resident of Cooperstown,
1ST. Y., through the columns ot the
Plainfield Register. A man with a
, boil on his thight could hardly bo
expected to bo onj^ood terms with
anybody :
Dear Register : —Useless ! useless Î
If I've tried once I have tried a do
/.eu times to sit down and write you
a regular old scalp-peeler of a let
ter. It Isn't that I love Caesar less
—1 meau it isn't that 1 am not able
to do the mental part of the propo
sition, but it is that I am unable to
ßit down.
o
Dow common the written sen
ience, 1 sit down to pen a few lies
—1 mean-lines, etc. But how much
unwritten anguish may result from
the attempt !
How gladly I would say. it if
J could, " It is with pleasure, dear
Kcgister, that I sit down to an
nounce to you the arrival of a boy/'
etc. But, good gods, how can I ?
The thought of sitting down makes
me boil. The thought of ihe boil
prevents my tilting. The fact of
the boil makes me mad. And the
act of sitting makes me leap like
unto a hurried sky-rocket.
Why, my love, 1 havn't sat down
in Ave weeks—or in anything else
—to stay ! 1 am a most miserable,
miserable man.
Along at first I-tried to. clo my
writing for the Atlantic Monthly
. (ssh !) standing at my desk, but be
coming absorbed in tlmughts of
those things that are before, and
'brgetting those things which are
behind, i.would pull forward my
tall desk-stool and settle. Then J
would unsettle, quick.
And these would follow a
a prolonged and dismal howl of
< pain, a wild tramping to a fro; one
arm waving like our banner m the
sky, the other holding the panta
loons away l'rom t in; cause of ati my
agony.
o
o
Ho behold me now, supported un
der my arms by my Revolutionary
grandmother's quilting frames,!
which reaeh from piano to mantle
piece ; with a pair of light summer
trousers on, which arc kept dis
tended aud away from J hat boil by
a fish-hook, a <*ord and a staple in
:ho wall—aH drawn taut.
And ye.t J am not happy, Why,
if United .Sunes Treasury Spinner
should say to me,'* Jlerc, (îeorge,
sit, down on this half-cord of green
baekfj, and they are yours," I should
■tiiHwer, " Go 'way, Spinner ; tdon'tj
want your ducats; i am not hun
gry.• 'Tend to yOni ox>o knitting:
I know business.''
JVly wife, says my afflict ion ought
to develop*- any religion is ten<leue\
that maj lay dormant in me. She
thinks it has In th« 1 eai lier stages
of my sufferings she says she awoke-!
one silent night .nul heard me she;
was sure, quoting .Scripture audj
Watts' hymn«.

thing, ■/. c.. mifing iVom profane

ty Six colored men and one white
man were wldpped and pilloried on
Saturday, injtbo jail yard at Newcaetlo" r
Del., in tlie nresenco of a large crowd.
One coloredlnan had been twice whip

only case of.tho kind on record. Lewis

assault on a little girl will be whipped
on Saturday next.
