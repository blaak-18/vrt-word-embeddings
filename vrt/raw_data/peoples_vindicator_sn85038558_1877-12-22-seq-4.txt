of James McC(lendon was signed by ,
Gov. Nicholls on the 30th nit., fixing ,
Friday, December 14, as the day of tli
execution, and designating as thle s
place the space in front of the parish to

one of the farmers for this country. ci

RI( LANI :-W-\Ve learn that a negro a'
boy about five or six years old was t(
burned to death in a house on the N
place of Abe Jenkins, near lied r
Month, on Friday night or Saturday
morning before day. Abe Jenkins, Li
who is a colored man, informns us that sI
he went off to sit all with a corpse, tI
leaving a colored woman there who
locked up the house witlh her little
boy in it and went off. Thie house is
supposed to hlave taken fire from a n
defective chimney. Everything was a
burned up with the house.-B,con. it
RAPIDES :-A most disastrous and I:
damaging fire, on Wednesday, the
5th, occurred on Avoca Plantation, ti
the home of Captain James Jeffries. tl
The large and tine Gin house was the c,
first to burn downi, which was follow
ed by the Corn Crib and Saw Mill
and almost the entire Cabins on the s
place. The wind was blowing almost 'I
a hurricane at the time, and no head- c
way could be made against the flames. it
Besides all this loss of valuable prop
erty, Captain Jeffries suffers still g
more in the loss of his corn and thir- I
ty bales of cotton.-Democrat.
ST. LANoDR:-Notwithstanding the t
numerous convictions of criminals at v
the present term of the District Court, r
there are evidently a number of
scamps still at large in this vicinity
who are maneuvering in a way that 0
will eventually land tliem in the pen- p
itentiary if they are not careful. We t
have within the past few days heard
of several cases of cattle stealing in
the immediate vincinity of town. '
On another occasion a four year old I
heifer of a good dairy stock retutned Il
home bleeding profusciy and carrying
a bullet in her head. Another in
stance was tihe wounding of a finea
young milchi cow, whlichl came home
and died shortly afterwards. Tlhese
occurrences took place in the day
time and but a very short distance
from town. The abiding places of
these fireelooters can be easily guess
ed, and a little close watclhing might
reveal their identity and be the means
of reinforcing the railroad brigade by
a few more first-class recruits.-Cou
rier,
AVOYELLES :-Young men should
not congregate in front of tile Cathlo
lic Church during service, as the noise
that they create interferes with the
ceremonies, and besides this is no
place for idlers. Inside of the Churclh
young mnen is thie proper place for you.
The Republicans of this parish are
earger to espouse any cause tlhat purom
ises relief from their political woes.
Yesterday it was the Workingmaun's
movement, to day it is the Liberal
party, and tihe morrow must care for
itself. Despondency with them is
general, and we would like to keep
them in just this frame of mind for
the next generation.-Bulletim.

* [N. O. Democrat.]
Thle history of Kellogg in this State
is replete with frauds, machinations,
venality,and every vice of a corrupt
and unscrupuloeus trickster and par
tisan. Is is not a duty the Senate
owes to its own dignity and reputa
tion as well as to the Republic to
make inquiry into these misdeeds of
one of its members t When it can
be shown tlhat hie obtained his admis
sion into the Senateby tihe most fla
grant bribery and corruption; that
through such means he managed to
hold his seat in tihe Senate ftr four
years; that whlen forced into tihe
gubernatorial chair of this State by
Federal bayonets he was the chief
ooncoctor of various fraudulent con
spiracies which have resulted in tihe
large increase of the public debt, and
that lie closed his usurped guberna
torial career by a collusion withl an
auditor who was his tool and the
agent of his financial plots, to plunder
and make way with the archives of
the State and thus destroy the evi
,Auco of his numerous malversation;
when these and a hundred other like
crimes against the State can be dis
tinctly brought home to him, can any
man worthy to wear the Senatorial
robes, and to be looked up to witlh
the reverence due to the Conscript
Fathers of the Republic, regard with
out a blush this occupation of one of
tile Senatorial chairs by William Pitt
Kellogg.

Geo. Drary, one of the members of

From the Shreveport Timel'. of the

It might have beeni the true policy for
the ofli als of this State to suspend the F

cilssion of thile se-natorial iliuestioii, thoiugh
wIe have iialwayIs doliubted the wisldom i4'

thing mnle ihetinito. NV apprehlend that ii
that a1s toiliv h (idi tiial has too artfi ll' l
evelr'i'd his tracks for the col'rts to reach
hint. If not 'it him he reached, anti let
.Jiudge Sipoltllrd take the seat to which
ihe' is jinstly entitled.
The-re is another 11istioni which imight
well le looked into and defihitelhy set
thled. \We in this portioln of tlhe viniiarid
know that Miaijore .lion inr shtnilll to-flay Bi

let the court decide it without fmlthet'r

Thie truth is, and it must be told i
sooneir or later, that the lpr'esenit State
C
adminiiistrationi is thoroughly sat lila
ted with ; is, as it were, the tool of the
New O)rleans business anid ibrokers

to let the whole State go down the

Tlie "business interests" of New
Orleans has lbeen to this State a living i
curse, and is daniied from one end of
it to the other. * Warnionth aind Kel- -
logg had full support fi'ronm these gen- hi
try, and the feeitul public dcebt of
the State is an evidence, shanieful to
conitemniplate, of the patriotlism of this
class of slippered gentry--full oitf wise
saws, and with capon lined stoniach.
t The lpresent admiiinistration has fallen
coimpletely into their hands, and un
less something is done to stop this
gush and come down to work, the
Radicals trill yet this State next year.
We are no alarmist. We but speak
the truth, and every good man in the
t ate will bear witness that we are
right. Fifty thousand honest, hard
working white men, are being sold
Sout of house and home in order to
gather in monies to pay interest upon
debts heaped upon us by Radical
thieves, and to fling out as high sala- S
ries to officials who are in the wairnm
I nests and big pay made by Radical
Slaws.
S And what is the administration do
ing in all this ruin I Letting out con
tracts to build levees, and hunting up
negroes to put on School Boards in
order to give the "colored people
their rights."
Sentiment and gush rules the hour.
Everybody, hhack and white are get
ting their rights-and the taxpayet is
- getting most beautifully robbed.
This thing must come to a halt.
d Nobody is going to deprive the negro
of one jot or tittle! of what are his
* rights, and the negro knows it as well
as we do. But the taxpayer demands
b some consideration, and lie wants to
n. know w'lat is going to 1)e done for
e him. Sentiment wont do in his case.
He insists on practical work. No
'more stopping the spiggot and al
l lowing the hung to waste economy
for him. This State must come
down to pan rock, and that quick.
A&wful, butCorrcct.
[Marshall (Tex) lHerald.]
The Shreveport Times begins to
think that the State authorities of
Louisiana have committed an error in
t not prosecuting promptly the leading
s, radical officials of that State. It oc
pt curs to the editor that Gov. Hampton's
r- course has been much wiser. Now
te that Judge Spofford has been unjustly
a deprived of his seat in the Senate, the
t most vigorous action is recommnended.
o This is all very well, but we fear it is
n too late to effect results that might
s- have been attained without difliculty,
a- if the Demiocrats had done their Auty.
at We predicted that the first niove
to made after the re-establishment of
ur honest government would have been
Ic the prosecution of the men that tyr
by anized over the people and plundered
if them of their substance. We were
n- mistaken. The State is ruled by New
he Orleans, and that city, like all others,
ud where commercial men have the sway
a- exercises neither common sense nor
an integrity or political management.
le "Great cities," said Mr. Jefferson a
lr century ago, "are the cesspools of
of iniquity." It is certain that wherev
i- er they have the rule, a free people
a; suffer. T'ie Times fears that Kellogg
ke in his rascality has "covered up his
s. tracks." He is mistaken. That has
never been done yet. Scoundrels
ml never fail to leave the gaps down. All
th that is required is to get the proper
pt ment to hunt up the evidence. But
ti- t displace and punish him is tar more
of difficult now than if the State officials
itt had acted promptly, and at the right
time.
Indignant.
[Marksville Bulletin]
of But rather than lose their power,
a- Republican Secators did not hesitate
to take in fellowship a man whom
Louisiana has repudiated as a Gov
ernor, and in whom they have not a
particle of con fdence. Let this man's
e admission stir up and excite the in
dignation of all honorable men, for it
ly is nothing less than an infamous plot
. against liberty and decency.
