and property of every description,
real, personal and mixed, are but a
trust fund for the political power, like
the functions of a public office. The
judicia-personage, the corporation,
created by the sovereign power ex
pressly for this sole purpose and for
no other, is in the most strict, techni
cal and qualified sense, but its trustee.
This is the primary and sole legal,
political motive for its creation. The
incidental interest and profits of in
dividuals are accidents, not in theory
and practice. Every farthing of
its tolls is first to be devoted to pay
ing the public tax, and to the continu
ance of the road, its ample equipment
and regular operation as the inter
ests of the community, not those of
the shareholders, demand.”
To tell these overlords of rails and
road beds, that these patient creatures
they have Ijeen jamming into decay
ing and filthy cars; these docile hu
man beings they have been hurling to
death through rotten bridges; are
their masters with rights superior to
the lucre laden magnates of water
logged stocks, is new talk that will
require a readjustment of my attic
furniture before I can find room to
permanently stow it.
It’s strange, but I like it.
And to think that the words are
quoted. Which means that they have
been used before.
Well, that proves how much my im
mense lack of information has cost
me.
That such words as these were ever
used, except in political party plat
forms, was never dreamed of in my
philosophy—Horatio.
This decision puts the railroad
question just where it ought to be.
It is the most important decision
ever handed down by a Florida court.
It settles the transportation prob
lem. And settles it right.
It really makes no difference these
days how you used to line up in poli
tics —whether you were a Democrat
or a Republican or a Populist, or any
other old thing, if you get to thinking
on x Üblic questions you will find your
self agreeing, in the main, with all
other people~who allow themselves to
think freely and clearly and without
regard to how some other persons are
going to think about the way they
think.
Tom Johnson, millionaire and
Democrat, .thinks about public ques
tions. So does Bob LaFollette, poor
man and Republican. And when you
read the thoughts of Johnson and La
Follette, they are very much alike on
public questions.
Cummings, governor of lowa, is a
|rich man and a Republican; Tom
Watson, writer down in Georgia, is
comparatively a poor man and a Popu
list; yet these two think alike, and
this last pair think very much like the
first pair.
A Republican legislature in Nebras
ka solemnly declared for the two-cent
rate for railroad fare. Another Re
publican resolution in a Republican
legislature, this time in lowa, wants
the election of United States senators
by popular vote and the two-cent
fare besides.
The truth about the matter is that
there is only one side to public ques
tions these days, and every man who
thinks about them gets on that side.
This side is—
That it’s about time for the people
to assert their inherent power to rule,
and wrest the control of this country
from the trusts, corporations and
.otther powers that prey.

BROWNLOW ON ANDREW JOHN
SON.
Washington, Feb. 23. —Over Moun
tain Hill, near Greenville, Tenn., the
last resting place of Andrew Johnson,
a storm of oratory broke forth today,
while the house committee of the whole
was discussing the sundry civil bill.
The place was made a national ceme
tery long ago, and there is a para
graph in the budget carrying $32,000
for a superintendent’s lodge, road
ways, walks and closing walls.
Mr. Gardner, of Michigan, moved
that the paragraph be stricken out for
the reason that only four Union soldiers
are buried there. He said the appro
priation really was an ingenious way
of taking care of the grave of Andrew
Johnson.
Mr. Brownlow, of Tennessee, who
represents the district once represent
ed by Andrew Johnson, spoke earnest
ly against the motion. He told the
story of what East Tennessee had
done for the Union army. “The con
gressional district of which Green
ville is the center,” said Mr. Brown
low, “sent more men to battle for the
Union than any other congressional
district in the country and they were
100 miles ’within the Confederate
lines.”
Passing to a discussion of Johnson,
Mr. Brownlow said amidst great ap
plause, “In my opinion Johnson was
the greatest patriot of the civil war.”
Gardner’s motion was defeated in a
vast chorus of “noes.”
