WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1876.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humllorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and dontinued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shamus by its
nlasterly cartoons and pungelt editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and wap recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demnd, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnissh illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet knowp to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-clase
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidions.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERs f" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vix
soAR Bi'Rss in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a ' gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALt
ER'S VINEGAR Birras are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laza
tire, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

fiul Invigor;it that ever sustained
the sinking systemn.
No Person can take these Bit:
ters according to directions. and re

bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wt teaf nerond repair.
Bilous, tenlittent, and In.
ternittent Fevers, which are so
Drevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especiarly those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and reinarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
r heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive dlchnge
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WALKE:'S VINEGAR
Burruas, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the samne time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy funo
tions of the dligestive organs.
Fortify the bodiy against dis
ease by purifying all its ftuids with

constitutional Diseases, WALKKIr'S Vix

intractable cases.
For Inflamnmatory and Chronie

Jas, Itch, Scurfs, Discolorations of the
Skin, mlnors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature. are literally
dug up and carried out.of the systemn in a
short time by the ause of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other WVormns,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
mored. No system of medicine, no ver
nifnges, no anthelminitic. will free the
system from worms like these Bitters.
For RelnaleColplasint, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn o[
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ie Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever j'bu find its ilmpurities barsting
through the skin in Pimples, Emruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you tind it ob.
strueted and sluggish ill the veins; cleanse
it wheni it is foul; your feelings will tell
you whoen. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
