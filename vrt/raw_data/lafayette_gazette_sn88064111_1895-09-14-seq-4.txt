If The Advertiser is correct, our
friends of the opposition may be
dubbed the "cremators."
The esteemed editor of our hy.
phenated comtemporary compares
himself to a buzz-saw. Bad man,
Goolsby, bad man.
The Democrat-Journal, of Mans
field, is in favor of prohibition.
SWe thought Bro. Mac was Irish.
State Senator G. WV. Montgomery
is mentioned among the candidates
for governor. The Senator is re
puted to be an intelligent and hon
orable gentleman, but his chances
to reach the gubernational chair are
rather slim at the present time.
WVe learn that Wm. B. Eastin is a
eandidate for clerk of court of St.
Martin parish. Should the voters
of that parish elect Mr. Eastin they
will have one of the most compe
tent officials in the State. He is
not only thoroughly qualfied to
fill the office to which he aspires,
but is a Democrat of the "'Old
Hickory" kind.
At a recent rural prayer meeting
the minister said. "'Will brother
Smith lead in prayer? Seven men
arose and began praying at once. -
This embarrassed the preacher, and
he said hurriedly: "I meant
Brother John Smith !" At this an
nouncement one sat down and five
more got up and began praying.
The preacher saw his mistake, said
nothing and let the eleven pray it
out among themselves.
Judge I-I. D. Smith, the champ
ion t"crop reporter," who knows
less about politics than any other
man residing in the parish of St.
Mary (so he says), was in the city
This morning and was around to
call on Governor Foster at Hotel
Royal. It is presumed that the
judge and the governor had a long
confab over "crop prospects."
Daily States.
Our highly esteemed friend, Van
der Cruyssen, of The Advertiser,
turned himself loose in last Satur
day's issue and told how it is pro
prosed to reduce the present State
and pal ish administrations and all
their supporters "to dust." When
the time comes for the general cre
mation we sincerely hope our usual
:ly humane neighbor will spare us,
if simply through a fraternal senti
men t.
The sympathy of fair-minded
people go to Mr. Stansbury in his
presc;.t difficulty with Mr. O'Malley
of The Iten.. No man with a
particle of manhood would submit
to being abused and caricatured as
Mr. Stansbury has been by The
item. Not satisfied with charging
l.im with all the crimes in the cal
endar The Item has called attention
to his unfortunate physical deftrm
ity. The Gazette has admired the
course of The Item in its fight
against the boodlers, but no decent
man or respectable journal will for
a moment sanction this reckless
abuse of a man and wicked defama
tion of his character.
I/VERY TRUE.
The following from the Baton
Rouge Advocate is so uncontrovert
ibly true that we reproduce it. An
old broken down politician or some
one with an ax to grind generall)
rushes into print under a non de
plume, because his name signed to
an article would divest it of all force
and interest:
'1 he season has now arrived when
the old broken dovn political hacks
are filling the newspapers great and
small with their effusions over some
such signature as Democrat, Tax
payer,. V'oter, Progress, lustice, and
so on . a /n/initum ad nauscum.n.
W'her, a man's office hunting pro
t-livities becomec so well known that
the people discredit everything lhe
says, and his signature to a news
paper article no longer interests the
public sufficiently to induce them to
lead it, it is then that he seeks
retugve bciilnd all sorts of catchy ti
tles to force hi-mself upon the pub
lic attention. In purely literary
contributions the non de /lume finds
 :its justification on the score o1
.' Ilnotlesty, but its employment in po
]itical controversies in this age of
Sbthe world and in free America is an
aitrocious anachronism that should
t be' counitenanced by progressive
-.mpers. It is nothing short of
p|li~ical bushwhacking and no self
respectinfg newspaper should allowv
its columns to be made the medium
through which to disseminate the
billingsgate that constitutes the
usual stock-in-trade of tlis brood of
skulking jayhawers.
BACK TO THfE FARMS.
Springfield Republican.
A movement of population from
the cities back into the country is
noted in Minnesota. The Minne
apolis Tribune regards this reces
sion in urban growth as an en
couraging sign, and so it probably
is. We shall be much surprised if
our own Massachusetts census does
not exhibit a similar population
movement in progress here. All
over the country the drift to the
cities has been too general and ex
tensive for a decade and a half past
to meet the demands of a natural
and healthful adjustment between
populations engaged in agriculture
and populations engaged in manu
facturing, transportation, and pro
fessional and personal services.
The latter avenues of employment
have been terribly overcrowded and
the coming on of hard times has
compelled something of a halt in
this remarkable march of the popu
lation to the cities.
Fifty years ago economists esti
mated that about one-half of the
working population of a country
which was self-sufficient in all lines
of industry would be needed on the
farms to establis a healthy indus
t ial equilibrium. Since then there
has been such improvement in ma
chinery for farm work and its appli
cation in America to such advan
tage on broad areas of rich virgin
soil as to materially modify this es
timate for the United States in par
ticular. That is to say, the same
number of men engaged on the soil
can to-day produce a much larger
quantity of food and raw material
for manufacturing than they could
50 years ago. But since America
is prodncing a vastly larger quan
tity of food and raw material than
it uses-is doing agricultrial work
for a considerable body of manu
facturing located outside the coun
try-we should say that, notwith
standing the improvements in farm
machinery, an estimate of 50 per
cent for t'he population which sh old
be at work on the fa ms in the
United States tinder natural and
healthful industrial conditions was
none too high. And yet the census
of x89o shows, in a bulletin lately
published, that hardly 40 per cent.
of the working population was at
that time engaged on the farms.

It is a well-knon fact that there are thousands of men in all parts of the United States who. by
systematic trading through Chicago brokers, make large amounts every year. rauging from a few thou

It is also a fact that those who make the largest profits from comparatively small investments on this

systematic trading.
