There must be a stop put to the
- appointment machine in New Or.
leans, else trouble will occur in this
parish instead of peace. Our under.
standing of the adjustment was,
that concesseons were to be mutual,
and all parties were to strive by acts,
as well as words, to bring about an
era of peace and prosperity in Len
isiana. Gor. Kellogg seems to have
fallen back into his old groove as far
I as regards this parish, and is either
11 under the thumbs of lionllt, Myers,
o Pierson and Blunt, or he is determin
ed that he will concede nothing, but
will go on endeavoring to exasper
ate all honest men by the appoint
ment of unqualified persons to office.
His action in the commissioning of
a Clerk of the District Court tor this
parish, has caused an alarm to our
people, for it has been said all along
that Kellogg would never keep faith
with us, and it now looks very much
as if he did not intend to. Ezernack,
the appointee, is totally incompetent,
and in that, lacks one of the capaci
ties which our people are determined
shall alone give preferment in future.
' The fact of his appointing a compe
tent Deputy, will not suffice to quiet
us. Why not appoint that Deputy,
Swho is a Republican, competent and
al in every way satisfactory to the tax
payers, the District Clerk ?
r- If peace is desired here, Gov. Kel
it, logg most meet our people or their
representatives, half way. This con
e sultation with unauthorized individ
Snals will not be binding upon the
people, and in the interest of peace
and the spirit of a fair adjustment,
we insist upon its being done, else we
will be as stubborn as Kellogg, and
3, he will find that w. will not bb forced
)2 into measures. in the end. The Radi.

The Chicago .' Tii e th leading
Radical paper of the NorthLest, oc
casionally blurts out the truth in a
way lot altogether complimentary to
some of its Louisiana pat~t friends.
Here is what it ias to say about the
unseating of Sypher and the admis
sion of George A. Sheridan into the
House of Representatives:
Among thie men who Ave tbeen
conspicuous in Congress, and offen
sively conspicuous, was one J. H.
Sypher, holdinlg a eat as i inesiber
from the city of Nety' Orleans. This
man never was elected, an dthat fa
has been notorious t..every. member
of the House from thise rest day of
meeting. Yet the House permitted
him to retain his seat to the exclusion
of the man rightfully elected until
the last hours of the session, when
the y declared him never' to
nave been elected, and then adnmitted
the rightful claimant. Sypher in the
meantime has drawn hie two years'
salary.
At the same time, the HusPe ad
mitted Mr. Sheridae to a 'seat from
New Orleans. In 1?72, Pnchbback
was a candidate at large for Congt~sq
on the Kellogg ticket; in. counting in
Kellogg and the others, Pinchback
was also counted in.. Subsequently
Pinchback was elected to the Senate
by the Kellogg Legislature, and has
spent two yoears. vainly trying tq gget
into that body. The House haq kept
the place vacant for two ears,. for
the reason, .it was alleged, to ad
mit Pinchbeck, should ho. absadon
the claim to a seat in the Senate, and
in the aneantime bhas eclded Sher
idan, who had been'lawfully elected,
At the last moment the House' ad
mitted Sheridan. It is har(lly .-es
sary to comment on this gross lit
ice, and we refer to it .more particu
larly at this time as another evidence
give .by the House that the election
of the Kellogg ticket in Louisiana in
1872' was, to say the least, very, du
bious. The House at last. repudiated
Pinehbeck's election to, that body as
the act of a fragidleantl-elected
Legislatuae. Justice', t i has
been done, but, it ha~~ep tardy just

Mr, C. J. C. Packette has reently x
been appointed tax collector for the
4 parish of Natchitoches, by Gov. Kel- .
logg, and will soon open his office for
the eallecti6n of taxes.
H6 informs us that he will refuse
s to collect the special judgment. tax of
40 nills, levied on the rolls of 1873,
Snales compelled by the courts. In
doing se, he not only follows his own
Slneliastieon to relieve the people of
a emerous burden, but aries out t
the iastruetilms of the Auditor, Is- i
s: aed in 1874, and consults the wishes
. of Gov. Kellogg in the mnatter.
In adopting this coUoe, Mr. Puck
Seott loes not wish to, be considered 1
as fivoring the repudiation of this
a debt. He hopes that some adjust
ment will be made between the judg- I
amet creditors and the tax payers, on
some fair and equitable basis. But
Sin th event no agreement san be
' dq, he will take the side of the
tax payers, sad let those who an in
a teroeudd in the collection of the jadg
- ment tax appeal to the courts for
a relief.

Telegraphlc.
PaRDEE's CONFIRMATION REPORT
ED. - Telegraphic advices received
Friday morning by prominent Re- a
publicans Pre to the effect that Par
dee's confirmation was decided upon kI
by the Republican senatorial caucus k
on Thusday night, and dispatches are e
momentarily expected from Wash
ington confirming those already re- b
ceived.
Concord, N. H., March 13.-The I
latest figures give the house 191 re- t
publicans and 179 democrats and four a
towns unheard from. The Senate b
stands five and five, with no choice -'
by the people in two districts. The i
council stands three democrats and y
two republicans. In a vote of 78,000 i
for governor the plurality will pot l
reach one hundred. Neither have a b
majority. Two democrots and one p
republican are elected to Congress. 0
Dover, Del., March 13.--A State
Senator gave notice he would ask
permission to bring in a bill entitled d
an act in relation to certain classes of
persons exercising public employ
ments. The bill provides that keep
ers of hotels, taverns, &c., 'shall not
be obliged by law to furnish refresh
ment or entertainment to persons
whose reception or refreshment will
be offensive to a majority or part of
the customers or injure' business.
Similar provisions provide for places
of amusement aud'carriers of paesn- c
gers.
Rome, March 13-Count Mare Fos
ky, noble guard serving the P'ope
will start from Rome immediately for
New York, bearing official notifica
tion to Archbishop MeClosky of his
elevation to Cardinal, and in a few
days subsequently abblegate. Mgr.
Reacotliwill follow with the Cardi
nal's hat.
New Orleans, March 16.-Marshall
Packard telegraphs Governor Kellogg
that the arbitration gives the conser
vatives eight majority in the House. c
Governor Kellogg to-day signed t
the death warrant of Isham Brown,
colored, convicted of the murder of
James W. Clinton, a leading lawer of k
Tensas parisl, in December last.
Friday, April 16th, is named for the
etecution.
New York, March 16.-As most of 1
the papers submitted to the Louisiana
Committee had been thoroughly ex
amined on Friday and Saturday, and (
elaims of contestants nearly all de
eided, the business of the members
yesterday morning consisted chiefly
in preparing their reports. The ses
sion was strictly private. At the
close of the session, Mr. Wheeler in
formed representatives of the press I
that the committee had closed inves- 1
tigation and made awards in cases of
nineteen itpresentatives, w hse s e
claims were submitted to their arbi- I
tration. From all the evidence which
had come into their possession as
well as during the previous investiga
tion-of election, he said the members
of the committee had unanimously
agreed in their award, but for reasons
w-rich the public could appreciate, it 1
had been decided not to make the 1
report of heir deliberations known
at present. He said the award of the
committee would be- forwarded at <
once to the Governor, with duplicate .
teturns of elections submitted to them
for examination, and that a special
session of the House of Representa
tives of Louisiana wouald be eonven- 1
ed for the purpoae of taking action in
the matter. He could not say how 1
sen ebthiwould he effected, bat bop- I
.dthe deciaien at which they had ar- 1
rived would be approved. It had
been nagreed upon after a moest care
fal examinationisto the facts of each
particular case and was based on in
partial judgment of members of ar
bitrating committee. He said he re-I
petted very amuh that he could not
afurnish any partilatrs e the pas
as the circumstances of the case ren
dered it necessary that the awards
should not be made publio until the
lower house of the Louisiana Legis
lature shoald b e prepared to take
Anal action isa the matter. It rested
entirely With thlt'body to confirm the
eompromis, which had been agreed
upon. It is raderstood that Mr.
Wheeler will preseut a report to the
HeMa of Bepresentativmes, when al
sleeial session is eonveied for that 1
purpose. Although nothing of a
deiaite character could be ascertain
ed from members of the arbitration
committee, it seems to be generally
understood by the counsel in the case
that the demoorats will gain a hum
ber of seats through the compromise.
We consider that comment is un.
aecessary upon the testimony, now
being published, of H. C. Myers, and
others o pis class frol our parish.
The history of this man is well known
to all the world that cares to know,
sad the. evidiUee givn by him is one
ass of, downright falsehooeed. He
plundered dtie school funds to the ex
tent of 0,00;  was Boullt's right
hand manlpulator in stealing other
parish funds; and acted forthe whole
ridg as Parish and District Judge, in
either overlng their crns, or as
lstlng to forgo new steaslinag bills for
Polo. JUries and Legslature.

for this parish, if taken asu an evi.:

in earrymlag oat the popoed adUt"t

affliction sent to his family. Imagine, e,
bub, the terrible grief of his gray
haired partner, the tears and sobs of
-his children! Picture the scene to ci
yourself. It is dark: a happy family a
has gathered around a cheerful stove t
hearth. They are waiting for bus
band asd father to ariive with four a
pounds of brown sugar, half a pound
of salaratus, five cents' worth of mo- o
lasses candy and three crash windows cl
and doors crying: 'Father has come!'
but a strange knock is heard. The u
door is opened, the man asks if Mr. n
Miller lives there, and then in a sad a
voice goes on to say that Mr. Miller t
is no more. a Detroit boy named Pat.
soy Hern having murdered him with P
a snow ball! Gaze on the picture, '
my son-imagine the sorrow and woe i
and desolation !"
"Oh I boo-hoo-woo !" wailed the
boy.
"Yoe see, my son, this world is be- C
coming crowded for room, and if each r
one of us goes through life kicking 1
and throwing, some one will get hurt.
Let yeaour mind dwell on these things,
my boy, and see if you can't get along I
after this,withoat trouble. You may
run home now, and if your father
ever bays you a hatchet, and you t
cut his cherry tree, don't lie out of *
it when he saks who's been backing ,
at his standing timber.
We entreat our farmers to plant a
corn more abundantly this year I
than in the past. There never
has been, to our knowledge, a
surplus of cerials made in this
parish, on the contrary, never
enough for consumption, and we
will never see prosperity or any I
thing like it so long as our corn
cribs and smoke houses are in the
West. It seems that experience I
teaches us nothing; lessons in <
abundance are given us, but we
do not profit by them. Last year
the crop of corn was short in
bushels although larger than usu
al in acreage, and we hope that
farmers will be guided by wisdom(
once, and plant a nufficiency to
yield a surplus, at any rate.
The most fertile lands on Cane,
fed River and the innumerable
bayous, are smilingly inviting the
hand of the plowman. Thousands
of acres untilled that will produce ,
40 to 50 bushels of corn, or a bale
of cotton per acre, and still white
people will settle upon the poor_
hill barrens, when by the labor
bestowed upon those poor farms,
if applied to the alluvial lands of]
the river, would yield them ten
fold. Now is the time for porl
uce to reap the harvest; the best
lands can be had for less than $15
per acre, and the chance to pro
care tsr will not occur againin a
century, perhaps.
To those farmers of the frozen
North, we extend a cordial invita
tion, and will take pleasure in im
parting such informttion as they
'desie.
The House Committe are bsly ea

are snlbstsatially correct. We may
