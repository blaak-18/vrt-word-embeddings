MONTGOMERY, La.. Oct. 21. 1894.
EDITOR POPULIST :
Well the problem for hard times is
settled. A merchant in Montgomery
took one of his customers into his ledg
er and showed him where he had lost
seventy (lays cowing to town after tobae
co. concentrated lye and sich." So all
the, worry may now cease Balm of
Gilead to a storm tossed people ' But
in two hours afterwards he explained to
another one who came growling about
hard times and who owed but little and
made big crops, that there was to d-n
much cotton made--over production.
Let us all now be thankful. The cause
discovered, very clear. Lazy, work
more. Industrious, produce less.
