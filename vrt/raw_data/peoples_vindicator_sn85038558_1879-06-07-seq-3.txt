Feast of Mirth and Fm-A
Side-Spllttlrg Farce,
Ete.
Monday night the 9th instant will be
hailed with delight by all lovers of true
genius, in the exhibition of the character
D'Ethiope. At 7 p. m., the doors of the
Firemen's Hall will open to the eager
and expectant crowd which will be
thronging barly to witness the inimit
able performance of the House Minstrel,.
From the nnmber of plays, songs, etc.,
that are booked on the programme, gives
ns a slight foretaste of the feast of mirth
and enjoyment that is in store for all
who attend on that occasion. Amidst
the worries and troubles of this life, it is
well that we should have an occasional
diversion, a few hours in which our
greivons burdens are lifted from our
shoulders, our troubles are forgotten, and
we can give vent to pleasure unalloyed.
iSuch diversions lengthens our dpcy. The
lhome Minstrels should he especially
patronised by the public of this town
and vicinity, because they are not travel
ing professionals and adventurers, but are
composed of our own citizens. The ad
mission is only 50 cents ; children under
twelve years 25 cents.
N. Tics.-The members of the Catholic
Aid Society are requested to meet at La
