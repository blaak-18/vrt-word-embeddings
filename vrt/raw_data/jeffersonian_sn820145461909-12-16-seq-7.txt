A METHODIST WHO STANDS HIS
GROUND.
Dear Sir:— a short time ago, Rev.
L. W. Moore, of Tallahassee, referred
to you in his sermon, and I told him
that he misquoted you in regard to
missions. So, a few days ago, he
sent me the inclosed clipping to try to
prove he did not. lam a steward in
the M. E. Church, and I have not
given anything to foreign missions in
several years. So the preachers do
all they can to convince me that I
am wrong. But I can’t see it like
they do.
Fraternally yours,
M. L. HINSON.
Concord, Fla., Nov. 9, 1909.
Answer.
The clipping enclosed by Bro. Hin
son was taken from the Wesleyan
Christian Advocate of October 15th
last. In that issue, R. C. Cleckler
apparently demonstrated that I had
lied on Dr. J. S. MacArthur, of New
York, and on Dr. Paul Wakefield, of
Springfield, Ill.; and had misquoted
Miss Helen Clark, of New York.
Every subscriber to this paper
who read our number for October
28th knows that, while Dr. Asa
Blackburn, instead of Dr. MacArthur,
made the statements concerning the
hideous.conditions in Chinese mis
sions, Dr. MacArthur had said virtual
ly the same thing. The exact lan
guage which Dr. MacArthur used in
talking to the reporter of the New
York World is given in this week’s
Jeffersonian, and those statements
coincide with what Dr. Blackburn
said.
As to Dr. Paul Wakefield, he was
chased off the field, entirely. In
contestible evidence was produced to
prove that Paul was correctly report
ed by .Charles Bowers, the Craw
fordsville reporter, and by Mrs. Man
sell, wife of the Christian minister
in whose church Dr. Wakefield lec
tured. Although his character for
truth and veracity was at stake, Dr.
Wakefield was unable to produce any
evidence whatever to support his de
nials. It should have been the easiest
matter in the world for him to have
secured letters from some of the
people who heard that Crawfords
ville lecture.
As to Miss Helen Clark, she repu
diated a portion of the newspaper
reports of her interview, but she ad
hered to her strong opposition to the
system which allots a white girl to
each Chinaman. But she did not
deny having made use of the follow
ing terrible words, —
“For 17 years I have urged the
folly of white women endeavoring to
Christianize Chinese men. All about
me I have seen the ruin and wrecked
homes. I have believed from the
very beginning that it was impossi
ble for white women to properly in
fluence Chinese men.
“It is the attraction of sex that
predominates in both cases, not that
of religion. Despite all that is in the
papers, the public does not see the
other side —the Chinese side. The
pictures that I have seen are of
young, vain, frivolous white women
deliberately flirting with and leading
on their Chinese pupils.”
Mrs. Florence Todd had been re
ported as saying about the same
things that Miss Clark repudiated;
and Mrs. Todd, a noted missionary
worker of great experience, has not
.retracted or disclaimed the state
ments credited to her.
I also introduced Mrs. Charlotte
Smith, President of thq Woman’s
National Industrial League, who
testified that —•
“They” (the Chinese) “ can never
be Christianized.”
This lady spoke of the horrible
degradation of the white women,
who had become the victims of Chi
nese men. Mrs. Smith declared that
these white women became disciples
of Confucius, attended the joss
houses, and were the mothers of pa
gans.
I t>ENT MY DEFENSE TO DR.
W. C. LOVETT, EDITOR OF THE
ADVOCATE, AND HE REFUSED
TO PUBLISH IT.
Methodists who read Dr. Lovett’s
paper have good grounds for believ
ing me to be a malicious liar. THE
DOCTOR ALLOWS THE SCO
VILLES, THE TOW SONS AND THE
CLECKLERS TO ASSAIL ME; AND
HE HITS ME A FEW, HIMSELF, —
BUT HE DENIES ME THE RIGHT
TO REPLY.
\ What do you think of that?
A SATISFIED SUBSCRIBER.
Dear Sir: —I have been taking
your Magazine for some time, and in
no other do I find such able edito
rials. You have hit the nail on the
head on “Foreign Missions”, “Social
ism”, etc. If we had more editors
like you, we would have a better
country. In my opinion, you are the
best writer not only of the South,
but of America, and I am justly
proud that you are a Georgian.
Respectfully,
H. H. DAVIS.

IMPOSSIBLE TO GET COMPLAINTS
INVESTIGATED.
Editor Jeffersonian: —I beg space
in your valuable paper again, not for
notoriety, but simply to push the
betterment of things for, the unfor
tunate inmates whom I emphatically
do know have not received proper
attention from physicians. Employ
ees who are cruel, unscrupulous and
indifferent as to doing their duty
have been the rule of Asylum em
ployees at Milledgeville, Georgia.
It is impossible for a patient while
under the control of officials, or the
management, as it existed while I
was there, to get an investigation
of any complaint, consequently,
abuses and lack of proper care to
ward the unfortunates constantly
prevail.
Now, harping on one thing I al
ways despised. I would rather fight
any time, but I know something.
Seven years’ experience, and per
fectly rational from first entrance in
the Asylum, led me to observe
closely every tact.
I don’t believe in hiding and
shielding anything that’s wrong,
especially where demented beings,
still human and with feelings, suffer.
I was treated badly, not that I
disobeyed any rules. I was seriously
ill myself, and was grossly neglected.
I have those physicians’ names, but
refrain from giving them; also
those of neglectful attendants, not
through fear but simply hoping the
Legislature will establish some
"cans by which all will be under
surveillance so far as being com
pelled to perform duties promptly
toward those helpless patients, both
men and women.
Plainly speaking, there should be
CH)e Jeffersonian
some changes in the medical staff
f the Milledgeville Asylum. There
is no treatment given for nervous
diseases. One prescription regularly
used is knocking you down. It sure
ly causes the heart to flutter, but
has a soothing effect. A physician
of Macon has a son at the Asylum,
or did when I was there. I thought
sure he would be killed. Employees
are trusted with swabbing of throats,
and using washes on patient’s eyes
when really this should be done by
the physician in charge of the hall.
Half the time, medicine is not given
to patients by the attendants, though
having been prescribed. This is true.
Reading in the Savannah Morning
News of Sunday, November 21,
1909, where the Committee of In
vestigation will .make a report on
December 20th of the Asylum, I can
see where it ■will be a whitewash in
vestigation.
Now, the people are disgusted.
They will combine sometime and
clean the institution out from dome
of roof to foundation and throw out
the political clique that deals un
justly, and hides fraud and decep
tion. I have evidence to convict
that truth is lacking by some of the
physicians at the Asylum.
Mr. Editor, I do not wish to in
trude on your good nature and pa
tience, or disturb the minds of the
readers of your valuable, indepen
dent paper, The Jeffersonian. I am
prompted in writing you this so that
the people of Georgia will know the
true condition of Asylum, Ga. I
have never misrepresented anything:
the Institution itself has my good
will, but I desire to see its inmates
better fed, and many improvements
made which are lacking. A most
needed improvement is the screen
ing of dining-room windows. The
flies swarm in and take possession
of the bread hours before the pa
tients are called to meals —this
bread is cut several hours in ad
vance. The employees are treated
quite differently.
Another matter of much impor
tance to health is the beds. I slept
for over three years on a mattress
that several men had died on. It
was very soiled, bed-ticking all
gone. ’ The blankets have a terrible
odor, having been used for years
without washing. Is this sanitary?
Did Dr. W. F. Brunner know this
state of affairs existed when he was
Trustee of Asylum?
Three years ago, a Legislative
Committee was appointed to look
into the Asylum affairs. James K.
Hines, of Milledgeville, Ga., was its
Chairman. I had asked permission
to speak a few words. I stated that
I was unnecessarily held, and was
going to tell some of the hardships
I was enduring, briefly, when one of
the State’s doctors called me down.
1 tried to procure the Committee’s
misent, but failed in so doing.
They are wise old heads, ingrafted
into the Asylum tree, —which needs
1 runing badly.
Tn the investigation of September
2d two employees, a man and a wom
an, gave testimony that they knew
nothing of the abuses. It’s natural
they couldn’t hold their jobs and ad
t the truth.
I will always approve of your pa
per and your devotion to giving
space where it is necessary that
abuses should be known by the peo
ple.
