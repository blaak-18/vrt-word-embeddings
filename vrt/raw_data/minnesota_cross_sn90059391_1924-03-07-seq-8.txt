(Special Correspondence)
SIOUX FALLS, s. D., March I.—There is no mistaking the fact
in this city today that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are here.
Thursday night the organization made its pre#nce known in
no uncertain way. Bombs and star shells were exploded in the
air, and fiery crosses were set ablaze simultaneously in all parts of
the city.
It was not until after 10 o clock
that the community was startled by
the first bomb, followed by many
others, and divers star shells.
A cross was soon seen burning on
the North Minnesota avenue hill and
another at Minnesota avenue and
Fourth street. Near the East Side
cemetery another symbol of the hlan
was discovered by startled residents
and in the southeast section of the
city, near Cherry Rock bridge, a
fourth cross was flaming.
Local newspaper offices, police and
fire departments received many tele
phone calls from startled citizens
asking, “What was the explosion?
Later it was learned that the explo
sions were only the announcement of
the burning of the crosses which
were later seen in all sections.
The press here, as in other places
where the Klan has started, attacks
the organization, endeavoring to
paint a picture of it as a lawless
band of outlaws.

Falls Press asks a question in a front
Eage editorial: “Progress versus the
lan,” it is quoted in full here:
“Time was in South Dakota when
people were ahead of the organized
government, notably in Deadwood,
and it was necessary to preserve or
der and administer justice without
the assistance of the law.
“Fortunately, indeed, that time has
passed. There may be instances in
which public officials do not do their
duty. They may not whole-heartedly
enforce the law. Such officials vio
late the oath they took when they be
came officers of the law. There is ut
terly no defense for such actions.
“Neither is there defense for turn
ing the iob of enforcing the law oyer
to the Klan or any other organiza
tion, even those whose members bare
their faces to the light and stand up
to be counted. The old saying that
‘two wrongs do not make a right,’
is entirely logical.
“W’e will have come to a sorry pass
in this state when it becomes nec
essary to have our laws enforced by
those who deny the accused a fair
hearing in an open court.
“Is not that exactly what the Ku
Klux Klan does?”
Undoubtedly the editor seeks an
answer to his question. It can best
be answered by asking a few ques
tions of him. Does he know of any

proven instance where the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan took the law
into their own hands? Does he hon
estly believe that the Klan sets it
self up as a judge, jury and execu
tioner And has he any evidence of
a case in which the organization did
such?
It will not be long before the peo
ple of Sioux Falls learn that the
Klan is a law-abiding body of Prot
estant American gentlemen, and the
editor will have a difficult time in
making such assertions as are quot
ed above, and having any credence
placed in them.
There are large standing rewards
from Klan headquarters for the
proof of any instance in which the
name of the Klan has been used in
vain, to commit lawless acts or in
any way intimidate individuals. The
editor of The Press should endeavor
to collect them, for he seems to
speak with authority. Or is he in
spired by the same un-American ele
ments that have maliciously lied
about the Klan in other parts of the
United States?

WASHINGTON. D. C., Feb. 28.
The report reaching the navy de
partment a few days ago that naval
officers and enlisted men in unform
participated in a Klan ceremony re
cently near Fall River, Mass., result
ed in the secretary of the navy de
scribing the attitude of the nav>
toward secret societies or religious
organizations. Asked if the navy re
gulations prohibited naval personnel
from joining the Klan, Secretary
Denby said that the navy never in
quired into religious or fraternal af
filiations of its members. The navy
department did not think a ruling
was necessary at this time.

Bcaned on the Coco
Did you ever hear about a fellow
getting beaned on the coco? That is
what happened to A. V. Coco, attor
ney general of Louisiana, in a recent
election. He was snowed under fur
iously in the recent primary election
in that state and will be succeeded
in May by Percy Saint, of New Or
leans.
Mr. Coco comes out now and says
he will make no further move in
the prosecution of misdemeanor and
felony cases at Bastrop, La., growing
out of the operations of hooded and
masked bands in Morehouse County
parish in 1922. Further steps. Coco
said, will be up to the new prosecu

Cheers and Hisses
Think of people hissing in a legis
lative body when a measure is voted
through to have the Bible read in
the public schools of that state. That
is precisely what happened, accord
ing to dispatches, when a Bible read
ing measure was put through the
legislature of New Jersey the other
day. The measure went through
amid both cheering and hissing. The
100 per cent Americans did the
cheering and it isn’t hard to guess
who did the hissing.
The writer heard Senator Ollie
James, now deceased, of Kentucky,
say in the Baltimore national Demo
cratic convention the first nomin
ated Woodrow Wilson for the presi
dency that only geese hissed. That
remark was made publicly by James
who was presiding at the time and
William Jennings Bryan was trying
to make a speech, when he was be
ing hissed by delegates who did not
like him.

May Lose Delegation
Senator Oscar Underwood invaded
Mississippi recently in his quest for
support for the Democratic nomina
tion for the presidency. When he
spoke before the Mississippi legisla
ture three notes were sent to him at
the speaker’s stand juat prior to his
presentation to that body. The notes
asked him to express himself on the
Ku Klux Klan and he did so by ex-
Bressing emphatic disapproval of the
lan.
His remarks gave the audience of
lawmakers something akin to an
electric shock. Opinion was sharply
divided among the legislators as to
the effect of the Underwood utter
ances. It was thought likely that
his speech would prevent him from
capturing the Mississippi delegation
to the Democratic convention.

Muscle Shoals Next Week
The way was cleared yesterday for
house action next week on the Mus
cle Shoals question by the decision
of Republican leaders to take up the
McKerzie bill authorizing accep
tance of Henry Ford’s bid, it being
predicted that the house will get
through with the tax reduction bill
this week.
Final decision as to what priority
should be given Muscle Shoals had
been left by Republican organiza
tion leaders in the hands of Chair
man Medden of the house appropria
tion committee who is in favor ol
accepting the Ford bid, but who at
the same time has been pressing for
speedy action by the house on sup
ply biUs. Mr. Madden has now come
out an dannounced that the Muscle
Shoals measure shall be on the pro
gram for next week.
Immigration was scheduled to come
up immediately after the Muscle
Shoals matter was disposed of in the
house, but now it is predicted that
the bonus bill will come in ahead of
immigration. Then there will be
other measures come along pressing
for attention, so it behooves all mem
bers of the Klan to begin telegraph
ing and writing letters to members
of the house asking for early con
sideration of the immigration bill if
they are interested in seeing it get
through this session.

Immigration Fight
The senate immigration commit
tee today took several votes on the
immigration bill as it is pending in
that committee. First, the commit
tee voted to substitute as a basis of
operation, of the three per cent law
to two per cent.
The committee next voted down
the 1890 census as a basis of foreign
population and substituted the 1910
census instead. This was done by a
vote of 7 to 4 in the committee. Vig
orous opposition to adoption of the
1890 census standard, which is pro
vided in the bill now before the
House, was expressed by Senator
Colt, of Rhode Island, chairman of
the senate committee.
A motion to suspend immigration
for a period of five years was lost
by a vote of 2 to 8.
A motion to change the naturaliza
tion basis was lost 4 to 7.
A subcommittee consisting of Sen
ators Reed, Colt, King and Copeland
were appointed to draft other amend
ments to be presented to the full
committee before the senate bill is
reported to the senate.

Probable Tax Compromise
Progressive forces in the house are
about ready to switch and have about
agreed to join the administration
leaders in a compromise to mske the
tax bill a “Republican” measure, if
their demands for normal income
tax rates are met.
It is reported that a conference of
the entire Progressive bloc, it was
agreed to support the Longworth
compromise or 37H per cent as the
maximum surtax rates, if the or
ganisation leaders will yield to a 5
per cent normal rate on income be
tween 84,000 and 88.000 instead of
6 per cent as Longworth proposes.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March
I.—lt will probably be interest
ing to every Klansman in the
United States to know that the
men at the head of the organiza
tion are intensely interested in
the passage of the restrictive im
migration bill, such as has been
outlined by the house committee
on immigration.
Any restrictive immigration bill
will always have a hard fight on its
hands when it comes* to passage and
enactment into law. All the foreign
element in this country is fighting
hard to keep such a law from being
J laced on the statute books. The
ews, the Catholics, the Italians, in
fact all foreigners are against it, and
they are moving heaven and earth
to try to defeat it.
Americans Should Write
Why not, then, let the 100 per cent
Americans get together on the side
of restrictive immigration and help
put it through this session of con
gress by letting your United States
senator, member of the house know
just how you feel about it and
where you stand. Write them toduv.
Right now.
Twenty out of the 22 New York
congressmen are fighting the bill
Why? Look at their names and read
between the lines and you will get
the answer. Don’t forget who thesr
New York congressmen represent
You don’t belong in that class, there

rights and for your country.
The foreigners and the aliens are
trying to scare the Republican lead
ers of congress into believing that a
presidential year is inopportune for
enacting a highly restrictive immi
gration law. The Italians even went
to the White House when here; they
passed a resolution endorsing Presi
dent Coolidge for nomination and
election; and then they turned right
around and passed another resolution
demanding that the immigration bill
be killed. That’s politics. Play the
game yourself on the other side.
Republican congressmen from for
eign centers have even warned Ma
jority Leader Longworth, Speaker
Gillett and others that passage of the
restrictive immigration bill means
political defeat this year. Tell your
congressman on the other side what
you think of it. Then let him ehoo'e

ment. See which side he will fear

Every Klan newspaper in this coun
try should aid in this fight. Now is
the time to fight. Specific and ade
quate warning should be issued
through every agency the Klan has.
Every organization should be bulle
tined. Let’s fight the enemies of
immigration and of America who are
endeavoring to thwart the immigra
tion program. Come on. You are
now dared to tight.

LOGAN, IA, March 3. —Oblivion

The local unit of the Knights of

An enthusiastic meeting was held
the past week when many of the

with the organization. Things have

WASHINGTON, D. C„ March I.
'udging from all the writer has seen
md heard in the senate lately and
from the sort of evidence that has
been dug up by the oil investigating
ommittee, it begins to look as
hough the Democrats in the senate
ire going to make all the campaign
material they can out of the dis
losure that Ed McLean, publisher of
he Washington Post and Cincinnati
Knquirer, has had a special leased
wire running into the White House

Lean has been employing the same
telegraph operator on the Washing
ton end of this wire that operates for
the White House.
AH of this evidence is hooked up
with McLean and his close connec

charging that the oil interests even
had a private wire running right into

EX-GOVERNOR TO TALK
AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL
Henry J. Allen, Alleged to Be
Mason, Being Used as
Smoke Screen
WICHITA, KAN., March 3. — Henry
J. Allen, former governor of Kansas,
editor of the Wichita Beacon and al
leged to be a Mason, is on the pro
gram as the principal speaker at a
banquet to be held March 9 following
the dedication of St. Mary’s parochi
al school at Pittsburg, Kan.
Catholics of the Pittsburg commun
ity, it is reported, are jubilant over
the dedication, believing it will be
one of the red letter days for Ca
tholicism in southeastern Kansas.
They are also of the opinion that the
appearance of a so-called Mason on
the program may serve as a smoke
screen to deceive a few Protestants
who still think Rome is not opposed
to the American public school sys
tem.
It was during his last term as gov
ernor that Allen instructed Attorney
General Hopkins to institute ouster
proceedings against the Klan in Kan
sas. This was done, but for some
reason the Klan is still here. Now
that Allen is retired to private life
and immediate supervision of his
newspaper, he seldom misses an op
portunity to misrepresent the Klan
in its columns.

gating committee is going to put Mr.
McLean on % the witness stand, and it
looks as if'he is getting into a tight
place. One senator yesterday insin
uated that he was not so sure but*
that McLean might be indicted for
perjury in the Fall case.
Democrats are charging that Mc-
Lean has been a party trying to help
Fall out of a close place and that he
tried to do so by concocting that
SIOO,OOO loan story so Fall could tell
the story he did and thereby hide
and conceal the real man behind the
scenes who actually did loan Mr. Fall
the money.
Didn’t Have Money
It has been proved by testimony of
Washington bankers that did
not have sufficient money in banks
here to have covered his two checks
totaling SIOO,OOO had Mr. Fall seen
fit to cash same. The checks were
never cashed and were later returned
to McLean. People now profess to see
in that transaction deception and re
fer to it as a smoke screen thrown
out to blind and hide Mr. Doheny,
who really did loan Fall the money.
It begins to look to the average
man as though McLean was getting 1
himself into a tight place, and it i*
going to take some tall squirming
on his part to wriggle out without
conviction himself before the Ameri
can people of deception and possibly
perjury.
