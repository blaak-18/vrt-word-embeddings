The Negro Question.
We presunle it hardly necessari ,
to elaborate extensively aipo'll ' 1

Somne men, and they are not ge- tiln o
eral thinkers, class us as ;l'ouri o
ions"-without know\ing what ee
that term lleans; others, and t'n
they .aree dm1ag(ogue , charge sll ose
with being, "erratic" and ..preplt inth e
liced"-they do it for a pur- itert
posc, the lpurposeo of per:'oal pre- rl 1 N1
ferment or personal gain. W
Leading thinkers, and we beg th
Sdislaim 1gotismn in classing the 1
onl'selt' as a thinker, are ponder
illg,; over the grleat problem which ftro
now ellects our countryI ,r; i . ll si
which, unless speedily settled, fraion
will result in the destruction of tlle not
autonom.ty of our society, antl in
the debaselllent of our m rals Ire- 1ý r
vond the hope of a cure. the 1
Maan ini all ages has shown hinl tll
:1llf a creature of passion, ni ll
f-xhibits a sp5ctacle of a11 (xtl'eme l
in virtue or vice, : lýt " s. T'le ern all I
of '61-'71;, was one0 of thos(e lted
spasmodic deluges of thnutical i
le1i.islatiou which is marked in his. not,
tory by the wreck of mole gov- ,mn
ernuients than one. In filact, but We
few have ever recovered when aw
once submerged by that awful sea xa,
of passion, which drowned reason le i
and honor in this country during til,
the last fifteen years. Happily F,,I
for mankind, the virtue of Ameri- zati
ca is adamant, and has withstood, ov
not 'without personal as well as the
constitutional sacratices, thderude lpi
shock of the billows of tanaticisn can
ndtl communlleisll, and to-day her be
people find themselves face to stal
face with the same cluestonll which pi
seemed to unseat reason, and didl def
so ill a neasure, tell earl's since. t
We hear of menll, who every~ day thi
hopelessly imagine that "peace Ite
has coine"--that the "great ques- ,,,
tion'-tho political and social las
stauding of the inferior race ill to
the United States, has been solved, isl
when the fact exists, that the da
question has just preseinted itself
to the real thinking mind of the ,
t osesutpposed rights o' tt- '
kind upon which the delmagogue Ith
played so successfilly in the past.
The negro, to our mind, does th
not now, nor did lie ever p)osses, rii
in his brain or bosom the hidden c:
spiing of "man's capabilities to "I
govern man ;" nor do we believe is
him a person of total depravity,
but looking at thile question in the 1
light of cold, stern justice to civili
zation we are pained to say that it
the negro as a mass, 11has shown rI
himself tihe true son of his race. i i
Iornl of parents by nature inferior
ill everyc respect to all of God's r
sotl-creatiolns, he has, when elohth- I
'ed with power, striven with all i
that Ipower to 11pull down the civili. i
zatipou of the i mighty Caucasian to
;l level with the degrading barba
risl of his owit anicestry. Their
best educated are but imlitators,
while thleir snllpremaly in thle South
tor tenll years past, will nlark all
• l'a in history the success of which j
'would have been horrible to conl- c
temlplate.
Meeting this negro question, af
ter teit years abstrdet fauatical
iwarfireo, facee to face, allnd mleetilln g it
this' time to solve it finally a'ld
f'ore'ver, we Imust assumeln tile 1f11I
datuental proposition, which has
been mude a fixed one by recent
events, that it is impossible to unitce
ftr ,race.in human gorernment. In
other words,- no two races stand
ilg at extrelUes on the scalei
of eivilizatiom, as the Caucasian
and African races do, can ever be
successfully clothed with the same
civil and political power w'itlhinl
the same governmenlt. One race
or the other must comlpletely dolm
inate or else the struggle goes on.
'This is the question, the solu
tion of which weighs down tile
min14 of our best thinkers, and
tills with apprelhesiou the most
patriotic and enlightened citizen.
\What cause lies at the bottom
ot thorae bloody rice riots that
have shocked society in the South
during the past ten years t Noth
:ng more nor less than the throes
of that unenlighteeed class of the
mlighty Caucasian race, who seeo in
stinctively their dangerx, alnd
' appeal to the last resort-the only
.esort their education fits theml
f.'r discerning, brute force, in order
to save themselves from oblitera
ionu. D)emagogues may rant and
