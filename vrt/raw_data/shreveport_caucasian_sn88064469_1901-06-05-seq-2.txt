MEASURING WASTE STEAM.
An Interesting Device For Testing
the Eelieney of Pipe Coverings.
The plump, white coverings of stamin
pipes are fan-iliar to all wlo frequent
modern city dwellings, and it is gener
ally understood that they serve as a
protection against fire. That they have
a direct economic value which has been
calculated to the exact amount in dol
lars and cents may not be so commonly
known, but is nevertheless the interest
ing fact. This economy contiS from
the fact that the packing is as nearly
as post ible heat proof as well as tire
proof and, preventing as it does radia
tion from the pipes, preserves for its
intended uses the potentiality of the
steam which passes through them. For
exatmple, a specified amount of lo at
may he transferred through covered
pipes by the use of less steam and con
sequently less coal than could be car
ried through uncovered pipes.
A scientific basis for these calcula
tions was obtained in the physics lab
oratory of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology by means of an original
device constructed under the direction
of Professor C. L. Norton. A piece of
steam pipe is filled with oil and heated
from the Inside by means of electricity.
The amount of electrical energy sup
plied is measured, and hence the
amount of heat furnished Is known, as
well as the amount given out or lost.
In order to increase the accuracy of
the tests, which often lasted for days
and even for months, the oil which
serves as a distributer of the electrical
heat is briskly stirred by machinery.
and the whole apparatus Is suspended
by nonconducting cords from the cen
ter of the laboratory.
It has been found that a suitable cov
ering will save 85 per cent of the heat
which would be lost from the bare pipe
and that the consequent saving of coal
is sufficient to pay the cost of the cov
ering in less than a year.
The ability of a pipe cover to with
stand the action of heat for a prolong
ed period without being destroyed or
rendered less efficient is of vital ia
portance. For determinations of this
character it has been necessary to keep
some of these coverings for two years
