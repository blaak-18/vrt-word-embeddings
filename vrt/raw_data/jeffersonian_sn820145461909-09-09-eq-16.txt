tector as hypocrite or saint.
The theory was that all slavery
was wrong, a violation of inalienable
rights; that it must necessarily op
press and maltreat the slave, and also
it must brutalize the master and
make him cruel; therefore Southern
slavery must be a system of cruel op
pression, and that any facts to the
contrary were only exceptional. So
the system was denounced as “the
sum of all villainies,’’ and conscience
was invoked and cultivated to destroy
it. The abolitionist gloried in the
war of emancipation as a righteous
war. The true Southerners looked
upon it as an unrighteous attack up
on a social order which was forced
on them largely by the Puritan and
whose overthrow would bring dire
consequences.
We are told that our Civil War was
the result of ignorance of each other
in the two sections of' our country.
But there was no chance to relieve the
ignorance when prejudice so intense
and inveterate was cultivated in the
North by pulpit and press—a preju
dice which was founded on conscien
tious devotion to a theory and which
refused to believe anything contrary
to the theory. The abolitionist
thought he was doing “God’s service’’
by his crusade against an institution
which he regarded as the “sum of all
villainies.’’ And so he demanded “an
anti-slavery constitution, an anti-sla
very Bible, and an anti-slavery God.”
It was not the first time that con
science has trampled on justice in
the name of religion.
The war was bound to come. The
abolitionist won the victory. Today
he boasts of the achievement as a
glorious triumph of righteousness.
No Southern man would restore the
institution of slavery. But the end
is not yet. We are confronted by the
most difficult problem that ever a na
tion had to solve. Can the relations,
social, political, economic, of two
races as widely differing as Caucasian
and negro living under the same gov
ernment be so adjusted as to give
justice and proper development to
both races? Thus far we have had
only an experiment. It remains to
be seen whether emancipation has
been a blessing to our country, and
especially to the negro, or has intro
duced evils that in the end will be
more terrible than slavery.—Rev.

PECAN PLANTING.
The Bay View Pecan Nursery, of
Ocean Springs, Miss., gets out a
pamphlet containing descriptions of
select paper shell pecans, with some
excellent advice to pecan tree plant
ers. This well-known nursery makes
a specialty of a new pecan named
“Success,” which is one of the best
of the large pecans, going about 42
to the pound. Mr. Forkert, the pro
prietor, states as a fact that 17 trees,
which can be planted on an acre of
ground, while other crops are raised
between them, will, in ten years’
time, produce 40 pounds of nuts to
the tree, which can be sold for at
least $lO, thus netting $l7O per acre.
This is a low estimate, he says, and
all the while you can use the ground
for other crops.

School teachers throughout the Uni
