No. 1304
Resolved Ist, That we demand of
our State President, J. L. Lee, and
our National President, C. S. Barrett,
an early and thorough investigation
of the charges brought against Duck
worth, Ladson and Bodenhamer by
The Jeffersonian, Dallas News, Hous
ton Post, and Graphic Democrat.
Resolved 2d, That we consider the
Merchant Marine League, or the
Ship Subsidy, and the Pearre bill to
be antagonistic, unfair and unjust
to the agricultural classes of the
South; therefore, we demand the im
mediate resignation of any Farmers’
Union official who favors the same.
Resolved 3d, That we recognize
no paper as official organ of the
Farmers’ Union a majority of whose
stock is owned by other than actual
members of the Farmers’ Union.
Resolved 4th, That we are unal
terably opposed to any entangling al
liance with any labor union whose
interests are not strictly agricul
tural.
Resolved sth, That we consider
the defiance of law and the order of
courts, by individuals or corpora
tions, to be a dangerous precedent;
therefore, we demand the immediate
resignation of any Farmers’ Union
official who advocates the same.
Resolved 6th, That we consider
the establishing of a centralized
bank and the destruction of the out
standing Treasury notes to be inimi
cal to the interests of the agricul
tural classes of the South; there
fore, we demand our honorable
Representatives, Senators and Con
gressmen to use all their influence
and energies to prevent either, and
to champion the issuance of Treasury
notes bearing a low rate of interest
to be issued by the Government di
rect to the people without the inter
ference of national banks, and in
sufficient volume to do the business
of the country on cash basis, and
to maintain staple prices of the prod
ucts of the American people.
Resolved 7th, That a copy of these
resolutions be sent to Union News
and to The Jeffersonian for publica
tion.

be detrimental to the interest, pros
perity and growth of the Farmers’
Union in Georgia; and whereas, no
steps have been taken by the State
officials of the Union to investigate
these charges; therefore, be it
Resolved Ist, by the Coffee County

Farmers’ Union with other labor or
ganizations—in sending of delegates
from the Farmers’ Union to other
labor conventions, particularly be
yond the bounds of our own country.

of said delegates at midnight ses

Resolutions Passed by Turkey
Creek Local Union No. 157,
Dec. 11,1909
Whereas, an Act of Congress sub
sidizing a Merchant Marine would be
class legislation of the rankest kind,
taxing the many for the benefit of
the few; therefore,
Resolved, That we are opposed to
a Ship Subsidy.
2d. And whereas, the national
bankers are determined to destroy
the paper money called greenbacks,
and to have the Government retire

of the currency of the country; there
fore,
Resolved, That we are unanimous
ly opposed to contraction of the cur
rency in either way mentioned, or in
any other way.

An Open Letter to Mr. C. S.
Barrett by a Screven County
Farmers’ Union Boy
Dear Sir: —1. Why don’t you, as
our National President, renovate our
National affairs. They are very foul;
that you are aware of. You have
been urged to see to it.
2. We demand that you commence
that part of your duty at once, ap
point a committee of as good, honest,
reliable men as can be had of our
Order. Let this body of Union broth
ers examine the books and corre
spondence of the Union.
3. We demand that this commit
tee meet outside of Union City,
either at Macon or Atlanta. Let this
body summon to appear before it
those four men, Duckworth, Col.
Ladson and Bodenhamer (and crown
him Lord of all) and don’t forget to
have John Lee before the open
house.
4. We demand that you retain the
service of such men as have been re
ferred to in The Jeffersonian, viz.:
Rev. S. J. Cowan, Hon. F. D. Wim
berly, J. J. Brown, C. E. McGregor,
and McDaniel, of Rockdale.
5. We demand of you to retain the
legal service from an attorney that
has behind him a clean record and a
character that is above reproach.
6. We demand of you to investi
gate this matter through and
through, from center to circumfer
ence, and hew to the line.
As a few parting remarks, I will
say that if Ladson had the authority
to assure Samuel Gompers that the
Farmers’ Union was with him, why
Lon Livingston had the same right
to go over to Tammany and sell all
of us Alliancemen at 25 cents a head.
Where did the Farmers’ Alliance go
shortly after that deal? The Al
liance boys remember well where,
and the Farmers’ Union boys will
soon be in the same channel if our
National President doesn’t lasso those
grand rascals, and lead them back
in the front ranks, and let them de
fend themselves in the open. We
demand it of them, and if they can’t
come out in the open, and close up
matters, why the Farmers’ Union
boys will stamp them as traitors to
the cause.

An Open Letter to Mr. Duck
worth
Dear Sir: —Don’t you think it is
best for our organization for you to
come out in the open and answer
those questions that the Honorable
Thomas E. Watson has put to you?
Let the public know all about them,
Duck. We will not be satisfied in
this neck of the woods until you do
it. We are not satisfied with those
explanations behind closed doors.
We want you to come out in the open,
and you and Mr. Watson have a regu
lar paper controversy. We farmers
are supporting your paper, are we
not? We would like for you to de
vote some space to this matter. We
are getting impatient up here about
those questions.
Now, Mr. Duckworth, here are the
facts concerning this matter: If you
are guilty of those charges that Mr.
Watson makes against you, and
others, namely, Ladson, Bodenhamer,
and last, but not least, J. L. Lee, we
don’t need you in our business. Boys,
come out in the open and let us see
your faces. How are we to know that
you are not black sheep if you don’t
show your colors? Explain to us how
Bodenhamer got into our Order. You
all ought to know that to leave these
charges unanswered is detrimental to
our cause. The outsiders are not
going to join us. They are already
saying that our Order is a gone
cause, —just like the Alliance, and
many members are talking of quit
ting. If things are not put in better
shape, we are bound to lose ground.
You fellows seem to be very un
easy about us getting into politics.
You want to run that part of the
business, I guess, but you can not
land us into the Republican camp.
Mr. Watson charges you with advo
cating a Republican measure. It is
up to you to prove that you are not.
No, you need not worry about us go
ing into politics in our Order, but we
are thinking some about them. We
are also watching some, and think
ing a good deal, and organizing Jef
fersonian clubs to beat the band.
Yours truly,
P. D. HARRIS.

Duckworth Foreign Missions
Dear Friend and Comrade: —I am
truly glad that you are turning the
light on the Duckworth unionism. I
have had my eye on some of the Un
ion City leaders for some time. But
we don’t keep our money together
now. I used to take the Union News.
I don’t get it now. You ask, why?
Long before the Legislature met in
the summer Mr. Duckworth advo
cated an Act to create a farm super
visor in each county to go around
and teach us poor benighted clod
hoppers how to farm, and, of course,
he would have to be paid by the
farmers. And I wrote a letter to the
Union News opposing his scheme,
which he published. My letter was
endorsed and commented on by Un
ion men Jn different parts of the
State. Mr. Duckworth replied, still
advocating his plan. I replied again
in more earnest terms. Which re
ply, sad to say, never found its way
