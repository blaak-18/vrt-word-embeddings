Coavealecee vs. Religleo -
In the New Orleans Democrat of ti
lay 7thi, I Alnd an article that the is
Jeo ish temple Emanunel to New York, Il
lhave under consideration to open the il
temple for worship on Sunday, thougl to
oit to do away the Jewish Sabbath.
T'Jhe reasons given are: that the A
Jews are busy on Satnrday and una- ec
Isle to atttend. The reverend editor be
of that paper is in favor of lie change.
This is the etfort that some of the l
l-sform pulpitors (not .the congrega- h
tion) tried to doe for the last twenty- N
live years for their dear congrega
tions, for convenience and economy
without success. The first eonven
ience they commenced was exehang
ing pulpils with ministers of other Js
deniiminations for convenience sake of
in sickness, or to take a trip to Sara- tip
tge uand Niagara for recreation.
They have also tried to exchlange the
Sntnllday as a radical reform for con
vetielnce and economy, for their dear
(cngregairti,.ns, but witihlt success. o
Now tihe very pulpit exchangers come
to a new plan, to open the doors on S0
Sundays, for convenienee sake for the ir
very Ibussy body on Saturday. I ise.
agine I can hIear the news boys cry- de
ing: extrats! The Wall street and
5trl A'venue Jews are converted at
last, services colmmence at the Tm- ha
ple on Sunday at 10 a. in. Les is

time and season, "s described and pt
adoptedlby our Sanledrim law ex P
pounders. They did lot compose a
prayer, a benediction, or' deliver a j
lecture suitable a Sundnay Jew Sab
hath. This plan of opening Sunday
service will be indirectly breaking up
laturday and will be an acknowledg
nment of the resurection, if not in
theory but in practice, or for reasons Cl
of convenience antd economy. be

rr under the high coloring and fertile
er imagination of Judge Knapp, indue-4
e- ed the Jersey jnrymrjn to declare tlie

r except the fact of their illicit love
ºl and the absence of any blood-stains

i the astute Court chose to consider the
a most convincing evidence of her
I guilt. The flimsiness of the case for
the p'osecution and the warmth of
-e tIe Judge's plea fotr conviction hIave
* led to the belief that a new trial was
Inevitable, and so it would be in anl k

lice in New Jersey is for sale. This
is a startling assertion, but it is strict
ly true. It coats a thousand dollars
in that remarkably sharp community
to make an effort to get a new trial,
even when a prisoner's life is in peril.
A poor devil who is found guilty of a
clime in New Jersey may have the
r best possible case for a reversal of
judgment or a new trial, but he mutt

he may hang or go to jail for aughtIi
New Jersey justice cares. Mrs. Smith
and Covert Bennett may have been d
guilty of thlie murder of which they tI
have been convicted ; biut every law- .
yer knows that the character of the
r Juldge's charge and thle inconsistency
e of the verdict with the evidence en
title them to a new trial. They must
he proved to be guilty, and not only f
C suspected of guilt, before the sentence
of the law can justly be put into exe

Snot got as much money as jiustice is I

pre sentenced to death. Between
two and three hundred dollars has re
been raised, but New Jersey justice
demands a thousand. Pay up, she
says, to the unfortunate plisoners, or
hang and we-cut down. "It might be

(Foocbow HeraIkl.)
On Sunday,.the .16th of February,
a mob of'iver a Hindred persons
forcibly ehtered the Anleriean Metho.
dist Chapel at Yuncl'an, 140' miles
s'outl of, Foochow.. and violently as
saulted the Christians who hlad gaib
eied thereih for div'ine worship.. The
catechist and congregation escaped'
to the magistrate's yatnen, leaving !
the mob in possespion of the ehapel.
The,rabble in ome4iateiy set, to, work
gid destroyed the seals, tables, etc.
Previous totbis'attack the people haid'
Ieen called upon by the ge'ntry to
subscribe $100 eneash-avowe-diy to.
ward the extermination iof Chitisatli.,
ty in their distiiet. Their medues
operandi was to tear down the chapel
in the first instance and subsequently
to destroy the houses of the Chris
tians; thus forcibly driving them out
of the place. But, happily, only part I
of this programme wras carried out. I
The sufferets by the riot fled to the
magistrate's yamen, where they Wtere
kindly received and promised pro.
tection.
A few days later the magistrate I
went in person to inspedt the wrecked
chapel. li He immediately instituted I
an examination into thle whole affair,
and required the offende.rs to pay all i
expenses attending the repair of the I
chapel, to furnish medical aid to the
wounded men, and to find six months' i
security for the lives of the persons
assaulted. The man who had been I
most severely beaten was ordered to
receive $30 as compensation, but, I
witl rare disinterestedness, lie re
fIeed to receive the money, In order s
that the purity of his motives in be.
coming a Christian should dot be
doubted. By this prompt action of i
the Yuuch'un magistrate, and the i
unelfih conduct of the native Chris- I
tians, not only hias peace been res u
tored, but also a good state of feeling I
between the Christians and their
heathien neighbors secured, the latter
for once fully nnderstandieg that i
Christians must not be persecuted for I
refusing to conibutoe to idolatrous I
purposes, and also that the higher I
and nobler principles which they
claim to have adopted are entitled to
respect and legal recognition. i
