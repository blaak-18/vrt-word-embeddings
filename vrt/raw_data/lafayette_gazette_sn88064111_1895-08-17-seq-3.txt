"'It is the best patent medicine in
the world" is what Mrs. E. M.
Hatr'n, of Marquam, Oregon,
say~ "f Chamberlain's Colic, Chol

leads me to make this assertion is
the fact that dysentery in its
worst form was prevalant around
here last summer and it never took
over two or three doses of that rem
edy to affect a complete cure." For

A gentleman who has recently
visited the sixth ward reports that
the roads in that section are all that
could be desired. This is in strik
ing contrast with the roads in other
parts of the parish. The overseer
of that ward, Onezime Breaux, is
deserving of much praise for the
splendid condition of the roads
within the district assigned to his
supervision and it is unfortunate
that all the other overseers do not
follow his example and work intelli
gently and conscientiously to im
prove the public roads.
Last Saturday the sheriff sold the
poroperty belonging to the Casseo
succession. The lot situated nce: r
Mr. Doucet's residence was pur
chased by Louis Casseo, one of the
heirs, for $750, and the corner lot
facing HI. H-ohorst's store was bid
in by Mo-ton & Salles for $S575.
The bidding was very spirited and
the amount realized for the corner
lot which is 96x140 feet, shows that
notwithstanding the hard times real
estate in Lafayette has not depre
ciated. It is true that this lot is
centrally located, but it has no im
provements of any value. We un
derstand that Messrs. Mouton &
Salles intend building a modern
structure in which to carry on their
business.

The Gazette is requested to state
that M;ss Maud Boas will conduct

ples. Should she receive a reason

Boas' intention is to secure the ser

niept, which she is very an'xious to
introduce in Lafayette. In a' re
cent edition of the Iberia Enter
prise Miss Vida Martin concludes
an ar cle on the kindergarten with
the following:
In everything the children do, in
everything they have, they are led
back to the one great source, the
life-giver-God--faithful, true little
christians form our circle, and
fewer sinners will we have in the
coming generations, if each child is
alloweta the privilege of attending a
true Kindergarten. When we have
instilled these principles into our
children, we feel that we have made
the mountain of life much easier for
them to climb.
One night when Mr. Isaac Reese
was stopping with me, says M. F.
Hatch, a prominent merchant of
Quartermaster, Washington, I heard
him groaning. On going to his
room I found him suffering from
cramp colic. He was in such an
agony I feared he would die. I hast
ily gave him a dose of Chamber
lain's Colic, Cholera and l)iarrhoea
Remedy. I-He was soon relieved and
the first words he uttered were,
"what was that stuff you gave me?"
I informed him. A few,.days ago
we were talking about his attack and
he said hle was never without that
remedy now. I have used it in nmy
family for several years. I know its
worth and do not hesitate to recoi~n
mend it to nmy friends and customers.

:soIme are nuot ready to give tilp d!rink
ing shops, but in c:.ts of an cec
ti,:n, a majorityv of the voters wi'l
show that they are rca!dy to do away
with the scat of crin'e-the wh¾isky
shop. IIe says if we will turn ;ur
attention toward other things we
might do some goad. jNow, gen
tiemen, what could we do that
would be of more benefit to the
rising generation than to meniove
the temptation of the saloon ? rt is
an acknowledged fact that whisky
has caused more misery in the homes
of our country than all the wars and
floods, and why not ask for prohibi
tion. No;v. neighbor, you assert
that there is less whisky drunk in
Lafayette t; an in any other town
in the State. The fact is, I don't
know about th'at. 1-e you ever
visited Jennings where there is pro
hibition. A murder has never. been
committed in that town, and there
is no need of a town-cooler. No
whisky, see ! PaoxHItITtONt:r.
The Iberian is authority for the
statement that the Sunday law is
"faithfully observed in Lafayette
parish." Do you speak ironically,
.W\Veeks? Come over next Sunday
and see how it wo -ks. Nothing
less than a dozen Roosevelts can
enforce the Sunday law in these
diggings-;.
