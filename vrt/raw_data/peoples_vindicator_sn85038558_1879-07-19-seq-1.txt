THE CENUINE
D. C. XoLANE'S
CELEBRATED
LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
Ispatitis, or Liver Complaint,
I)VSPIPSIA AND SICK HIADACHI.
Symptoms of a Diasease Livr.
PAIN in the right side, under the
l edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom.
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness: the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alteriative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
h accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
,sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
w accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done., A slight,
x dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness 1
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirts are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend J
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged. 1
AGUE AND FEVER. I
DR. C. MicLANE'S LIVER PILLS, m1 E
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
I the most happy results. No better
r cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un,
equaled.

BY HARP.
From the Columbia Herald.
Away the ranks of human kind
Some go before, and some behind
But mind them well, you will afnd
Not hindmost is the Printer.
The lesons that you learn at school
That you might not grow up a fool
Had all in scientific rule
Been publisbed by the Printer.
How do your Presidents and Kings
Govern so many thousand things
1Tis Iy the types, the screws, and springs,
Belonging to the Printer.
The farmer and mechani too,
Would sometimes scarce knoie what to
do,
Could they not a certain view,
Of work doneby the Printer.
The doctors cannoet meet the erooks,
Of all the cases till he looks,
Upon the pages of the books *
Supplied him by the Printer.
The lawyer for a wit bas psed 1
But high s he his bead may et
He would be but a donee at last u
Were it not for the Printer.
Who is it that so neatly tells
The various goods the merchant sells i
Inviting all the beaux and bells, r
Who is it but the Printer. t
The classes of the human race,
Of ditlbrent uz, of different face,
Appear in this every place,
Ilow obvious to the Printer. d
One singl the bees, ene sharps and Ast
Bedecked with pantaloom s sad bats
And lose tail oeats and auseth cravats
Of th eclas is ie Printsr.
The other snlp the treble sweet, t
Adorned tth froeks and boeats teet
And look I be beastiems and e-mpol . l
And lovely to the Priters.
'Tis hymen's will of enomse ye knew,
The classes should in couplepge,
And since the world have it so,
"So be it" re tshe Printer.
1 t
There's not a men below the skies dt
Who better undmss das to pris
The charms that gre a lady's e v
Than dows this very Printer. D
Yooung malIdens th withbot debate C
Tis hoped you'll duly estlmate o
Before in fict' t is tot late, It
