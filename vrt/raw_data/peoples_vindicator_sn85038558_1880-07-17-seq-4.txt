Probably there is more done in cot.
ton future in this city than In any
other manufacturing place In Neiw
England. There is a distinction
made here In futures. For instance,
there are treasurers here who deal in
what are called "legitimate futures,"
.-. econtract which calls for a de
livery of cotton or its value equal to
the needs of the mill. . Then there
are the "gambllng futures," as some
call them here (although both kinds
come under that head), where, in
times past, treasurers and brokers
hare put up margins, have bought
fabulous qusntities of cotton, never
to be delivered, and have been win
ners or losers, as Dame Fortune
willed it. to the great joy of the form
er and the great distress of the latter,
who became ruined in character
through their misfortunes, on ac
count of using money not their own.
Some of the treasurers have made
sealleat bargaine by dealing in fu
tures of the former class, It is well
known that, when the receipts of cot. -
ton are the largest, generally in the
fall, prices are the lowest. Now,
the are wide-awake treasurers here
who take advantage of the prices
d', buy as much cotton as their
mille need, to be delivered at certain
times for specified prices.
The treasurers do put want to have
a large lot of new cotton delivered
forltshrlmks, but, by the "future"
plan, they can have It delivered as It
s wised. If the market goes down,
of course they lose, but It has often
happened here that, when delivery
time sme, the treasurer really g
odreturs for hisb investment. Le
bought aetual cotton of 'a certain
grade, sd oftentimed he has been
able to sell out his futures at an ad
vance buy a lower grade of cotton,
and hit upon a regu Iar bonana.
The cotton which comes in first Is
bet ad it is on the basis price of
this good cotton that the treasurer
works, and, as Niad above, he can
take this cotton or take an Inferior
grade, orsell out. There have been
made hfro $40,000 to $50,009 a year
by some shrewd, far-sighted treasu
rers, who only handled 6 000 bales.
Perhape itus well to add that the
Plter of the- cotton Med here
Smt amt the South and delivered
d erse by way of rail mostly,
althongh quite laýe amount from
NewArlean is shipped by vessel.
Tbhiyear more cotton has been ship
ped fIt the latter place than fromo
places in Texas, owiog to better
cfottont. Frodm advices re
l wo Teuas, it is propalple that
the quality of cotton will be better
there thl year. In speaking further
of futures, there are those who buy
contracts in New ork, sell them out
when the time cmese, and with the
proceeds pafor the cotton ordered
at the 8 h, ofttflmes making good
