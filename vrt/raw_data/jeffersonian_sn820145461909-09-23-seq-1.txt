Public Opinion Throughout the Union
COMES QUITE LATE.
And Elsie Sigel was not a mission
ary! Well, that’s wonderful but
why postpone this denial so long?
Why not let the cat out of the wal
let sooner? Many of us have said a
great deal in private talks that we
possibly would not have said if we
had known that Elsib’s father was a
liar and that all the other state
ments to that purport were untrue.
The news of Elsie’s murder was
flashed over the world months ago,
what motive was there in keeping
the matter a secret till now? Will
the church organs explain for the
benefit of some who have before sup
ported these institutions with zeal
and with what money the bribe-tak
ing and bribe-giving lawmakers
these organizations of God have elect
ed have allowed us to get hold of?
The fact is, there is no excuse for it.
The churches and their representa
tives know that they make an un
truthful statement when they say
that Elsie Sigel was not a mission
ary. What will it profit one if he
was to deceive every living creature
on earth? In the 'wind-up God will
know. But, say some, “We will pray
off the sin.’’ Yes we might, but we
might get a’going and couldn’t stop.
Let's be honest, not only in that case,
but all cases, for we “know not the
hour,’’ etc. —The Inter-State Herald.
RIPS BARS AWAY FOR THE
WHITE SLAVE VICTIMS
Iron bars are being ripped off the
widows of disorderly houses by or
der of Chicago’s new chief of police,
to whom the Woman’s World com
mittee furnished information of the
places where white slaves were held
prisoners and where white slavery,
in its crudest form glowered its
menace to possible girl victims.
Chief Steward had an investigation
made of the facts reported by the
committee and when they were con
firmed he took prompt and vigorous
action.
That a traffic in girls, their cap
ture and sale by cadets and procur
ers to keepers of disorderly houses,
not only existed but prospered on a
great, even international scale, was
discovered a few years ago when
barred windows were found in a
house which had been used as a
brothel. It has beeii proved that
' girls who were enticed or tricked
into that place had been kept as
prisoners, as slaves to commercial
ized lust and even as drudges. They
had disappeared utterly from the
knowledge of their friends and rela
tives. Their tears and pleadings had
been in vain and no communication
with the world outside the barred
windows was permitted. Ernest A.

Bell, secretary of the Illinois Vigi
lance Association, and a member of
the committee, made that discovery
and he it was who showed Chief
Steward photographs of place after
place on Armour avenue where grim
iron bars across the windows told of
the 'white slavery within, and which
resulted in energetic official meas
ures.
Raids made by prosecutors for the
state and federal governments have
confirmed the fact that girl captives,
often daughters of excellent homes,
were held by lock and force to do the
degrading bidding of their purchas
ers and procurers. These methods
were not followed in Chicago alone,
but in other cities. The barred win
dows, however, were basis for the
new Illinois act prepared by the
Woman’s World committee against
the detention of girls in such places
by force or under pretense of debt,
a law enacted in April and now in
force. Investigations in Boston and
other cities show that similar law is
needed in nearly every state in the
union and efforts are urged to secure
both such law and its enforcement.
COL. BRYAN’S NEW DANGER.
No one sees the ancient Bryanites
tumbling over each other to get on
their leader’s latest band wagon,
which floats a standard bearing the
motto, “Return to Clevelandism.” It
can’t be possible that those who fol
io-wed him through all his kaleido
scopic changes of paramount issues
from free silver to government own
ership of railroads are going to balk
at this new declaration of principles
on his part. It does seem so, for
some of them, notwithstanding their
leader’s recent declared advocacy of
return to Clevelandism, are still
senselessly denouncing as a traitor to
his party the only man the Democrats
have been able to place in the White
House under the present alignment
of political parties. Is Clevelandism
to be the rock upon which Mr. Bry
an’s political craft it to be complete
ly wrecked after its survival of so
many storms, any one of which
would have swamped any other, and
that, too, when it is headed more
directly toward the home port of
old-time Democracy than at any time
in many years?—Birmingham Age-
Herald.
HOME MISSION WORK.
While in North Georgia recently
we saw a sight that recalled Thomas
E. Watson’s crusade for home mis
sionary work.
A mountaineer family consisting
of a mother and seven children were
walking along the road. The oldest
boy seemed scarcely more than 12
years of age. The mother carried a
baby and so did one of the other
children. They were all sallow, un
dersized and poorly dressed, evi
dently ignorant mountain folk. Liv
ing in one of the most healthful sec
tions in the United States, their color
was as bad as that of people living
in the malarial sections of Florida.
Unsanitary conditions and scant and
unwholesome food had left their
mark.
Later we discovered that this fami
ly were on their way to the barbecue
given by Dr. W. C. Bryant to the
Weekly Press Association. They
probably trudged several miles in or
der to get a square meal, and we are
glad to be able to report that they
made good use of the opportunity.
There are many people in the
mountain section of Georgia who are
densely ignorant. Isolated and clan
nish, they will pursue their monoton
ous, narrow life if left alone. They
need intelligent women to go among
them and teach them cooking and
cleanliness. They need to have their
ambitions aroused, so that they will
send their children to schools and
Sunday schools.
When we reflect upon the mission
ary field in Georgia, not only in the
mountains, but in sections of Middle
Georgia and South Georgia as well,
we believe that Watson is doing a
work in contending that it is
not the part of judgment to overlook
those of your own flesh and blood
right at our doors and throw' a halo
around mission work in China; that
it were more consistent to furnish
schools for our own illiterates and
give them a chance than to conduct
schools with free tuition and free
board in China, where schools are
plentiful.
The experience at Young Harris,
Walesca, Miss Berry’s School, Demo
rest, and other schools, prove that
these mountaineers make sterling
men and women when educated. The
mission work in China has cost mil
lions of dollars. A small proportion
of this amount given to deserving in
stitutions and good men and women
in Georgia would produce more satis
factory results, in our opinion.—
Cuthbert Leader.
THE BREAD WINNER HAS THE
EASIER TIME.
We know full well the air of po
lite amazement or amiable incredulity
with which men receive the statement
of a woman’s opinion that in the
home partnership the wife, and not
the husband, pulls the laboring oar.
Still it is true that, let a man’s busi
ness be ever so engrossing, ever so
wearisome, ever so laborious, the
mere fact that he goes to it in the
morning and returns from it at night
sets him above his wife in ease and
comfort. For him the slavery of rou
tine has its breaks. He gets a breath
of the world outside; he has change
of scene daily; he sees people and
hears them talk; and his home is
distinctly his refuge and shelter. Let
a wife and mother love her home and
her children with the most absolute,
unswerving devotion, and serve them
with the most unselfish fidelity, there
are nevertheless times when she is
weary. She knows better than any
one else the steps and the stitches,
the same things done over, and petti
ness of the trials that come to the
nursery and kitchen. They are so in
significant that she is ashamed to
talk about them, and we fear she
sometimes forgets to tell her Savior
how hard they press her; and so,
bearing her cross all alone, its weight
becomes crushing. A sunshiny hus
band makes a merry, beautiful home,
worth working in and for. If the
man is breezy, cheery, considerate,
and sympathetic, the wife sings in
her heart over puddings and mend
ing basket, and*counts the hours till
he returns at night, and renews her
youth in the security she feels of his
approbation and admiration. —The
Dodson Times.
CONDEMNING FRUIT.
Fruit inspection, especially in the
New York market, is very rigid, says
Up-to-Date Farming. The first car
of Georgia peaches that came to that
market this season was condemned,
and not a peach of the entire carload
was allowed to be put on the market.
The cause of condemnation was
that the fruit was too green. The
haste to get it onto the market while
the market was bare and prices were
naturally high, prompted the grower,
urged by the local shippers, to gather
the fruit before it had nearly come
to maturity, and by the time it had
reached the market it was shriveled S
and entirely unfit for human food. /
While such fruit might not have
found its way to the consumers
through the better houses, it would
be taken by the street venders and
sold to school children, the very class
most likely to be injured by it. The
inspectors can not be blamed for con
demning it.
The lesson for growers and ship
pers is that they should not put on
the market anything but wholesome
stuff, and if they want the best re
turns they should put it up in the
very best condition. Do everything
as brother for brother, with the
golden rule as the basis for the ac
tion. After all, “Honesty is the best
policy.”
