And Ben Avant, the genial Ben,

Judge WV. E. Bowen left tltis week
with his family for Algiers, aftbr a
residence of several years in Lafa
yette. The people of this town
regret to part with Mr. Bowen and
his family, and wish them prosperity
wherever they may go. During a
long stay in our midst the judge has
always takien a prominent part in
all affairs of a public nature, all
the-time evincing a commendable
interest in the welfare of the com
aunity~i of which he was a conspi
cuoius. member. The Gazette adds
its own, wishes for Judge Bowen's
success.

Wedenesday morning, Mr. Au
guste Pointboeuf, one of the oldest
residents of this town, breathed his
last at l is home. Mr. Pointboeuf
was born at St. Colmobe, France,
8x. years ago, but moved to this
country wheii quite young. He
came to Lafayette 4x years ago and
during all that he was ever known
as a hardworking, honest man and
law-abiding citizen. He leaves a
widow and several children, all!
respected members of our commu
nity.
The fine display of gold and sit
ver.watches in Biossat'sshow window
is attracting the attention of all the
passers. Few are the watch dealers
in the State who handle such a large
and assorted stock. When gazing
upon this dazzling array of watches
the thought naturally arises: 4"Why
in- the world does Biossat get so
many watches ?" Because his trade
has increased so much that a small
er stock will not meet the demands
of his numerous customers. The
people know that he sells none but
the best, hence the popularity of
his goods.
Thanksgiving day was the occa
sion for a most interesting and im
pressive service at the Methodist
church conducted by the Rev. J.
M. Heard. The reverend gentle
man took his text from James, :st
chapter and x7th verse, "'Every
good gift and every perfect
gift, is from above and cometh
down from the Father of lights
whom is no variableness neither
shadow of turning." l'The church
had been beautifully decorated with
evergreens, flowers and various
fruits and vegetables such as sugar
cane, rice, corn, pumi:ins, pota
toew, etc. A large and apprccia
tive congregation, were edified by
the solean :tland patriotic dlevutions
of the day.
The-, people of Lafayette *'1ill have
an opportunity to witness a very
itYeresting and uiqtue entertain
mnent. _Jrs. C-en. Tomn Thumb and
her company of !ilputians will give
a perforimnance at Ialk's (Opera
1-ouse WVedrnesday evening. The
celebrated little lady will be driven
thronugi the stbects of the town in
her riniature carriage drawn by a
span of sc :ali Shetland ponies with
the smallest coachman ever seen in
Lafyette. Th; troupe, conmoposed
of little folks, will appear in a play
which has been enthusiastically re
ceived wherever performed.. The
performance is original and calcm
lated to entertain young and old.
The litt!e Th:iubs are said to be
stars in their profession; they act
well, have sweet, modulated voices,
in keeping with their makcrup, and
those who will fail to see them will
miss the biggest treat of the season.

prince. It is in your power to
raise both, and for that reason you
have no ground for complaint.

plant of the past. This parish is
