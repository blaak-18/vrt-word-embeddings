These salaries are over those given ft
iln Texas and Ohio, and a» large as n
those allowed in a great number of (1
our largest States.
The offices of Lt. Governor, Snu
perintendent of Public Education and s
Secretary of State, it is proposed c
should be abolished. The Senate can t
chose its own presiding oificer, while f
the Secretary of State might be re
tained, but the officer is superfluons.
Public Education in this State will
never amount to a fig until the sys
tem is thorouhlh localized. Let the
monies paid in be turned over to
p)arochlial authorities for their man
agement. The Legislators are re
duced in number to one from each
parish and District in New Orleans,
and 24 Senators should be sufficient,
when 76 does for the whole Union.
The sessions made for 30 days, andi
Biennial.
The Judges are lopped down con
siderably. The Supreme Court to be
one of law alone. All misdemeanors,
petty offences, and all crimes not
punishable by hard labor in the peni
tentiary or with deathl, to be tried
before local Magistrates, without jury,
and fines, labor on roads, and levees,
to be inflicted as punishment on of
fenders.
By this means thIe saving to our im
poverished people will amount year
ly to the enormous sum of $443,100.
Does any sane man suppose that
"amendments" will do this thorough
work, which the taxpayer demands,
and which must bre done ?
The country Press, we are glad to
see, is going to be heard in the mat
ter of taxation. That Press repre
Nents public sentiment, and will have
its influence for that reason. We
note the Onachita Telegraph, a paper
that in Editorial ability ranks second
to none in the State, utters no uncer
tain sound when it calls on Legisla
tors to beware how they try the tem
per of the people; how they, elected
and presuming to represent a constit
uency, dare act against the will of
that constituency in thie matter of
calling a Constitutional Convention.
The Opelousas Courier, Mansfield Re
porter, DeSoto Democrat, Markeville
Bulletin, Baton Rouge Adrocate,
Morehouse Clarion, Richland Beacon,
oachita Telegraplh, and .Monroe Ob
server, all ranking as first class coun
try journals; journals of tone, etand
big, and ability, have done noble ser
vice in the cause of the people, many
of them for years, and their utteran
ces are the utterances of the great
mass. of Louisianlans, woise voice
now, as at all times, had best be at
tended to.

Taxes Paid In.
This parish has shown its patriot- li
ism in responding to the support of tras
the government of the choice of the :ear
great majority of tiosejupolln whom Dem
the burdens of government fall, and for I
not« itlistanding theirr poverty have
yielded to the revenues of the State Pid
and Parish over tifty thousand dol- lt
hirs during the last six months. In I)
thiis they have done their du1ty, but So
they did so with the understanding Pay
that the hotdens they have, and do isli
now complain of, should he removed. 11
They see no ''reform" in cutting
S
down the salaries of starving clerks, Co
reducing printers' hbils to beggarly
rates, giving juirors nothing for their
1S
services, whichl thile great majority are
too ploor to render for nothing, and Cos
allowing all these "big pay" people 1
to go on enjoying the largest salaries 1
paid be any State in the Union, save
two, to their public sQrvants. Prac
tical reform nmost come with a rtehl
tion of ta.Xrttion. The 14I mills of Kel
logg stares the empoverished payer
in the facee as well to-day as it did
then and something must be done to Jai
reduce it.
Real estate must be released from
the burdens of either State or parish
taxation. One body politic or the To
other must getits revenoue from othler
sources than grinding it out of the
lands and 'tenements of the farmers
and house owners. Let the State tax sac
capital, incomes, occupations, and in- be(
troduce the Moflitt register, as a thi
means of revenue for general purpo- wi
ses. For its levee interest and sinking kin me
fiund tax, let the cotton, tice, molasses lbe
and su'gar grown and marketed from bel
levee protection bear thle burdens ; le
0 and for school purposes, a x2.50 poll tll
tax, with local aid, will create a fund lr,
much larger than that now collected. wl
1 All these measures, if adopted, would ni
leave real estate; lands, houses, stock, be
&c., subject only to local taxation,
which could be restricted within a sh
reasonable limit. Pe
It is useless however to talk of all ri
these things, orlhope for them except
by and through a new, honest and
i strong organic law. Let our legisla
3 tors look to it, that it be had. ri

10 The school archives of this parish at
are in the hands of It. C. Myers, who en
is under indictment for embezzling to
l) the school monies, and if any steps lI
hI) Iave been taken to make him surren- nc
00 der them we are not aware of it. ti
Myers, of course, has not been tried. s
00 lie is in New Orleans and has for- &
feited all the bonds under which lihe
n. was held. A man can steal the school r
en funds of a parish ; suppress and do i'
as away with the hooks of the Auditor's e'
of ofice of a State ; thwarttht, expressed "
will of a people tl-rough tihe machi- t(
. nations of a Returning Board and go P
u scot free. Let himi dare, however, to
d carry an old pistol or steal a pig ;
n then hie goes to the penitentiary or is 1
le fined, quick. ii
to We want no better evidence of the P
is utter weakness of an administration
ill than this; wherein it exhausts its
e. puny efforts in the suppresion of
he crime by sending a poor nregro to trhe
to penitentiary for stealing a hog, when
n- the State is cranmed full of public rob
re- bers who walk forth without fear.

d The Wrong Way.
a- Has it ever struck our contempo- I I
raries that our legislators and press do
as well as supposed "leading men,' ',
sh ate plrolific in suggestions to collect rer tit
ho enues ; and are propagating schemes I;
ug to force the tax payers to meet the hi
ps large demands .of the State ; while -
,. never a word is uttered by them about
it. the root of all the trouble, exces tit
,d. sive taxation, extravagant salaries, AN
nr- &C. ju
he We contend this is not the way to lii
ol relieve our people. It is, in fact, but gt
do improving upon the radical plan of "
enforcing collections. Our people are ai
willing to pay if they lhad the means 11
Sto do it; but they are entirely too )
o pioor to bear these burdens longer.
to Let something h done thoen to re
Sduce the expenses ot tihe State ; to c
is bring the payment of the taxes with
in the ability and means of thle em
he poverished citizen, and there will be
on no need for these vigorous penalty I,
its laws to force their payment. k
of Edm nd Burke, one of the greatest E
he statesman that England ever produ- o
en ced, has this to say about public faith : P
ob- "It is to the property of the citizen, h
and not to'the demands of the cteditor c
of tile stlate, that the original faith of e
. the nation is given, and the claim of T
the citizen is prior in time, paramount I
mli in title, and superior int equity."
