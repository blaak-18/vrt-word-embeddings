The Work Before Us !
The real task of redeeming Lon
isiana is only begun, and every
lover of this State must fully re
cognize this important fact. The
lpresent government which now
. exists is that of the people, the
great mass of the honest and in
telligent people, and they alone
I are expected to finish the great
work before them.
trUp to this present time, no se
rious blunder has been committed.
n and every one has shown a dispo
i sition to lend a helping hand to
our noble Governor in his arduous
duties.
As a matter of course, every
thing cannot he accomplished in a
day, the construction of great
things have ever cost years of
r time, and millions of money ; but
- still this should not discourage us,
on the contrary, .nerve us to great
s er action and renewed hope. Cor
ruption and rascality have left
their fbot-prints on our shores,
H and venality has characterized
men in exalted positions, but still
t there are yet among us a sufticient
number of good and true citizens
tocomplete the work of redeeming
this State from her torrner pros
trate condition.
SIn looking down the dim vista
of the future, though not with
r poetic prescience, yet with the eye
of holy faith, we can see Lou
n isiana as she should be, the "gar
d" en-spot" of God's creation; for
r her, nature has strown her gene
Sros gifts with a prodigal hand,
I while the science of mtan has done
but little for her.
It should be hereafter the great
thought of all honest and patriot
ic citizens to see this lovely State
with all her natural advanta
5 ges rise to that pre-eminence to
which she is justly entitled, and
which by right should be hers.
Down with rings and rascality,
have done with rancorand hatred,
and we will be free in fact, as well
s in name.

A neighboring paper intimates
strongly that the Democratic party
of this State is a party of hate and
prescription-that they have perse
cuted and ostracised men for opin
ion's sake. We welre s!hcked..teLt fwl!
1nmns of the .journal to which we al
iude, and more so when we know tile
editor should know and no doubt
does, that such is not the case.
We have never yet admitted that
Sthe local canvass in Louisiana
was a political contest. If it even
bears a semblance to suench a thling
we have failed to discover it.
What has the returning hoard,
cavalry raids, arrest of cilizens by
troops, the plunder of taxpayers and
the treasury as well as eight per cent
taxation to do with politics, we'd
like to know t Sonime men are so
constituted that they can regard a
robber as being engaged in legitimate
business and this desire to elevate
tihe hitherto plunderers ot the people
of Louisiana to the dignity of poli
tlcal opponents is no more than an
attempt to render theluves respectable.
This is tile judgment on these people,
proclaimed all over tile Union, both
from respectable Republican papers
North as well as Democratic-and
the attempt to blow up tile stinking
carcass of dead thievery in Louisiana
that Hayes himself set down on and
flattened out, -with a weak country
qnill; is as yarn and redienulous as it
is contemptable andi disgusting.
Mr. C. L. Walmsley returned from

Thanksgiving Day.
On Thursday last, (10th inst.) the
Sun rose beautifully bright to usher
in a lorely May morn, the day set
apart by Gov. Nicholls for thanks
giving to God for our deliverance
from the hands of the spoilers. Not
a cloud specked the cerulean vault
that arches the Universe, as no re
gret should dint the joy of all lovers
of free governlment.. At the hour of
ten o'clock A. 1M. the loud tones of
the bell in the Cathedral tower, an
nounced the time for the celebration
of High Mass In commenmoration of
the ascension of our blessed Savior,
as well as the trinmph of virtue over
vice, and intelligence over ignorance
and venality. As this beautiful cere
mony was being completed, the hell
of the Ptotestant Church peeled forth
t its soft tones to tell the hour that was
f to be the commencement of the
t thanksgiving ceremonies there. Rev.
Mr. lhough of the M. E. Church, spoke
eloquently of the duties of christians
to country, and for an hour interest
ed his congregation.
In the evening the Choir of the
Cathedral of the Immaculate Con
ception sang the !'e D)enm laudamus
in their very best style, and as the
t solemn and majestic hymn swelled
5 the air with its joyous notes, each
t and every heart felt its pulsations to
quicken in honor of the glorious oc
casion which called it firth.
This hymnn is simple, though one
ot the grandest in the whole range of
the hymnology of the Roman Catho
lic Church, and was first sang at the
baptism of Augustine by St. Ambrose,
and it is therefiore known as the Am
r brasian Hymn. Thus ended the day
in our city. All the principal busi
ness houses remained closed through
out tihe day, and all participated with
joyous hearts on the ever-to-be re
tmembered occasion.

Record.
It is a pity this question can not be
satisfactorily solved. Newspaper men--
' who of course know all ahsnt tfarmning---
I never weary of the suliject but it is oh -
served they seldom undertake to offer
anything better than mere dicta where
as practical farmers, who are sqippºsed to

cultivation of the crops best adapt.el to
our climate and soil. 'here are certain
propositioins about which there is no
res m for difference of opinion. Cotton,
Ssugar atnl rice are all }nit induigennims ti
the Month. They are oifr great staples
and ,tnst necessarily nmply better reinO
1 neration than anything else we can grow.
SThe cereals, anad corn in particular. are
the staples of tha West, and mbust take

cilftlYmIfli of coin at fle South is advi
sable only in so, far as it can be done
without interferiig with thie prodnction
of our in ligenions slaplvs. ('orn may
be grown at the South, but there are few
persons who will cl ima that it grows as
Swell here as at the West, or that it will
pay the planters a remnneration equal
to cotton or sugar. Our advice is, grow
ull thie cotton, sugar and rice you cat,
and if after that you can rsise any corn,
do so.---N. O. Times.
If the New Orleans Times will examine
the records of the different parishes, tIhe
numerous mortgages on the plantations
of the persons who planted "alli the cot
te, they could," and no cornt, but de
pelded on the West for it, it will be at
once counvinctced that although the Cot
ton Merchant antd the Coutnnission Honse
may, and do thrive, the farnmer is beg
gared, and the country at large is al
ways in poverty.
The Times is mistaken in tho idea, en
deavored to be inculcantd by thinking
men, into the ways and walks of the
farming commnnity. It is not to plant
corn to sell, but to grow it in order not
to buy it from the "West and North
west."
We are endeavoring to get the farmer
to make his cotton crop the profit of his
farm-not the basis of all his agricultu
ral operationls. To do that, be mnust
plant grains and grasses to feed, fatten
and rear stock for work on the farm, and
for food for himself and laborers, by
which lihe leaves his cotton, cane antd rice,
as clear profit in bulk.
Follow out the Times' idea and the
country at large would he rnined beyond
doubt. We don't know how much corn
the West produces per acre, not more
however, than 40 bushels as an arerage,
but Red River can average fifty with
perfeet ease. and we know of one farner
that averaged 74 bushels per acre.
The fact is, no one knows of, or cares
~abont the cultivation of corn in the rich
land sections of the south, simply be
cause they have the idea in their heads
that cotton is yet King to the farmer, and
it is for that matter, butt despotic and
ruioons, unless the subject raises his own
grain and meat, first-his cotton after
wards. The Timnes writes in the interest
of the cotton merchant, we in the inter
est of all, the farmer narticularly.
Dewberries (Bubus proeumbene of
N etb America) have been during the
week quFite plentifal, offering by the
basketfhl, cheap for cash. This is a
delicious frut, much soperior to the
British frauit of the same na me, and
morilact. If a ready market could
be found for this variety of fruit it
might be cultivated here with con
siderable profit.

1 - ----~.----
SA friend of ours in from the coun'
try tells us that a "radical nigger"
can't be found in the whole rural dis.
tricts. Every one you meet of the
"unwashed," is perfectly satisfied
that the "put-back-into-slavery"
doldge of the carpet bag and negro
leader durintg the campaign was a
big scare and from "die out, boss, I'se
a lie hop dimlcrat."
The school board appointed for
Ithis parishl consists of sii whites and
three colored. Mr. W. H, Jack de
clines to serve and this will be greatly
regretted. It is hoped that the 'board'
will be remodeled for eflieeney sake.
One of thie ramembers can neither read
tor write. Goe. Nicholl's "polhcy"
has about run out we think.
We learn fri',n indical sources tliant
the policy pursued by Gov. Nicholls
with regard to appolntments is like
ly to raise a war in camp. lIow tlhis
mtay be we do nut know, but we must
admit there is a growing feeling of
discoutent among the mafterial citi
zeus of this section with regard to
some of his appoittmeuts. How this
discontent will manifest itself we do
not kuowt, but we fear the worst for
hiim and our people.
The lady cleiiks of the htitaerlor de
partment now claim to bhe under
shirts.
This oice cannot afford to employ
proof readers at a distance ; those do
sirous of the position should apply
for a situation,
"Hlope tells thi, flattering tale that joy
will sooint be leOe." Yes, the iuvalide
who luse omte 1to ol:'h Bitters call rely
on tbhe hope of returning joy for them.
