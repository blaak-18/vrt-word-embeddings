believe in that kind of money. Like
Jefferson, Benton and Jackson and
the democrats generally of the old
school, I believe in government mon
ey —every dollar, gold, silver or pa
per, being created and issued by the
government. I do not believe in na
tional bank notes nor in clearing
house certificates. We were forced
to accept clearing house certificates
last year, and will, probably, have
to accept them again. Having made
us take this soap wrapper currency,
whether we wanted to or not, I feel
very much like feeding them with the
same spoon. Turn about is fair
play. They sauced our goose last
winter; let us sauce their gander
this winter. Southern men every
where will unite with us, for com
mon interest unites us all.
Fight for Principle.
1 ‘Something tnore is involved in this
struggle than mere greed for dollars.
We are not gathered at this conven
tion for the mere matter of money
making. It is a question of justice,
of principle, of sacred right, of self
preservation. In effect, it is just as
bad for us to be robbed by law as in
violation of law. To the victim there
is no substantial difference. When a
sneak thief snatches your purse, the
law brings its heavy hand down upon
the criminal; but under the same sys
tem of government the law gives to
the manufacturer and to inland com
merce the power to plunder the farm
ers of this country to the extent of
hundreds of millions of dollars per
year. What are we to say about it?
What are we to do about it? Are we
always to submit to spoliation? Are
we never to take up our arms and
make a stand for home and loved
ones? Farmers of the south, you are
industrial slaves. Rouse yourselves
and throw off the yoke. By united
effort you can regain much which has
been lost. Common interest says
unite. Patriotism says unite. Self
preservation says unite. Be lions
among lions, and not sheep among
wolves.

THUMB BELLS.
The thimble was originally called a
thumb bell by the English, because
worn on the thumb, then a thumble,
and finally its present name. It was
a Dutch invention, and was first glass
and pearl. In China beautiful carved
pearl thimbles are seen, brought to
England in 1695.
Thimbles were formerly made only
of iron and brass, but in comparative
ly late years they have been made of
gold, silver, steel, horn, ivory, and
even glass and pearl thimbles are
seen, bound with gold and with the
end of gold.
The first thimble introduced into
Siam was a bridal gift from the king
to the queen. It is shaped like a
lotus bud, made of gold, and thickly
studded with diamonds arranged to
spell the queen’s name. —Church Ec

THE COUNTRY PRESS.
An Address by Chas. S. Lewis, of
Quincy, 111.
We are today enjoying a higher
civilization, a truer religion and a
better humanity than ever before
dreamed of in our philosophy or w r rit
in our history, and nowhere do they
find more faithful expression and ex
emplification than in your own com
monwealth of Missouri. Were I asked
to name the most important factor of
the various energies which have con
tributed towards this development I
would answer, "The country press.”
I am not seeking to disparage the
large city dailies and other metropoli
tan publications, all of which are in
dicative of the growing literary taste
of your citizens, but the paper which
exercises a real moulding influence
upon the life of the community, which
is the honored visitant at the fire
side, is the local weekly with its rec
ord of personal interests and sympa
thies and tragedies.
Perhaps its influence lies in the
fact that it is the forum of the great
common people, for whenever any
agency becomes invested with this
function it has acquired the highest
prerogative of power and authority.
You remember Abraham Lincoln once
said that God Almighty must have
loved the common people, else He
wouldn’t have made so many of them,
and we have all learned to venerate
what God has done and to sanction
what Lincoln said.
I wouldn’t give much for the
American home that exiles the local
paper from its hearthstone. It is like
the poet’s description of the man
without music in his soul, "Fit only
for treason, for stratagems and
spoils.” We learn our best lessons
in patriotism from the country press,
together with those other rugged vir
tues which mark the moral robustness
of the times.
There are two influences which give
direction to every man’s career —a
mother’s hallowed instruction and
those records of boyhood days which
are mirrored in memory from the
columns of the old home paper. The
type, minion and brevier, which
printed its dear old pages has been
battered down, and the brain that
ached upon its composition has
ceased to burn, but its influence re
mains like a beacon ready still to
light pathway of maturer years.
If you want a practical test of the
peculiar charm and interest which
your home paper possesses, just note
the riot of emotions which aspire for
supremacy when you unexpectedly en
counter a copy after a prolonged ab
sence from home. It is like the sight
of your flag in a foreign land.
But, great as has been the influence
ISfye 3effersonian
of the country press, that is nothing
compared with its possibilities for
future accomplishment. Heretofore
it has worked individually. Today it
is advancing—
"As the winds come when the for
ests are vended,
As the waves come when navies are
stranded,”
prompted, however, by a common in
terpretation of duty and guided by a
common appreciation of respecta
bility. It’s the mightiest power in
our civil life today, and the indi
vidual who wantonly ignores it or
provokes it to combat will retire from
the contest with a very much bat
tered anatomy.
Under the license of these occa
sions we are all prone to indulge in
some extravagance of rhetoric. Still,
I hazard the further observation that
it is within the power of the country
press to effect any reform which it
may espouse, whether social, eco
nomic or political, and I believe the
time has come when your readers are
going to hold you to stricter account
ability in the discharge of such duty.
Finally, I have the largest faith in
the progress and uplift of our coun
try, in the final triumph of those sim
ple virtues which are essential to the
development of character and in the
vindication of the higher ideals of
citizenship. I can not think that the
expression of these views is mere
"sound and fury” or that they have
not logical connection with my theme,
for as I look into the faces of this
assemblage I behold as valiant a
force as ever dedicated a service to
the cause of humanity—the country
press.
THE MAN WHO IS ALWAYS
"JUST GOING TO.”

He was just going to help a neigh

He was just going to send some
flowers to a sick friend when it
proved too late.
He was just going to reduce his
debt when his creditors "shut down”
on him.
He was just going to stop drinking
and dissipating when health became
wrecked.
He was just going to provide proper
protection for his wife and family
when his fortune was swept away.
He was just going to introduce a
better system into his business w’hen
it went to smash.
He was just going to call on a cus
tomer to close a deal when he found
his competitor had preceded him and
secured the order.
He was just going to quit work
awhile and take a vacation when ner

He was just going to repair his
sidewalk when a neighbor fell on it
and broke a leg.
He was just going to provide his
wife with more help when she took

DIVIDE EDUCATIONAL TAX.

ing the negro. We know what educa
tion means to the negro. It unfits
him for the purpose for which he
was created, and makes a dangerous
enemy in our midst; makes forgers,
idlers, vagrants, thieves. We know
that the mutinous atmosphere, in
communities where large negro col
leges are situated, abounds with dis
cord and rebellion, a place where riots
are promulgated, and is not a safe
abode for any white family, but we
know, even if outsiders do spend for
and propagate such institutions, that
the laws of this fair free land, are
such that we can make them sell or
move or abandon them when they be
come a menace to our safety.
Let our next Legislature pass a
law to wipe out the well-known ser
vice pan, making it a misdemeanor
to carry food from homes in which
they work, thereby running the va
grant negroes from the cities and put
ting them to work in the fields, and
let us divide the tax and prepare ru
ral schools and take our little coun
try children out of the fields and edu
cate them, and the farms of Georgia
will blossom like a rose and fewer
farms will be deserted and the own
ers move to town because they can
then educate their children - and im
prove their farms too.

TOMMY AS GOOD AS A CHART.
A Boston physician tells a story of
a youngster of his own that an over
strenuous vacation had put on the sick
list. The father had an appropriate
prescription filled, and left the bottle
with the child’s mother. As she, how
ever, is very forgetful, he gave her a
chart, and suggested that she set down
the hours when the medicine should
be given, checking off each dose as
taken. Upon returning from his
evening calls, however, he found the
chart blank.
"Good gracious, Mary,” he ex
claimed, "surely you haven’t failed
to give Tom his medicine?”
"Oh, no! I did not miss a single
time,” his wife assured him.
"How in the world did you remem
ber it without the chart?” he asked.
She smiled.
"That was easy. I just told Tom
this morning at what hours he was to
have it, and half an hour before each
time he would begin hallooing that he
wouldn’t take it.”—Twentieth Cen
tury Review.
STRICTLY FRESH EGGS.
There are summer resorts, remote
from any agricultural communities,
where fresh farm products are even
harder to obtain than in the city. It
was at such a place that the new
boarder, who had eaten four or five
breakfasts there, began to wonder
why the eggs were invariably served
fried.
"See here,” he inquired one morn
ing of the genial colored man who
waited upon him, "why do you al
ways fry eggs here? Don’t you ever
boil them?”
"Oh, oh, yes, sah!” responded the
waiter pleasantly. "Os co’se yo’ kin
have ’em boildd if yo’ wants ’em, but
yo’ know’, sah, yo’ takes he risk!”—-
