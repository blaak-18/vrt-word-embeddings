THE BAT' URE LEASE.
Acting Mayor Hicks Should De
cline to Sign It.
The city ecuncil at their session
held ou Thursday, July 18, adopted
an ordinance authorizing the mayor
to sign a ten years' lease to the bit.
ture property with D T Mairiug
for a term of ten years, be
ginning at the end of the present
lease, which will terminate in about
two years.
This proposition was passed by
six votes. Yeas-Agurs, Alston,
Hughes, Jackson, Maury and Wag
ner, and against five votes-Allen,
Crain, Ford, Harkey and Johnson.
The action of the majority is air
prising and their baste cannot be ex.
plained except on tbe plea of a senti
ment or of friendly regard for the
gentleman and his attorney, who de
sire to secure a long lease at a nomi
nal figure.
As a business proposition it is
quite natural that the gentleman in
terested has a right to obtain, it he
cen, the best terms possible, nor can
his attorney be held to blame in bis
efforts in his behalf, but the city coun
cil, as a body, representing the peo
ple and only the people, should have
been governed by a policy which
business principles would suggest to
each and every one in the private
coneerns.
The Caucasian has always held that
a long lease of the public domain
and the batture prooerty is in that
sense public domain-is equivalent
to a sale.
As was well said by Couneilman
Allen, the couneil should not have
considered a eontract which will be
glit in two years, when, perhaps, not
a single man voting in favor of the
lease will be sitting as a eouneilman
And as was well said by the same
gentleman the principle is wrong
and all such leases should be ofereu
to the highestbidder, after due ad.
vertisement. We question seri'nelf
the right of the present ouneil to
make a contraet twe years in advanes
of the date or time fixed for its be.
ginning, and if toe present council
has such legal authority what is to
withhold them at their next or the
following session to extend the lease
of the Cotton Belt and all other leases
which have several years yet to run.
Ave or ten or more years ?
When these leases shall have ea
pired it will thed be time to consider
their I-tting. In Justle to the city we
trust that his honor, 8 B Hicks,
mayor pro te, ,will decline to sign
this lease.
