THE LETTER THE ANSWER
November 28, 1923.
The Rev. W. Rothwell,
Claremont, Minnesota.
My Dear Brother Rothwell:
I have your letter of November 24
relative to the publicity given ,my
name in connection with the National
Vigilance Association.
It is true that I had agreed to the
use of my name on the National Com
mittee seeing on the letterhead sent
me the names of some of the most
reputable and sane men in the var
ious states of the nation; among them
the Governor and Lieutenant Gover
nor of this State. The papers did not
represent properly my own statement
which was that these names were
presented oh the printed list of the
Committee. The organization sup
posedly was for the conservation of
law and legal procedure under the
Constitution and not to fight any
single group. As an educator, I was,
with a score of other college presi
dents, interested in what would em
phasize the necessity of such conser
vation. It has been heralded, how
ever, as if I were interested in a per
sonal fight to destroy the Ku Klux
Klan, which is a matter in which I
have only passing interest. Many of
the tenents of this organization are
worth while; the only trouble being
that in their creed in believing in law
and order their procedure seems to
be contrary in their un-American
method of covering up their identity
and their procedure in frequent cases
of taking law into their own hands.
I am, however, only interested in
the constructive program and not in
any anti conditions whatsoever, be
lieving that things which have real
worth in them will continue to exist,
and that things lacking in such worth
will speedily pass.
I appreciate your taking interest
enough to write, though I presume
our preachers would do well to side
step relation to any organization of
any kind which is so radical and un-
Christian as to endeavor to develop
devisive methods between races and
religions. .What we need in our day
is more of brotherhood, and in doing
so it need not mean that we are not
worldly wise enough to see that the
inheritance of our fathers in a pro-'
testant nation is thoroughly safe
guarded. ,
ST. JAMES POP-GU
Somebody at St. James, Minn., has
a grudge against the Call of the
North—he or she sent us a copy of
the “Windypendent” filled with
“odors.” We don’t mind having over
ripe tomatoes or ancient eggs thrown
at us by “tolerant backyard cats,” but
we can’t overloojc the son-of-a
swamp-slipmuckero-kokus mixing our
mail with compost.
The “Windypendent” is a weekly
spasm of whimpereens which is being
inflicted on a long suffering public at
St. James. It looks like a movie
screen that has come in contact with
a cateract of tobacco juice or a roller
towel used by the printer’s devil. The
pages reek with mad screeches char
acteristic of that mental type which
is properly placed in a padded cell.
One Heavyhash mixes a stew that is
a most delectable dish for web-footed
sloppersnappers and then smears it
generously over the pages of the
Windypendent.
Come, Heavyhash, pull up a chair
and let us have a heart to heart talk.
Just how many fanatics do you know
that hold membership* in the Klan.
Please uncork your mighty intellect
and tell us just what the Klansmen
have done in your neighborhood that
stamps them as outlaws. You insist
that the Klan is a lawless organiza
tion—don’t generalize so much, but
name a single instance under your
observation where the Klan has tak
en law into its own hands. Just one,
Heavyhash! Dumboozled, eh? We
caught your catbird that time. Show
us your stuff or we'll have to write
you down as a deliberate pandered

Cordially yours,
S. M. KERFOOT,
President.
Dr. Samuel F. Kerfoot,
St. Paul, Minn.
Dear Doctor:
The foregoing letter I read with
much interest. I note that you ac
cuse the Ku Klux Klan of being “un-
American,” because that great organ
ization covers up its identity and
“frequently takes the law into their
own hands.” Of course, I assume
that you have evidence of this and
I would certainly appreciate it very
much if I might be favored with
names, dates and place of at least one
instance, proving this broad state
ment. Doctor, please do not general
ize, but be specific. We hope you
will not hedge and squirm, but get
down to facts.
Frankly, I don’t grasp the mean
ing of the last paragraph in your
letter. I was not aware that the
Klan was using methods that were
“devisive between races and reli
gions.” I have always supposed that
the Klan conceded the right of every
individual to practice any religion he
chose, provided he does not use it for
political purposes. You, Doctor, not
being af member of the Ku Klux Klan,
know whereof you write. We trust
that you will give us definite infor
mation, clearly presenting real proof,
showing that the world’s greatest
Protestant organization is what your
accusations point it to be.
If it is un-Christian to believe in
separation of church and State, then
the Klan is no more un-Christian
than the Constitution of the United
States, or, in fact, than the Meth
odist or other Evangelical churches
which stand forth on the same basis.
I will be glad 'to learn of that
brotherhood you speak about which is
at present seeking to safeguard the
inheritance of our Fathers within
this Protestant nation.
In closing, let me urge a fore
square answer and emphasize the im
portance of facts, and 1 the foolishness
of fancies.
Awaiting an early reply, I am,
Yours for Protestants that Protest,
P. J. ORN,

of falsehoods, a lie monger in other
words.
Your little periodical spasms of pie
bald piffle is only as a fly scratching
the cuticle of an elephant. Your
caterwaulings only provoke laughter
from your neighbors who tolerate you
as they would a pup-dog and coddle
you into the belief that you are an
editor. The fact that your 800 a week
circulation is on the decline should,
however, serve as a gentle reminder.
Heavyhash Dear, apply unto thy
self your gangreenus gab and spike
your bazoo, you are making a fool of
yourself. Every community has its
coocoo-nut and from all reports you’re
it in St. James.
For a “little feller” you make a lot
of noise, but your enti-Klan fight is
vain. You might as well go out, af
ter the evening meal, and bay at ihe
moon as to fill much space in your
“groaner” with attacks on the Klan,
expecting tp accomplish your pur
poses. Heavyhash, if you could have
seen the pile of letters sent to the
Call of the North after the “expose”
thanking us for the write-up, you’d
call a bootlegger so that you might
give your ego a stimulent. The only
reason we are coming back at you is
to let you know that you didn’t silence
us with your pop-gun publication.

a wall, you’ll injure yourself.” Come
Heavyhash, get out of the pantry, the

ENLIGHTENMENT * rlHl" S
GEORGE WASHINGTON—Pro
mote, then, as an object of primary
importance, institutions for the gen
eral diffusion of knowledge. In pro
portion as the structure of a govern
ment gives force to public opinion, it
should be enlightened.
THOMAS JEFFERSON—If a na
tion expects to be ignorant and free
in a state of civilization, it expects
what never was and never will be.
JOHN JAY—I consider knowledge
to be the soul of the Republic, and
as the weak and the wicked are gen
erally in alliance, as much care
should be taken to diminish the num
ber of the former as the latter.
JOHN ADAMS—Laws for the lib
eral education of youth * * * are
so extremely wise and useful that to
a humane and generous mind, no ex
pense for this purpose would be
thought extravagant.
JAMES MADISON —Knowledge
will forever govern ignorance; and
a people who mean to be their gover
nors must arm themselves with the
power which knowledge gives.
HORACE MANN—The common
school is the greatest discovery ever
made by man. Other social organi
zations are curative and remedial;
this is a preventative and an anti
dote. They come to heal disease and
wounds; this, to make the physical
and moral frame invulnerable to
them.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN—I view it
(education) as the most important
subject we as a people can be engaged
DANIEL WEBSTER—On the dif
fusion of education among- the people
rests the preservation and perpetua
tion of our free institutions.
HERBERT HOOVER—The nation
as a whole has the obligation of such
measures toward its children, as a
whole, as will yield to them an equal
opportunity at their itart in life.
CHARLES EVANS HUGHES—
The American ideal is the ideal of
equal educational opportunity, not
merely for the purpose of enabling *
one to know how to earn a living and
to fit into an economic status more or
less fixed, but of giving play to talent
and inspiration and to development
of mental and sipirtual power.
PRESIDENT WARREN HARD
ING —The Federal Government should
extend aid to the States»for the pro
motion of physical ecracation, the
Americanization of the foreign-born,
the eradication of illiteracy, the bet
ter training of teachers, and for pro
moting free educational opportunity
for all the children of the people.
H. A. L. FISHER—That nation
which employs the best teachers with

Dear “Twilight:”
Arrived in this fair city last Tues
day night, by buss. Will tell the
world we were glad to get here. Folks
tell us this is only about 95 miles
from the Cities. We traveled 195
miles: Ninety-five miles straight
ahead and 100 miles up and down.
What I am trying to say is, the road
was sort of rough.
Lot of folks here all “het” up over
the Ku Klux Klan and it’s no won
der they are; the Klan here is one
“hot baby.” A fever heat, you might
say. Some of the boys on the out
side have the fever so bad that old
man «{, B. has to carry a club to keep
’em from coming in faster than be
can write their cards. He’s lucky in
that he formerly was a school teacher
and writes with both hands. He had
to stop using his typewriter as the
bearings got hot and burned out. We
took a swing around LeSueur and
Nicollet Counties last week and talk
ed to a lot of Klansmen and a lot of
men who wanted to be Klansmen.
Most of their wants were fulfilled.
Most of them are Klansmen now. We
naturalized one class in a cow stable.
They aren’t “the Bull’ either, y but
sure he American citizens,
and a ‘rearing to go. .We hate to

think what will happen to the boot
leggers in these three counties pres
ently.
Talked to one old gentleman who
fought in the Civil war, he informed
us in rather forceful language that he
certainly was a 100% American if
there was any such animal and the
room got so hot when he told us what
he thought of the people who are
fighting the Klan that we had 'to open
the windows. By that time neighbors
had started to gather in and we had
quite a party. One nice red-headed
lady told us we ought to go see her
nephew Charley in St. Paul, so we are
going to send Charley’s address to
the Mayor and let nature take its
course.
Our friends, the self-appointed en
emy, have confined their activities in
this community to spreading the usual
anti-stuff and are trying to put forth
the idea that Klansmen are sworn
Vigilantes and if the officers of the
law don’t enforce the laws, the Klan
will disregard the officers and enforce
the laws themselves. I wonder how
they get that way. Here we have
been telling the world what our prin
ciples, our aims and methods of oper
ation are, for eight years and some
folks haven’t learned yet, I can excuse
ignorance but I haven’t ever had
Inuch use tor a bonehead or dumbbell.

of education which undermines the
religion of youth.”—Cardinal Gib

try are sinks of moral pollution and
nurseries of hell.”—The Chicago Tab

“The public schools have produced
nothing but a Godless generation of

Church is a damnable heresy.”—Syl
labus of Pope Pius IX, issued in 1864.
“It will be a glorious day in this
country when, under the laws, the
school system will be shivered to
pieces.”—Catholic Telegraph.
“The children of the public schools
turn out to be horsethieves, scholastic
counterfeiters and well versed in
schemes of deviltry. I frankly con
fess that Catholics stand before the
country as the enemies of the public
schools. They are afraid that the
child that left home in the morning
would come back with something in
his heart as black as hell.”—Priest
Phelan, St. Louis, Oct., 187$.
“Education must be controlled by
Catholic authorities, and. under edu-
opinions of the individuals
, and utterances of the press are in
cluded, and many opinions are to be
forbidden by the secular arm, under
the authority of the church, even to
and bloodshed.”—Priest Hecker,
quoted by Catholic World, July, 1870.

“Unless you suppress the public
school system, as at present conduct

ILIGHT”
Also would like Ho suggest that some
of our inventor friends put on the
market a device to stiffen knees and
an artificial back bone. These de
vices could be used on weak-kneed
Protestants who have shoe strings in
stead of back bones. Here is a won
derful opportunity for somebody. A
man sprung a new one on us the
other day. He said, “Young man,
you'll have to be some salesman, if
you sell me the Klan idea.” We told
him we didn’t aim to sell him any
thing, and if he was the sort of a man
who had to be sold on the idea of
being an American citizen, and stand
ing up and telling the cockeyed world
about it, we couldn’t be bothered with
him.” He is one of these noon-day
luncheon boys who boost their com
munity and holler, “Trade at home,”
then go to the cities to buy an over
coat and votes against improved
streets. Says he won’t obey the
eighteenth amendment because it in
terferes with his personal liberty and
was so patriotic that he waited until
liberty bonds were worth SB7 before
he bought any. Say, buddy, I sure do
love a guy like that.

WHAT AVAILETH A CAR
LOAD OF REPORTS?
-K-K
ST. PAUL MUST BE SCRUBBED CLEAN!
-K-K
The Mayor of St. Paul, Mr. Nel
son, seems to be having one heck of
a time getting reports from the Chief
of Police, Mr. Sommer, pertaining to
the vice conditions of the Unsaintly
City. Why the Chief of Police should
withhold reports requested by the
Mayor is beyond understanding, but
what will the Mayor do with the re
ports when he gets them? We will
wager an oriental duck-footed bull
frog against a fur-lined bathtub,
that the reports which the Chief
might eventually submit to the Mayor
will read like a soused sailor’s mid
night call, “Thirteen bells and all’s
well.” It is natural to expect that
Chief Sommer will give St. Paul a
clean bill of health and possibly even
point out that St. Paul is as free from
vice as a baby’s cradle, but every
citizen of the capital city who has
made any effort to learn true condi
tions understands to some extent
that St. P*ul is anything but free
from preventable vice conditions.
Your Honor Mr. Nelson, we suggest
that you make a direct investigation
and not bother with the Central Po
lice Station. It would be well to start
off this investigation with oqe Ma
dame Clifford’s joint, that is located
within a stone’s throw from the
Chief’s office. Then continue along
the line and look into the many third
grade hotels operating under a cloud.
At the same time, do not overlook
the “mule-holes” that do a flourish
ing business. When you conduct this
investigation do not close your eyes
to the big guns and jump only on the
little fellows. There are a number
of back-alley dogs doing business and
apprehended from time to time with
a big flourish of publicity. How
ever, we rarely hear about the ar
rest of Black Marias in businessman
a large scale. We understand why
the big birds get away so easily. If
the present police administration
can’t clean up St. Paul, make a plean
sweep of that administration, so as
to make possible the installation of
an administration which has the
ability to bring about the necessary
results.
The Call of the North appeals to
the better elements of St. Paul, urg
ing a keener interest in the moral
welfare of our city. St. Paul is not
a safe place in which to raise a fam
ily, in that temptations are so nu
merous as to make it difficult for the
young folks to withstand them. You
can’t walk down the streets of St.
Paul in the downtown section at the
midnight hour without encountering
a large number of young folks under
the influence of liquor. In the wee
hours \of the morning you see girls
in their early teens wandering around
with fellows loud-mouthed and low
charactered. What are the good peo
ple of St. Paul thinking of, anyway,
sitting silently and indifferently when
there is so much work demanding
their attention ? Let every pulpit de
liver sledge-hammer blows at the
powers waxing fat on commercial
ized vice. Not long ago a raid was
made op slot-machines operating in
St. Paul. Yet today '4 slot-machines
are found in many places. We un
derstand that the slot-machines raid
ed belong to a group of men who are
not citizens of Sf. Paul. Someone has
called our attention to a current ru
mor, pointing out that the slot-ma
chines now in operation are owned
by local men. We would like to
know if inside men get a permit to
operate their slot-machines. We
would like to know who grants these
permits and under what conditions,
providing facts show that some slot
machine “rings” may operate in St.
Paul and some may not.
Not infrequently we get requests
from people of St. Paul, asking that
we turn the searchlight of publicity
upon conditions prevailing within
the city. When we approach indi
viduals denjanding publicity request
ing that they take a stand with the
Call of the North and help us sub
stantiate the reports they turn in,
there is a scurry for the tall timbers.
The old excuse we hear over and over
again, stating, “Here are the facts,
but for goodness sake keep us out
of it.” We have no time for the yel
low-livered individuals who haven’t
' $2.00 A YEAR. 6c A COPY
the courage to go down the line in
a battle for better conditions. The
spineless citizen, knowing facts which
would reveal the exact conditions,
slinks to one side and thus permits
matters to go from bad to worse.
We know thatX courage is a neces
sary element in battling for right
eousness. Up to date this courage
has been lacking to a startling de
gree. Any man or woman who will
join hands with the Call of the North
can accomplish much in making our
fair city, St. Paul, a better place in
which to live and raise a family.
Alibis are useless, hedging is out of
place, dodging is unadulterated cow
ardice. What we want is the man
and the woman who not only is will
ing to report facts but dares to stand
determinedly for a thorough .investi
gation, willing to take a part in any
possible court action.
The Cgll of the North is out to get
any public officials who fail to do
their duty. We want people to know
every instance of failure, so that the
electorate may use the ballot-box as
effectively as a good housewife uses
a broom. There is no need for pay
rollers, who are more interested in
their salary checks than their oaths
of office. We must have officials who
truly appreciate the necessity for do
ing their duty, regardless of whether
it involves the rich or the poor. The
underdog can be browbeaten and in
timidated so as to police rec
ords look like some things they are
not. Although all petty violators of
the law should be punished, yet if we
can wipe out the big birds the little
fellows will hunt their holes.
We don’t care who the police offi
<ials are, so lopg as they do their
duty. If Chief Sommer can clean up
St. Paul, much power to him. If he
can’t let’s get rid of him—the sooner
the better. When the Chief of Police
starts a real clean-up of the capital
city, all real St. Paulites will get le
hind him. The Call of the North is
patiently waiting for action—and ac
tion so effective that every brothel,
every gambling joint, every booze
den, every dope-hole, every low-down
hotel is closed and every grafter,
every vice agent, every imp of hades,
is apprehended and placed before the
bar of justice and fearlessly punished
to the limit ow the law.
Come, folks, all of you who believe
in a cleaner St. Paul, pull off your
coats, roll up your sleeves and do
your duty. Do it with a determina
tion whiuh will brook no intimida
tion of any kind. Enter into the
housecleaning with a fearlessness
born of an .awakened citizenship.
TRI-STATE MEETING
OF ELAN SUCCESS
Baltimore, Md.—The Klansmen of
the Mary land, Deleware and Virginia
shore staged a great ceremony at
Pocomeke City.
Pocomoke Klan had raised a fiery
cross on the fair grounds, thirty-five
feet in height and at 8 o’clock in the
evening the parade of several hun
dred Klansmen led by a large band
started and paraded the city. After
the parade |the cross was lighted and
by its light Dr. Burke, of Ocean City
Klan, Realm of Maryland, delivered
a very forceful address on the prin
ciples and purposes of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan to several thou-
sand people who received it with
great enthusiasm. He was applauded
to the echo.

KLAN FLOAT AWARDED
FIRST PRIZE AT FAIR
Williston, Fla.—A beautiful and
spectacular float, entered by the Levy
Cbunty Klan was awarded first prize
recently at the Levy County Com
munity fair here.
The float led a parade of several
hundred Klansmen and was attrac
tively decorated with American flags,
surmounted by a huge, electrically
illuminated fiery cross. The Knights
were mounted and the pageant was
unusually spectacular.
This is the first instance, so far
as is known here, of a Klan having
beea awarded highest honors at any
state or county fair.
