MAKING UP A CASE.-Our friends
throughout Louisiana can beat the Yc
world "making up a case." Nopoint cc
of law, rhyme or reason is left unqnuot- Y
ed, unshown up, or unverified by affi- In
davits-but you see the people we I)
are dealing with have about as much tr
respect for law and right as a Hotten

ups" simply cost a good deal of money
and will go to "make nup" a few pages
of flabby history that might be adorn
ed with the recital of a vigor display

will have courage for the future when
our brethren "make up" their ninds
to quit talking and act. ,

Somne Radical organ has nsuggested
that Packard is a "self-made man."
To our mind, that fict relieves God
Alnmighty of a fearful responsibility. o,
It is in order for the "I told you Ci
so''s" to make a suggestion, as to how m
it shonld have been done. All we Io
ask, as the afflicted party, is, for one
to speak at a time-we will help kill Ij
the others when the first o~e has th
finished his any. ,
The "Independent camp" of Red th
River was most humbly slaughtered it
by that pink of Radical representa- tl
tive darkness, Andy Bosley. String- di
fellow, on hi8 early political pinions th
was clipped beaotifully, leaving the
real people of thpt parish to suffer st
the insult of such a representation as K
the negro Bosley, while by a united
effort Russ, the choice of the people
could have been elected, tn
?When the people of Red River begin of
to treat these Independents as they D
deserve to be treated, as enemies
worse than Radicals, they will find n
themselves in a mchl better condi- a
tion politically and otherwise.
That fearless, alhe and outspoken
journal, the New Orleans Democrat, at
announces that it will shortly appear
as a morning instead of an evening
daily, as at present, and that it will be
complete in all its parts as a first class
paper. This news is cheering, in
deed, and we sincerely believe that be
the people of the State will give it a ol
full support. Good luck to Messrs. a
Hearsey and Dupre. s
The weather for the past week has fe

Two More Ineligible Electors.
New Orleans, Nov. 17.-The Even
ing Democrat says two of the Re
pliciºihan electors in Louisiana had
offices of profit and trust under the
Tnited States at the time they were
Ivoted for and are therefore ineligible.
0. H. Brewster was United States
Snrveyor General for Louisiana and
offllicial documents signed by hii da
ring the canvass are ill existence. The
day after election lie Silet on his re
signation and it is believed anteda
ted it to cure his ineligibility.
Judge A. HB. Levisee, another Hayes
elector, is, we are informed, a United
States conlmissioner, an office of profit
and trust, and lhe is therefore ineli
gible.
The five Radical electors will ran
further behind the Radical ticket li
the Fourteenth Senatorial District
than was at first expected. Almost
all of the tickets of the Wakefield
R:tlical faction were printed with the
namnes of only three electors, the two
at large, Kellogg and Burch, and the
elector for that District, Joffrion.
The consequenco is that the other
five electors are behind 675 ii West
Baton Ionge, 400 in Iberville and
coilsiderably behinul also in St. Mar
ti ainl Iheria. It is iimposs.i le to
say juust now how great this deficien
cv is, hat it is certliiily over 1000 and
may le as great as 2(101).
New Orleans, Nov. 18.- It is stated
tlhat five Republican electors are
Federal office holders.

Desperate Game of the Radicals
New Orleans, Nov. 18, 1876.-Kel
logg and Radical leaders held a can
cus after the reception of thile South
Carolina news and aplpinted a com-n
mittee of Noyea., of Ohio; Low Wal
lance, of Intiana; and Kasson, of
Iowa, to go intediately to Florida
and have that State counted for
Hayes. They left on thile early train
this morning and will be followed
biy Stanley Mathews this afternoon.
Northern Radicals assertetd last nlight
that they would have Soith Carolina,
and this mnorning their dispatches say
it has been counted in that way,
though Hamnpton has been officiallly
declared elected Governor. Next
they will count Florida and Louisi
ana for Hayes. That lhas been de
cided upon and Kellogg made the
statemelnt last night while with IHale,
Kasson and Sherman.
Another Adjournment.

Democratic State Central Committee
offered a protest against the judlicia

not let hin read it. The Board
agreed to admit five each of the lead
