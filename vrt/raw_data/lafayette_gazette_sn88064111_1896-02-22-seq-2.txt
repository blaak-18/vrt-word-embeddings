When Capt. Pharr accepted the
nomination for governor it was with
the understanding that he would do
ao campaign work on Sunday.
The Lake Charles American pays
the following high compliment to
Judge G. A. Fournet of the 12th
Judicial district. Judge Fournet is
a man of fine ability- and a Demo
crat of the old school. He is a
brother to Hon. A. V. Fournet,
nominee for treasurer. The A,neri
can says: "'Judge Fournet is now
on the bench. He values his posi
tion as he does his life, and as his
educated conscience insists on the
purity of the one, so it also insists
on the purity of the other. The
people know the value of an up
right and Industrious judge and will
make it easy for the incumbent to
retain his seat. One of the Ameri
can citizen's most valued preroga
tives is in faultfinding with the hold
ers of public offices. This privi.
lege is used most freely and some
times, we regret to say, with justice.
Here, however, we have a surprising
exception."
It is a gratifyng fact to us that
the outspoken manner in which we
have denounced the negro herding
engaged in by the politicians in this
parish has met with the unqualified
approval of the best element in the
community. In our career as a
journalist we have found that a
plain statement of the truth and ad
vocacy of rtght principles are not
always received with favor by the
public at large, hence to be right
and to have one's position approved
by thTe best element of the commu
nit. is Sa experience as gratifying
as it is rare. The public at large
coidemn the corrupt. pandering on
the part of r'the politicians to a
debased negro sentiment, and while
such methodd fiidy prevaiFfor a time

WAM. PITT KELLOGG.
Wm. Pitt Kellogg, the arch-enemy
of Louisiana, the enemy of decent
and honest government, the relent- i
less foe of white rule; the man who 4
hates the very words of white su
premacy, the unscrupulous scoun- 4
drel who has so often arrayed the
negroes against the whites, so that
he might be elected to offices of
trust in order to rob and plunder, is
presently engaged in the nefarious
occupation of massing the negroes
for the purpose of putting John
Pharr in the gubernatorial chair.
Since the establishment of honest,
white government the old devil has
remained away from this State, com
ing down only when his services
were needed to arouse the baser
passions of the negroes and to ex
cite their race prejudices. He be
lieves that there is a possibility of
overthrowing Democratic rule and
reinstating Kelloggism, and while
laboring under that belief he has
again appeared in the State which
he has once disgraced by being its
governor. If Messrs. McCall and
Jim Wilkinson, who have been
charging the Democratic party with
corruption, can not find a more re
spectable person than William Pitt
Kellogg to pl-.ad their cause, they
had better quit. The idea of Kel
logg talking- about corruption and
reform is about the greatest illus
tration of gall ever heard of. Kel
lrogg posing as a jeformer! Speak
ing of Democratic corruption! It
is conceded that he is the worst of
all the carpet-baggers, and God
knows they were all bad. He has
not only fostered the rankest gov
ernmental license and robbery dur
ing his term of office, but he has
been the direct cause of the com
mission of all the crimes in the cal
endar, which were the natural re
sults of his inflammatory speeches
to the negroes, the most ignorant of
that race having always considered
him a demi-god.
To those of our people who have
been made to believe that the negro
question was used in this campaign
merely as a scare-crow to prevent
timid folks from voting for Phair,
the candidate of the Republican
and People's parties, we will say
that Kellogg has been sent for and
is at his old tricks again. On Sat
urday, the 15th of this month, he
made a speech at Baton Rouge t
3000 negroes; Tom Cage and other
negroes made speeches also. After
the speaking the negroes lin.d up
as oi old and paraded the streets of
Baton Rouge. The very fact that
Kellogg has taken the stump for
Pharr should be ample warning to
the Democrats that if they desire to
prevent a recurrence of the horrors
of reconstruction they must support
the Democratic ticket, at the head
of which stands Murphy J. Foster,
the man who has given Louisiana
four years of clean, white govern
ment.
We invite attention o the follow
ing remarks of the Memphis Com
mercial-Appeal of recent date under
the heading "Vain Gathering of the
Cormorants:"
"Who has encouraged their pres
ence this year? Who has held out
any hope to them that they may
again have an opportunity of bat
tening on the prosperity of Louis
iana? Are there any Democrats
who are willing to have their pies
ence made permanent-a presence
as disgusting to tl-e sight and smell
as thie vultures that perch about the
I towers of silence of Bombay, and as
inimical to progress as Kellogg's
- army of boodlers during reconstruc
tion days? If there are such, then
the miseries of the past have been
in vain and the triumphs of patriot
- ism of no effect. "I1 am Going to
vote against you this time," said
Sone of Gen. Jackson's constituents
to him one day. "I have been
£ghting the battles of the country
that you may have that right," re
· sponded Old Hickory. Democrats
Shave a right, they declare, to prove
srecreant to the party which has
brought them out of a condition of
e vertual serfdom to an exalted plane;
a but we are not ready to concede
a that much. There should, in fact,
be an obligation on the part of
every honest man and patriot to
Ssupport a movement for his coun
t try's good and antagonize that which
will cripple its industries, corrupt
its society, destroy its commerce,
Smake b-ggars of its populace and
e put 'black heels on white necks.'
SNo greater villains ever scuttled a
a ship than those endeavoring and
e hoping to get another foothold in
e the South. But Louisiana will
guard her own."

STATE CONVICTS.
The voters of Louisiana will have
an opportunity to say at the election a
next April if they are in favor of a
change -from the present system of
working the State's convicts. One
of the amendments to be voted on
provides that "No penitentiary con- I
vict shall ever be leased or hired to
any person or persons, or corpora
tion, private or public, or quashi
public, or board. * * * The I
General Assembly may authorize
the employment under State super
vision and the proper officers and I
employes of the State, of convicts
on public roads or other public
works, or on convict farms or man
ufactories owned or controlled by
ti.e State, or any public levee board
or on any public levee under such
provisions and restrictions as may
be imposed by law."
If this amendment is adopted,
and we have no doubt it will be,
after the expiration of the existing
lease convicts will be made to work
by the State, instead of being hired
out as it is now done. A similar
change in the State of Mississippi
has demonstrated the wisdom of
such a move. Aside from the ques
tion of humanity, which should be
pre-eminent in legislation of this
kind, the Mississippi plan of work
ing the convicts under State super
vision is much more profitable, but
a question of money-making should
be secondary in tnis matter. Un
der the present system private in
dividuals or corporations lease the
convicts, and of course they do so
not with the intention of running
summer resorts, but for the sole pur
pose of making all the money they
can, and as most men are chuck
full of humane feeling only when
their pockets are not huit, the poor
convicts are forced to yield nn
reasonably large profits to the
lessees.
The State of Mississippi has ex
clusive control of he. convicts, a
large numb,%r of whom are put to
work on farms which have been
purchased by the State. The re
sults from these farms have been
eminently satisfactory. Reports
show that the net value of products
rais d on the farms amount to the
handsome sum of $70,779.45. The
number of convicts at work was
nine hundred, while the State of
Louisiana receives only $50o.ooo for
the exclusive use of all her convicts.
PUT UP OR SIUT UP.
When a man tells yoti that he will
vote for Pharr because Giov. Fos
ter's administration has Lcen a cor
rupt o',e. just ask hi:n to state one
instance wherein it has been dishon
est. You will clinch him every
time. He will be unable to produce
a scintilla of proof to s ow that he
knows what-he is talking about, be
cause it is an undeniable fact that
the present administration has been
remarkably clean and absolutely
free from any public scandal. It is
easy enough for an irascible wind
jamimer like Jun W\Vlkinson to cle
nounce the Democratic party at a
nigger meeting and for a hoary old
chestnut like Capt Pharr, the be
whiskered chief of the fusionists, to
prate about the angelic purity of the
Republicans, but the people are not
such fools as not to know that these
two worthy gentlemen are simply
filtering their lung power through
the crowns of their hats. The peo
ple know that it is a fact that Gov.
Foster's administration has been
one of the best in the history of the
State that no one can gainsay. It
seems to be the disposition of some
to charge the plesent administration
with being corrupt when it is a well
known fact that no corruption has
been dise losed.

YOI'N(;sVILLE, La., Feb. 18. 1596.
DEAR (;AZET'E:--V'U have not
answered my questions and it is evi
dent that you can not or will not.
You begin your argument (?) and
emnd it by saying that the fact that
Jefferson appointed Mr. Claiborne
governor of Louisiana does not im
ply that the latter was a Democrat.
Why not De frank, Mr. Mouton, and
say you believe he was a Demno rat
Mr. Gresham, at the time ot his
appointment by Mr. (:leveland, was
a Democrat. In selecting Mr. Gre
sham the president was probably in
fluenced by the maxim, "A wise
man sometimes changes his mind; a
fool never."
I am content to await your further
reply to my question, but before
closing this let me say that your at
t mrpt at argument renmind mne of
President l.incoln's story about the
little steamboat with the 5-foot
boiler and 7-foot whistle. W'hen
the whistle blew the boat stopped.
Do you see the oppositeness of
the story to your case?
Respectfully,
BENJ. F. FLANDERS, JR.
The Gazette is willing to rest its
side and as Mr. Flanders appears to
be of the same mind, the case will
go to the jtr-.
NEGROES ORGA IZINvG.
1"DONALDSONVILLE, La., Feb. zo.-(Spe
cial.)-About 300 young colored Republi
cans assembled in the Blue Bucket Hall last s.
evening for the purpose of organizing a Col- o
ored Republican Club. It was organized and
named the Young Men's Republican Club
of Ascension, with Bernard Kelly as presi
dent and Ed Guedry as secretary. Resolu- ti
tions were adopted indorsing Captain I. N. k
Pharr for governor and the ticket he leads."
The above was published in the
City Item of the xzth instant. b
"Three hundred young colored Re- a
publicans" means in plain language
300 young niggers. It can be seen I
from the foregoing special that.they a
have banded themselves together d
for the purpose of defeating Foster r
and electing Pharr, the candidate of h
the Republican and People's par
ties. The Donaldsonville coons
have named their organization "The n
Young Men's Republican Club," h
which, under the leadership of Kel- tl
logg and Cage, will help to over- e
throw white government so that Mr. n
McCall and Mr. Warmoth might be
able to persuade the National Re- e
publican party that it must give b
them a bounty on sugar. The 300 c
young bucks who have just made f
their entrance into Louisiana poli- n
tics are not after bounty, but they
are after political and social recog
nition. They have been told that
when the Republican party was in ,
power in this State members of their c
race were elected to high positions; e
that Dunn, a negro barber, was
lieutenant-governor; that Pinchback
held the same office, and that a
white man in those days was as good c
as a nigger if he behaved himself. t
No one who kne.ws the negro will
doubt for an instant that the mo
tive of the 300 "young colored Re
publicans" in organizing is political t
equality, and knowing that as long
as Democracy rules this State they 1
will remain in the background, they
have taken Kellogg's advice to sup- I
poit the ticket headed by Pharr.
The disgusting sl.ectacle of 6oo
negroes parr ding the streets and.
yelling themselves hoarse for a nig
ger politician is enough to make
self-respecting white citizens hang
their heads in shame. And this is
what the nigger-dicicering that hasl
been conducted by a few white poli
ticians has brought matters to at
last. Serious trouble between the
races is bound to result from such'
methods and when it does come on
the blame will be laid at the door
of the white politicians where it
properly belongs. The streets were
full of drunken swaggering negroes
all Saturday afternoon, and before
this proceeds much further no lady
will oe safe on the streets unpro
tected. This condition of affairs
will not be tolerated by the wi ites
of this city and it is well for those
interested to take warning before it
becomes too late.-Haton Rouge
Advocate.
While in front of Petersburg Gen.
Butler received Information that his
favorite horse, Almond-Eye, had
been acciden.ally killed by falling
into a ravine, say the Boston Her
aid. Upon the departure of his in
forinant he ordered an Irish servant
to go and skin him.
•\'What, is -Almond Eve dead ?
asked Pat.
'W\Vhat's that to you ? Do as I
bid )ou and ask no questions."
Pat went about his business and
in an hour or two returned.
,"Well, Pat, where have you been
all this time ?" sternly demanded
the general.
"Skinnig the horse, yer honor."
'"Does it take nearly two hours to
perform such an operation ?
No, yer honor; but then, you see,
it tuck 'bout half an hour to catch
him," reltlied Pat.
Gen. B.tler cast upon his servant
such a ferocious look that Pat
thought he meditating skinning an
Irishman in revenge for the deati of
his horse.
tThe news tlhat the House Coin
mittee on Contested Elections had
I'made an unanimous report declar
ing that Mr. Chas. F. Buck had
been fairly elected was received in
this city with expression, of
satisfaction because Mr. Buck
is not only a very able man,
tibut poputlar with all classes of peo
ple. The report in favor of Mr.
Buck, however, was not utexpected,
because his majorty of seven thou
sand votes could not be explained
away by the evidence which Mr.
r Coleman submitted to the commit

fMarvelous Itesul Its.
From a letter written by Rev. J. Gunder
t man, of l)tmondale, Mich., we are permitted
to make this extract: "I have no hesitation
in recommending Dr. King's New Discov
ery, as the results were almost marvelous in
f the case of my wife. VWhile t was pastor of
the Baptist Church at Rivers Junction she
was brought down with Pneumonia succeed
ing La (Grippe. Terrible paroxysms of
Scoughing would last hours with little inter
ruption and it seemed as if she could not
survive them. A friend recommended Dr.
SKing's New Discovery; it was quick in its
work and highly satisfactorily in result.

eggs from 270 hens. The total was
nearly a car load of eggs.

Eugene Field's Last Story.
In 1884 Eugene Field wrote a story which
he called "'The Werewolf." Whcn it was
finished he laid it aside and a year after
ward entirely rewrote it. In ISS6 ha again
took it up and revised it, and during the nine
years between that time and his death in
November last, he rewrote it eight times.
His last revision pleased hint and he decided
to print it. But death came too suddenly,
and the story was found, unpublished,
among his effect,. Mrs. Fi-l.l, concluding
to have the story appear, gave it to the edi
tor of The Ladies' Ilome Journal, in which
magazine all of Mr. Field's Mork, outside of
his newspaper articles, was presented to the
