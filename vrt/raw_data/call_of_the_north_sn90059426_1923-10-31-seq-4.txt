—K-K-K—-
P’or the second time within less
than a year, enemies of Americanism
have launched a campaign of destruc
tion, intimidation and threats against
Chicagoans believed to be, or admit
tedly members of the Ku Klux Klan.
The second campaign of .violence
and terrorism was launched early this
week with the bombing of the Forcum
Press, printing establishment of Jack
Forcum, 1107 East 55th street.
Twenty-four hours later another
bomb rocked the South Side, and the
front of the jewelry store of G. A.
Penrose, 61st street and Calumet
avenue, was wrecked.
Damage sustained by these and
other tenants in the buildings bombed
will total hundreds of dollars. By
good fortune no lives were lost.

“Dawn,” a Ku Klux Klan publica
tion, was at one time printed at the
Forcum Press and Mr. Forcum has
been a regular advertiser since the
establishment of the paper, as has
Mr. Penrose. Other advertisers have
received threatening and scurrilous
letters.
No arrests have been made. Only
one arrest and no convictions was
the record of the police department
during the first series of outrages
some months ago.
Klan guardsmen have been- sta
tioned at the residences and business
establishments of other possible vic
tims of the anti-American conspiracy.
Scores of filthy, vicious letters
have been addressed to native born,
white, Protestant, Gentile Chicagoans,
during the past week, evidently in
the belief that these men are mem
bers of the Klan.
This campaign of violence follows
the appearance in “Dawn” of a news
story covering the departure of a
number of “Ragen’s Colts” for Okla
homa, where they planned to aid Jack
Walton in his fight against the Klan.
Unity League Bitter
The so-called American Unity
League of which Patrick H. O’Don
nell is the self-elected “president,”
has boasted of the bitterness of its
campaign against the Klan. Through
“Tolerance,” official organ of the
league, and in public addresses
O’Donnell and other Roman Catholics
have attempted to incite their follow
ers to violence, and have boasted
that they would hound every Klans
man in Chicago to his finish.
While the league’s public activities
against the Klan in this city have
been inconsequential, it is considered'
likely that believers in that organiza
tion’s boycott program may have
been inspired to commit these and
other outrages against men suspect
ed of being Klansmen.
The Unity League, as such, makes
no actual fight on the Klan. Its pro
moters simply use the Ku Klux as a
“bugaboo” with -which to frighten
financial support out of a gullible
public. A reconsideration of facts in
connection with this phase of the
fight against the Klan is peculiarly
interesting at this time in view of
the suit filed against the 100 per cent
American organization in Indian
apolis and the disbarment proceed
ings against Bernard J. Mahony.
“When crooks become known to the
police they frequently assume a new
‘moniker’ and undertake a new ‘lay.’
Now that the promoters of the Amer
ican Unity League,, and of ‘Toler
ance,’ have become so unfavorably
known to the American public as a
result of their questionable financial
transactions and their insincerity of
purpose they have adopted an alias
under which to beg money from the
gullible and have thought up a new
‘racket’ as an excuse for the ‘touch.’ ”
“The new ‘moniker’ is ‘Anti-Klan
Defense Committee.’ The ‘hangout’
is at 1805 Temple Building, 77 West
Jackson street.

KLAN AT CONVENTION.
Richmond, Va.—A. G. Gilmer, an
Olkahoma City attorney, was halted
in the midst of his address before the
International Association of Fire En
gineers today and his talk stricken
from the program when he launched
into an attack on the Ku Klux Klan
after he had described Governor
John C. Walton of Oklahoma as a
“tyrant.” Hearty applause greeted
the ruling of President C. W. Ringer

The ruling was in answer to Will

the Klan was that the order openly
discriminated against a race that

KLAN KALL
N
At Lansing, the capital of Michi
gan, the biggest crowd that ever
assembled in the Prudden auditorium
gathered to hear a speech on the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan last
week. The meeting proved to be
most successful and many who went
there in doubt have since made ap
plication for membership. The ad
dress was one of the most brilliant
ever given in Michigan and hundreds
of persons received their first great
vision of the glorious principles of
the Klan which is growing so rapidly
in this state.

CEREMONIAL ON

i THE FIERY CROSS
Editor, Daily News: On Saturday
evehipg, Oct., 13, at the pavement
dance held on the new pavement on
the Dodd road in West St. Paul, an
incident occurred which I think should
have a word of mention in your pa
per.
During the evening the. “Fiery
Cross," the emblem of that great all-
American organization, the Ku Klux
Klan, was burned. Immediately up
on sighting the beautiful spectacle,
the leader of the orchestra and his
followers struck up that beautiful an
them, “The Star Spangled Banner."
It caused a wonderful sensation to
come over me and I wish to take this
opportunity of congratulating the
leader as well as the whole orchestra
for their thoughtfulness, as it was the
most touching thing I have ever heard
and I cannot conceive of another piece
of music which would have been more
fitting for the occasion.
It pained me very much, however,
to see a number of men who no doubt
call themselves Americans, who failed
to respond in the true American man
ner of removing their hats and pay
ing this small amount of courtesy to
the flag and their country.

KLAN GIVES PICNIC
IN SAN ANTONIO

40,000 People Attend Event Said to
Have Been Largest Held in
Community.
—K-K-K
San Antonio, Tex.—The barbecue
and oicnic given by the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan here recently was
one of the biggest affairs of the kind
ever held in this community.
It is estimated that more than 40,
000 persons attended the affair, and
at the initiation ceremony 1,500 can
didates were initiated into the order.
An imperial representative of the
Klan was the principal speaker and
his talk was enthusiastically receiv
ed by the crowd.
A feature which attracted much at
tention was an aeroplane with an
electric fiery cross, which circled the
field just before the ceremony of in
itiation took place.
OIXCN KUN GIVES TO
NEGRO RAPTIST CHURCH
Dixon, 111. —At the Sunday even
ing service, October 14, at the Col
ored Baptist Church here, the local
organization of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan presented the congrega
tion with an envelope containing four
ten dollar bills.
About three weeks ago the minister
of this congregation' received a letter
ordering him to leave the city within
twelve hours and the letter was
signed K. K. K., which is merely an
other example of the false propa
ganda being sent out by those who
oppose this American organization.
The congregation was told that the
Klan has observed the efforts they
have been.putting forth and wanted
to assure them that as a body the
Klan is in hearty sympathy with
every effort put forth for their ad
vancement spiritually, morally and
socially among themselves.
The congregation was also told
that this donation was given in the
spirit of the Chri t, feeling that it
would be used for the extending of
Christ’s kingdom.
In closing a plea was made for the
unity and oneness of the members of
this church and'they were reminded
of the fact that the burden of Christ’s
heart and the substance of His
prayer was that his followers should
“be one as He and the Father were
one."
The minister responded with his
thanks and assured us that it was
received in the proper spirit, and
would be used in the proper way. He
also said if the Klan is composed of
such men and holds prin
ciples his prayer to God is for more
Klansmen.

SITTING ON THE

—K-K-K—
--FREE SPEECH IS DENIED
BY LOUISVILLE POLICE
—K-K-K
Despite the fact that the police
pf Louisville, Kentucky, acting upon
orders from their superiors, turned
back thousands of persons who were
jeager to hear a lecture been
jgiven there last week on the prin
ciples of the Klan, there was no dis
order whatever. Although the stand
of the police was autocratic, the
Klansmen submitted to the outrage
without attempting to argue the mat
ter and will rely on the courts to
guarantee them free speech. The
speaker was arrested before he had
had a chance to begin his speech. The
same lecturer was arrested in Owens
boro, Kentucky, about three weeks
ago and was acquitted, the court hold
ing that free speech could not be
stopped.
AN AMERICAN
' JUDICIAL ACTION
The grand jury at Richmond, Ky.,
last week refused to indict A. C.
Acker, who was arrested there on
September 18, when he attempted to
deliver a Klan lecture. This is the
third time that anti-Klan forces in
Kentucky have been beaten in at
tempts to stiffle free speech.
THE DIFFERENCE
Father Walter A. Grace, of Denver,
has been indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury for forgery , conspiracy
and illegal transportation of liquor,
according to the Associated Press.
But this nit the interesting part. Any
minister may go wrong. All denomi
nations thus suffer. The interesting
thing is that the Right Rev. J. Henry
Tihen, bishop of the Colorado diocese,
has made a statement to the effect
that he will support this priest and
retain him as he head of his parish.
Herein is the fundamental difference
in the attiude of Romanism and Pro
testantism toward ministers. The
Roman Church has ever protected and
defended its clergy, whatever their
crimes. The Protestant churches
never fail to expel any minister who
has thus behaved himself. Indict a
Protestant minister for forgery, con
spiracy and bootlegging and he could
never preach another sermon in a
Protestant pulpit. No authority in
the Protestant churches would dare
defend such a man. Herein is a differ
ence altogether vital. It is the differ
ence between churches that acknow
ledge the authority of government
and law and a Church that acknowl
edges the authority of the
the Church as greater than that of
civil government and the laws of any
land. At the tap root of the decision
of Bishop Tihen to back his bootleg
ging priest is the big fact that the
Church comes first, the state last. —
