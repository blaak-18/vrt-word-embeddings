SOCI ALI1.
Socialism-A theory of society
which advocates a more precise,
orderly and harmonious arrange
ment of the social relations of man
kind than that which has hitherto
prevailed.-Webster.
No thinking man will controvert
that associated industry is the most
powerful agent of production, and
that the principle of association is
susceptible of further and benefi
cril development.--John Stuart
Mill.
What makes the Republican par
ty appear to btand so high is the
fact that its twin brother, the
Democratic party, has stooped so
low.
The first goldbugs of which we
have any record was the fellows
that mdle the golden calf while
Moses was up in the mount re
ceiving the law.
If the Republicans had the least
conception of the eternal fitness
of things-besides holding office
they would nominate Cleveland for
president.
Mr. Cleveland's "former law
partner" negotiated the bond deal
by which the syndicate that bought
the bonds netted about eight mil
lion dollars profit.
The Globe-Democrat says that
the Republicans will not enter into
any deals with the Populists in the
organization of the Senate, for
which the Populists ought to feel
very grateful.
Clevelad manages to take care
of a many of his cuockoos as he
.can provide nests for. When the
people reject a man it aeemsto
have the edect of rcomnmnding
him to Cbleveland.

Bayon Natchez.
In order to attend the club meet
ing at Bayou Natchez last Satur
day, ye editor got a move on him
self early that morning, and hus- 1
tied off before breakfast to the
depot of the Natchitoches and Red
River Valley railroad.
We should have been left but
for the timely interference of Char- 1
lie Deverennes and his elegant Buss,
which outfit never let any one miss
a train, and on this occasion landed 1
us on the platform in ample time
to hear the "All aboard!" of the
gentlemanly conductor, and as we
curled up in the corner of a seat
next the window, we gave a sigh
of relief as we prepared to take in
the dozens of beautiful landscapes
that lie along the pretty little rail
roa(l.
Our train was 'on tunie" and
before we hardly knew it, we
rounded up at Bayou Natchez sta
tion, where we found our old friend
M. L. Payne, standing on the plat.
form. We flattered ourself that
he was waiting for us, but when
we saw some freight being rolled
out of the baggage car and turned
over to him, we began to "hedge"
} for an invitation to breakfast. We
hadn't long to wait, for his most
excellent little wife who was just
clearing away the fragments of
their morning meal, rattled the
dishes a few times and spread us a
repast which completely absorbed
our attention for about 20 minutes,
and was as completely absorbed
by us in the same length of time.
Bro. Payne then walked with us
down to the elegant iron bridge,
which our police jury is having
constructed over the Bayou Natch
ez, here we formed the acquaint
ance of the intelligent and pleas
ant o0l engineer, Mr. Sullivan,
who is superintending the work,
and he was kind enough to show
the details in the building, and
made our half hour's stay there
very pleasant.
We then went over m the town
and made the acquaintance of some
of the pleasantest mercantile men
the State affords. Mr. Hyman
Jaffa, whose large store, so well
stocked with all kinds of goods, is
first on going out from the depot,
and the Messrs. Friedman, and
their salesman Mr. Linder, who
make it pleasant for the public that
throng their well filled store which
stands just below the postoffice,
(Natches).
We found all these gentlemen so
affable and courteous that we soon
began to feel quite at home among
them, and found in the evening
that the day was entirely too short.
After a sumptuous dinner, again
with Bro. Payne and his acoom
plished lady, we gave ourself over
to the club meeting, which we en
joyed immensely, but not more so
than the lively chats with several
members who lingered awhile after
the meeting to talk with the genial
sadentertainingNatche merchante.
In these pleaesat rejoinders we
spent the last moment aof our time
ad had to run to catch the "smoke
wagoa."
We were mvited to "oome
again," sad hope it won't be long
besfor we an do so.
We gave ourselves up to reve
ris while the "iroa borse" whirled
- on toward the "Quaint City,"
sad we thought so much about the
sunshi ae ga d - that had
Aled ever one's heart ad voice
that afternoon, t we oocaionly
looked oat of the window to see
the glories a go#ls snset, only
to be reminded that It had been

More Confidence.
The Daily Picayune of the let
inst. endeavors to show in its lead
ing editorial that this country does
not need more money, but more
contidence.
After laboring through more
than 2-thirds of a column in a vain
endeavor to produce some statis
tics and arguments, it concludes
thusly:
Therefore it is not more money,
but more confidence, which is need
ed now. There is no lack of mon
ey, but a great lack of business
confidence.
There you have it now, boys!
If you've no money to supply your
plantation, just go to town and
give your merchant confidence. orI
rather tell him to have confidence
in you.
But first you had better try it on
a man who understands the situa
tion, so just you write the editor of
the lic. to send you his Daily
($12.0(1 a year) "on confidence."
That will he getting some of it
into circulation.
Only the day before, that "blast
ed fool" wrote, in his leading edi
torial, denouncing the income tax
as unconstitutional, the following:
It is very natural that the masses
of the people should wish to make
the wealthy classes pay all the tax
es; but, even if it were justified
by the Federal constitution, the re
sult would he wholly different from
what would be popularly expect
ed. The taxes might be all collect
ed from the rich men, but they
could get it all back by raising the
rate of interest on the money they
loan, by raising the rents of their
real estate, by collecting heavier
charges on the freights transported
on their railroads, in the prices of
their manufactures anmd imports,
and in a hundred other ways, so
that the consumers, the masses of
the people, would have to pay for
it all. The consumers pay all the
taxes under any circumstances.
They are the only people who have
no means of getting the tax back
from any other class.
Read it agam, and see how well
these thieving goldbugs understand
the miserable condition they have
placed you in.
Don't you think a laboring man
who would vote for a goldbug, or
a party that nominates one for of
fice, should be drummed out of a
free country l
Often m glancing over the col
umns of the old party papers we
see it stated that some populist
paper has suspended publication
(which may have occurred six
months ago; they never get through
canting about st), and the piece
generally ends with some contempt
ible slur about the People's party
being too poor to support its press.
Yes; the People's party is poor,
financially; it is composed of poor
people; its press must depend up
on the poor people for its mainten
ance. The party is not dominated
by pampered ahylocks; its press is
not subsidized and corrupted by
the man with money. That the
party is poor, is an assurance that
it is the party for the people-the
party that will be the means of the
poor people achieving the grand
est victory over plutocracy that
was ever recorded in the political
history of any country.-Sabinal,
Texas, Sentinel.
We have settled one point. No
body any longer has the hardihood
to deny the existence of syste
matic election frauds in Louisiana.
But some still have the effrontery
to claim that such methods Cre
used for the benefit of the party.
We protest against suchan assump
tion. Fraud was never used for
the benefit of nor with the sanction
of Demooracy. It is always em
ployed for the selfish purposes of
corrupt and tunsecrupulous politi
cians who have not the slightest
lo nception of what a true Demo
crat is. Let them cmsse to hide
behind the clod at the party which
they have disraced. They will
-have to retreat from one subter

I am asked when I think the next
spasm of panic will hit the coun
try. I am not a prophet, but it
seems to me that it will be hitting
e\cry day until the very life willt
be knocked out of the commercial
world. No relief can be given un
til changes in the national princi
ples of finance ale made by con
gress. The continual dropping of I
firms is not so noticeable and is
safer for the money power than a
sudden shock. The trusts are
sweeping into their purse all the
wealth of the nation, The only 1
safe plan is to be your own banker
and tide over the next five years.
Recognized slavery or freedom will
be on the boards by January 1,
1900, or the struggle will be in I
progress.-Coming Nation.
The New York Herald, March
10, prints evidence in a contest
election case which shows that
votes were bought for $1 each by
thousands. Of course the old par
ties did this for the public good!
They were afraid the anarchist re
formers might prevail! And thus
the people who ought to know bet
ter support self-confessed thieves,
robbers, blackmailers and embez
zlers, but refuse to listen to a re
former's appeal to ch:ange the so
cial system that creates opportuni
ties for these reprobates. They
never heard of a socialist or popu
list buying votes or over-riding
laws. They are not even accused
of being dishonest. But they are
dangerous to society! And these
self confessed bribers and thieves
are not!--Coming Nation.

MARIE AZEMIA [)ENNISTON WAL
born in the city of Natchitoches,
La.. January 1st, 1+44, and was
the daughter of David and Azemia
D)enniston, who poured out their
entire affections upon this and one
other daughter. Lo' ingly, ten
terly th,,ý sister gFrew into 1 ,man
hood under the influence of their
loved religion and the tender watch
care of fond parents.
In the early blush of woman
hood with all the lovely graces and I
acconlmplishluents of that romantic
time, Marie was given in marriage
to Emile Tauzin, February 15th,
1860. That union was blesqsed with
a daughter-her only child, but
the beauty and romance of the
morning o her life seemed to but
forecast dark shadows that should
imake its evening so tender and
sub~hme.
When her child was scarcely weo
months old her husband was taken
from her, February 21st 1861,
leaving her a widow and mother at
the yet tender age of seventeen.
Her parents both dlead, she went to
live with her sister, then Mrs.
Blanchard, where she bore her af
flictions with patience anti christi
an fortitude, and reared her daught
er, now Mrs. Emily Rachal of
Cloutierville, to womanhood, en
lowing her with those womanly
virtues and christian graces that
made her own life so beautiful.
When nearly twenty years had
allowed Father Time to heal the
deep afflictions of the past and
partially remove the scars caused
of early heartwounds, grown more
lovable still by the humility of her
deep christian life and the gentle
ness that comes only by acquaint
ance with grief, she decided to
again assume the duties and res
ponsibilities of married life, and
became the wife of Capt. H. P.
Gallien, February 3rd, 1880.
This marriage imposed upon her
the delicate and responsible task of
being a mother to strange children
--of overcoming their natural
prejudice to what they thought an
intrusion in the family, and win
ning their love. And here is where
most brightly shown the beauty of
her christian life, her self control
and self denial, and her devotion to
her husband and all his interests,
greatest of which were his children.
To say that she succeeded is ex
pressing it mildly. Her husband
rejoiced in her devotion and her
love, and his children loved her as
a mother, which she was mdeed,
But while her private life was so
true and lovable, her public life
was equally useful and beautiful m
ts strength of character and pur
pose. Christened in the Catholic
church and brought up under its
beneficient influences, it received
her lubors of love from almost
childhood to the day of her death,
and when her summons came "to
go up higher," she was president
of the Tiger Island Catholic church,
which position she had filled for
nearly two years. Only the Sun
day before her death on Thursday,
she had gone several miles away
with her husband to assist in the
work of a neighboring church.
The workers in His vineyard will
miss her, but the harpers before
the throne of Him who doeth all
things well, will be reinforved. Oh,
what a shining example for chris
tians to imitate, is her beautiful life!
Sunshine and gladness followed in
her wake, and the strong in sin
gave way beforeher.
On Thursday, March 2sat, 189w,
at 3 o'clock p. m., her mission on
earth was fulfilled, and with but
little sickness or other warunin,
and with scarce a strutgglb she
psed over the river as a child
into sweet slumber.
The husband will sadly miss
those tender ministerings that have
nerved him for the battles of life
for fifteen years, his children will
weep thr loss of a tender parent
whose holy counsels were thelamps
on the pathway of their lives
friends and other relatives will
mourn the loss of a leader and her
loving service, but oh, who shall
measure the anguish of soul of that
lone daughter, who never knew
other parent? Who sought the
love of a mother not alone for it
Sself, but for the lack of father, a
brother, a sister, a child, and found
Sthat mother's love broad enough,
Sdeep unu full enough, and ten
derly  to estisfy the void for
all. Ah!io shalln measure the
I depth cher rgrt, and ll the ach
l.ug void of a bsting heart?
INo.e sve Him who caused it, sud
nay He in His love give that con
solation which bringeth paece
and fortitude and cour~e to bear
her up even unto that blessed meet
gwhen they shall pat no more.
