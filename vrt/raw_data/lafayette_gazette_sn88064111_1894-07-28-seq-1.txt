HE often sat to
~ Williot; he
liked her ex
pression and
the Italian
tone in her
color. More
over, he greir interested in her from
certain words and hints she let fall.
She was a devout Catholic, but ad
mitted she had not always been so.
One day Williot led her on step by
step to tell her story, and how she had
become devout. They were discussing
matrimony in the abstract, and she ap
peared so conversant with the law be
tween man and- wife that he asked
her how she knew it.
"How did I come to know the law?"
said she. "WVell, because you see I
was brought up behind the scenes
born in the property room of a provin
cial theater, and educated to emerge
graelully from pantomime pies or
gigantio rosebuds as a diminutive
fairy. With this refined birth and
training I learned many things not
generally imparted to children. At
any rate, very early I knew that a man
could legally chastise his wife, so long
as he never struck her with a stick
thicker than your little finger. I knew
this, 1 say, because I heard it explained
by the lawyers when my father was
sent to jail for having beaten my
mother with something a good deal
thicker than the prescribed dimensions
pertitted."
-Williot smiled and suggested that
that edifyiing spectacle had apparently
not deterred her from taking a hus
band herself.
"No," she answered. "and I was only
seventeen when I did marry."
"'How did that come about?"
"Because I was a self-willed young
fool, and I thought I loved the other
self-willed young fool, who was our
assistant scene painter. I was playing
general utility in the theater, and he
was painting general utility, as you
might call it."
"Did you love him then?" interposed
WVilliot.
"''Yes, I say so, but I got to hate him
as well. Love and hate seemed ever
to go hand in hand with me all through.
First one was uppermost, then the
other. A contradictory, violent-tem
pered young wretch I was. I neiver
tried to control my passions-I'd never
been taught. My mother always said
Thever had a heart; perhaps she was
right."
"Tell me, why did you hate your
husband?"
"Because I found he had a stronger
will than I had, and because he grew
to be more savage and morose as he got
on in his profession, oddly enough. Be
cause, too, he was as artful as he was
handsome; and he knew the law bet
ter than my father. lie never struck
me with a stick at all, thick or thin,
but once, and that once settled the
business, but I shall come to that pres
ently. Yes, he was a clever fellow,
too, in his art. lie gave up scene
painting and painted pictures instead
that sold at high prices. lie used to
make ine sit as his model often, and I
hated that more than anything. You
may wonder that I didn't run away
from him long before I did. The truth
is I was afraid of him. lie cowed the
very life out of me. At one time he
made a lot of money. but he couldn't
keep it, and finally we'had to go abroad
to avoid creditors.
"We went to Rome. and lived there
several years. In those days an artist
could live there very cheaply, as we
did, but still he got into debt again,
and for months he was afraid to show
himself by daylight. You can guess
how we carried on, and if you can't it
won't matter, and so, as I've told you
so much, I'll come to that last scene
between us, which, as I say, settled
the business. I seemed to be quick at
languages, and picked-up a good smat
tering of Italian, and being still pret
ty he made me sit as a model for other
painters in order sometimes to get
food, lie even went so far, and I
didn't mind, as to make me go and
wait in the Piazza di Spagna, on hire
with the native models. At first. they
were inclined to resent Sig. In
glese's intrusion on their domain, but
they were good-natured people, and
put up with me after awhile.
"He was in hiding kt that time, and
I had to go to and from home with the
greatest care, so as not to betray our
whereabouts. IMy training on the
stage, and then as a model, made me
pretty nimble at disguises and- wear
ing strange dresses, and when I wezt
on hire to the piazza.
"We lived in a curious half-ruined
place, part of what had once been the
chapel of a Benedictine monastery. We
hired it of a kindly old monk for a song,
but no one else lived in the building
-we were there quite alone. I forget
exactly where it was, but it was out
side the city, on the edge of the Cam
paegs. We had a small room *iere

ta .sote becnh: It was what he called
ia aasae bitt -ad he mnade a study
before the shrine with up-stretctad
arms and clasped hands in the attitude
of supplieation. The background was
all there to. his hand without stirring
out of doors, and I, of course, had to
sit or kneel as the praying wife. With
out exception it was the most trying,
tiring attitudq I had ever assumed.
Mly knees and back lost all sensation,
and the uplifted arms simply seemed to
go dead after half an hour. Why
didn't I rest? you will ask. Be
cause I daren't till he gave me leave.
The crosses of our fortunes had turned
him into a regular savage, and he was
at his worst while painting this pic
ture. For hours he kept me kneeling
there day after day. Once I grew
faint, but luckily just then he said:
'You can rest,' so he didn't know it.
Another time when my hands and arms
were all pins and needles, I pleaded
for a pause. He refused it. I went
on. Then I couldn't help saying a
little. He swore at me. I steadied
myself. At last, without any warning
or will of mine, my arms dropped on
my lap, and I fell forward, my chin on
the altar. With a big oath he rose
furious.
" 'You've ruined my work, you
devil!' he cried, 'just at a most critical
point, when I was finishing your left
hand. Up again instantly or I'll be
the death of you,' and he roughly
placed me in the old attitude.
"Ten minutes~ later the same thing
happened. I couldn't help it. Again
he rose, and this time he struck me
violently across the back and shoulders
witch his mahl stick, which was no
thicker than his finger. This was the
first time he'd ever struck me-badly as
he'd behaved, and it was the last. I
never loved him after that. No, kind
heaven never gave me the chance, for
after the blow I did faint, and when I
recovered I was lying where I fell. He
had not even lifted me f'om the
ground. No, but he had stretched
himself at full length upon the stone
bench, and was sound asleep.
"Escape was my first thought-re
venge the second-and as I stood up,
the second overwhelmed the first.
Noiselessly I crept to where lay, amidst
many studio properties, the brigand's
poignard. Often I had dreamt of this,
and had seen it glitter in my hand. but
in the dreams opportunity was want.

use them mercilessly. Night was com
ing on. I could escape under its cover.
Whither to fly, or how to live after,
wards, I gave these things no thought
as I stood with the weapon raised
above his naked throat. Did I lack
courage? No. sincerely no. What, then,
made me suddenly pause and listen?
Footsteps? Yes, faint and distant on
the road, running near our abode.
Alone, they would not have deterred
md. but above them rose upon the still
ness a chant-a chant from some re
ligious procession, pilgrims probably,
passing towards the city to do homage
at the shrine of the Holy Bambino in

Christmas Eve? The sounds came
nearer. Full. strong. melodious-deep
ly impressive.
"Stranger that I had ever been to
religion and its emotions, it was
odd how, when I came to Rome a faint
suggestion of something akin to them
had gradually stolen into my being. I
think the music in the churches did it,
and many times I would have gone in
to listen. perhaps to pray, had I known
how, and had I dared. lMy husband
was a scoffer.
"The singers approached until I could
almost hear some of the Latin words.
It seemed miraculous even to myself
that they should affect me as they
were doing. I strained my ears to
catch the prayer. Strange it wvould
have been at any moment that it should
have so fascinated me, but now most of
all strange when my blood was red
hot with fury and passion; and when
revenge for all my wrongs was lying
within my grasp! Was it intercession
from above, an intercession for his
life? It struck me so at the moment!
Only later did I see, perhaps, that it
was an intercession on my behalf also,
but at the time I never thought of this,
and I spared him. I paused no longer.
Turning my back resolutely on the
temptation, I stole away up the stairs.

"That night I sought the old monk,
our padrone, and told him my story.
He was moved, and said the Blessed
Virgin had performed a miracle and
had taken me to her bosom, heretic

to be saved. I now know he was
right.
"By his aid I concealed myself fromi

do so long. The saints, their names be

THEY, SEEK THEIR MEAT.
Pathetic Little Story of the Stubborn Lasn
by and the Hungry Eaglets.
The lamb stopped nursing, and the
ewe, moving forward two or three steps,
tried to persuade it to follow her. She
was anxious that it should as soon as
possible learn to walk freely, so they
might together rejoin the flock. She
felt that the open pasture was full of
dangers.
The lamb seemed afraid to take so
many steps. It shook its ears and
bleated pitcously. The mother returned
to its side. caressed it anew. pushed it
with her nose. and again moved away a
few feet. urging it to go with her.
Again the feeble little creature refused,
bleating loudly. At this moment.there
came a terrible hissing rush out of the
sky. and a great form fell upon the
lamb. T'he ewe wheeled and charged
madly; but at the same instant the
eagle, with two mighty buffetings of
his wings, rose beyond her reach and
oared away toward the mountain. The
lamb hung limp from his talons,-and
with piteous cries the ewe ran beneath,
gazing upward, and stumbling over hil
locks and juniper bushes.
In the nest of the eagles there was
content. The pain of their hunger ap
peased, the nestlings lay dozing in the
sun, the neck of one resting across the
back of the other. The triumphant
male sat erect upon his perch. staring
out over the splendid world that dis
played itself beneath him. Now and
again he half lifted his wings and
screamed joyously at the sun. The
mother bird, perched upon a limb on
the edge of the nest. busily rearranged
her plumage. At times she stooped her
head into the nest to utter over her
sleeping eaglets a soft chuckling noise,
which seemed to come from the ver3
bottom of her throat.
But hither and thither over the round
bleak hill wandered the ewe, calling
for her I1mb, unmindful of the flock
which had been moved to other pas
tures.-Charles G. D. Roberts, in Lip
pincott's._
Utility of Ship Model.
lMany of those elaborate models of
sailing ships npde by the sailors of all
seafaring nations and representing
often the occupation of hundreds of
leisure hours, find their way at last to
the shops of the dealers in junk or an
tiques. Their purchasers are frequent
ly artist· s and illustrators; who find in
these tiny but faithful reproductions of
great ships the best available models
for studio work. A perfect example of
the sort is sure to fetch a good price,
even at second hand. Some of the best
are made by Italians, because small
barks and full-rigged ships of moderate
tonnage are commoner to Italian cam
meree than to that of most other na
Stions, and it is the vessel with square
.a-lls and abunamat oerdage that lends
itself beat to the purposes of the t-ll
trator.-N. Y. Sauan.

As to grizzly bears," said a Montana
man one evening, recently, "as to griz
zly bears, we've got plenty of 'em left
in our country, but unless you are look
ing for them you might travel the trails
and byways for five years and not get
sight of old Ephriaiam. As big and sayv
age as they are they avoid mankind
when it's possible. I've heard "em mov

rode along a wild trail, but in fifteen
years I have had a-fair sight of only
one, and he was anxious to get away."
"How about the mountain lion?" was
asked.
"Ah; you've struck quite another
field now." he replied. The mountain
lion of the far west is not a lion at all.
as you probably know, but" I th'e beast
known in the east as the panther. I
think, however, the western panther
is larger and fiercer. At any rate. all
things considered, I'd prefer to face a
grizzly. "
"Ever had any experience?"
"Yes, just one, and it makes my hair
stand on end to think of it. I'm half
owner of a good, big herd of steers. but
I wouldn't go through that experience
again for a thousand of the fattest.
juiciest steers ever rounded up in the
cattle country. You want to hear
about it, but it's no use to get out your
book and pencil. My experience
was very brief, and there are no
names and dates to put down. Look on
the map some day and find Flat Head
lake. Between it and the Rocky moun
tains is a beay4iful valley thirty miles
wide. I've wintered cattle in there and
had them come out as fat as butter in
the spring."
"Yes, go on."
"One spring, eight or ten years ago,
I was driving in some 'strays' from the
foothills. When cattle begin to shed
their coats they like to get into the tim
ber and rub themselves. About ten
o'clock in the forenoon I was riding
along an Indian trail on the slope of a
hill. It was in the timber, with lots of
brush covering the ground. I saw cattle
tracks on the trail, and had no thought
for anything else. My mustang was
on the walk and I was taking it easy
in the saddle, when I was suddenly
jumped out of my boets. Something
screamed in my. ear, and out of the cor
ner of my eye I saw something in the
air. No doubt I ducked, but it was in
stinct. In the same breath there was
a great crash in the top of a brush to
my right and below me, and just as my
mustang started on a wild run I made
out what the object was."
"A mountain lion, sir?"
"Yes, and a whopping big one, and
the snarls, growls and screams he ut
tered rlifted me in my stirrups. lie
landed in that bush on his back, with
his legs sticking up like posts. but I
don't reckon it took him over five sec
onds to turn rightside up. lie may
have started to follow me, though he
was more apt to slink away. but the
mustang would have given him a hard
race. He was wild with fright, and the
way he did smoke along that trail and
get down into the valley would have
made a jack-rabbit wonder how the
wings were fastened on. I held on
and let him go. As a matter of fact,
he wasn't going fast enough for me."
"The lion had jumped for you."
"lie had, my boy. I -went up and
figured it out afterward. The beast
had crouched on a big rock eighteen
feet above me and about twenty-four
feet above the trail. Just how close he
came to me I can't say, but I'm cer
tain that he brushed my hat as he
passed over. The duck probably saved
my life. If he had struck me with the
momentum of such a spring I'd have
been carried out of the saddle into the
bushes. The cuss was lying low for
beef or deer. but when I came along he
thought he had a better thing. As he
missed me he turned over in the air.
and as I told you, he landed wrong-side
up. I don't know how mountain lions
feel about such things, but I've always
had the idea that this fellow wvent off
kicking himself over the way he got
left. He had overjumped a good dinner
and couldn't blame anybody but him

William Henry Bishop, in an article
on "Hunting an Abandoned Farm in
Upper New England," describes the de
lightful home of a literary man and his

passing hours. The young pro
prietor was a college man, and
had pursued for awhile some
city occupation; but he had taken to
farming out of pure love of it, and not
the worst severities of winter had been
able to daunt him. He hoed with his
men in planting time, pitched hay with
them in haying time, and lugged his
own heavy buckets of sap through the
snow in early spring, in maple-sugar
time. It was a vindication of the ideal,
a testimony to the world of actual,
hard physical labor, which, for us,
despite the disparagement of the indo

of it--is most desirable, a beautiful,
beneficent thing. We please to marvel
when a city person goes off heartily in

paradox is true, namely, that it is city
people who are precisely the best-fitted

JOINED IN THE LAUGH.
A Bow-legged Admiral Who Was Musander
stood by a Bulldog.
"Sailors, like horsemen, have a ten
dency to become bow-legged." said
Capt. S. Wooden, an ex-navy officer, re
cently. "1 once saw an old admiral,
whose long sea service had given his
legs a decided outward curvature, have
a singular adventure with a bulldog
that was a pet aboard ship. The sail
ors had taken great pains with the
dog's education and taught him a num
ber of tricks. One of his most fre
quent exploits was to jump through the
aperature made by the man holding
one of his feet against the other knee.
It was a trick that the dog seemed
take great delight in performing.
One day the admiral came on
board the ship on a visit of inspec
tion, and while standing on deck con
versing with some of the officers was
spied by the dog. The admiral's bow
legs seemed to strike the dog as afford
ing the best chance for a running leap
he had seen in many a day. Suddenly
he made a rush and leapt like a whirl
wind through the tempting gap. In
astonishment at what had passed be
neath him, the admiral turned quickly
around to see what was the cause. The
dog took this action as a signal for an
"encore" and jumped agtiin, barking
furiously all the time as a means of
showing how he much he enjoyed the
sport. The bewildered face of the ad
miral was too much for the gravity of
the spectators, and, forgetting the re
spect due to rank they broke into a
hearty roar, in wh ch, after he under
stood the situation, they were joined
by the admiral himself."-St. Louis

Cruelty to a Lion.
A lion tamer was brought into court
by the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals of London on the
charge of "cruelly beating, ill treating
and torturing a certain animal. to-wit,
a lion." Lions were in a cage wherein
a woman executed a serpentine dance,
and were whipped and irritated to a
state of bad temper to make them suffi
ciently wild to gratify the vulgar taste
of the public. The prosecution alleged
that the lion, being dependent on man
for food and sustenance and under his
dominion, could not be regarded as
ferae naturme. The lion tamer hustled
the lions about with a whip and a pole,
in order to give an excitement to the
lady's dance. The judgment of the
court was, that the lion could not be
made into a domestic animal within the
meaning of the act, and the lion tamer
was discharged.--Chicago Times.

panion. Even a verbal assault will
strain the temper of the mildest man,
and as for physical violence, why, that
takes the affair entirely beyond the re
sources of philosophy. All this being
axiomatic, it follows .that anyone who
takes the canine pet for a stroll in New
York city without either muzzle or
chain takes his temper in hand, and
wanders over a mine of anger that may
be sprung at any moment. For sooner
or later he will see a burly fellow
sweep down upon the pet, perhaps as
it runs between his very legs, and bear
it struggling away, tossing it ruthless
ly into the depths of the dismalest old
Black Maria that even New York can
boast. The man is an official licensed
"dog-catcher," the vehicle a sort of
ante-mortem hearse that every year
carries several thousand dogs on their
To ask you to keep your temper as
Ion see your pet engulfed in this omnl
1ns is of course quite useless. You
could not do it if you would. Still the
opposite procedure will avail yoh noth
ing. You can not stop the robber by
force, for he is probably much more
than your match to begin with, and
even if he were not, there are two or
three more of him in the wagon, be
sides which the law is altogether on
his side. You had best not try to coer
cion, therefore. But there is a far
stronger power in the community than
coercion, as you well know if you have
lived long in the metropolis. It is trac
tion. Try that if you like; but-mar
vel of marvels!-even that will proba
bly be ineffectual. Those catchers get
but forty cents for your dog, yet your
offer of a dollar each is declined. If
anything could come near convincing
you that you are dreaming, it is that
experience. Your anger turns to won
derment. What can it mean? Well,
some dog-catchers' licenses have been
revoked recently, and perhaps the pres
ent incorruptibles are fearful that they
might be served in the same way. Pos
sibly you look to them as if you
might "peach," and they do not
trust you. Or perhaps they do not trust
one another. If one were alone--well.
it might be different. Or again-strange
that this thought should come last
perhaps the catchers are conscientious.
At all events, as the matter stands, you
will never see your dog again unless
you go after him to the city dog-pound.
But, after all, you need not feel so
badly 'about it, for it is worth your
while to go there anyway. just out of
curiosity. Since you own a dog you
are, of course, a lover of dogs, and any
day you may find at the pound a strange
assortment of these animals. The ap
proach to the pound is not altogether
inviting. You go through a street bor
dered with fruit markets of not quite
the highest grade, where the venders
are jabbering in what sounds like Choc
taw, but probably is a species of gar
bled Italian. Coming to the East river,
you see a long, low building projecting
out over the water, supported, Lake
dweller fashion, on piles. The
sign "Dog-Pound" is over the door.
Entering, you find in charge a
man who does not seem to regard the
purloining of your dog at all the seri
ous matter you think it, but who an
swers you civilly enough and turns
you over to one of the uniformed dog
jailers, who escorts you into the prison
proper.
Such a din of bow-wows and howls
and yelps and so on throughout the
range of the canine vocabulary you
never heard before, not even at the dog
show. Three or four hundred dogs are
huddled together in two great cages. or
k pens. Big dogs and little dogs. black
and white and yellow and brindle dogs,
mastiffs and hounds and setters and
pugs and poodles, and-more than all
the rest-an assortment that are simply
dogs, with a question mark added at
this in some cases.
Some bound eagerly to greet you; oth
ers cower in the remotest corner. A few
I are bold and confident, a few angry and
morose, more are cowed and despond

the door in hope of seeing a friendly
I familiar face as you enter-a face that
*would be the most welcome sight in the
Sworld to each particular dog-that of
his master. Your own dog flies to you
and is rescued, and all the others give
3 a howl of disappointment, but many of
r them come to lick your hand and make
friends with one whom they recognized
as a lover of their race. Every dog of
them is yearning for sympathy. A poor
little King Charles cowering over there
in the corner, if he is not actually
weeping, is.surely wishing that that
Sprivilege were not denied his kind. for
he looks lachrymose enough. "Will
my mistress never come?" he seems to
say. And water-spaniels and poodles
say the same thing in pantomime. Even
the unintelligent eyes of the little pugs
have a despairing, wisitful look that
goes to your heart.-Harper's Weekly.
The Perfume of leweras.
SIt takes half a lifetime to learn how
Sto do anything perfectly. Few know
r how to inhale the perfume of a flower.
SThe idea should be to capture "the fine
Sfugitive first of all" aroma by the
t slightegt and most delicate possible in
Shalation. If you try to jam your nose
I down into the flowrr you lose the es
s sential attar and get a rank smell of
b petals or leaves, a very diferent thing
from the fragrance secreted by the
glands at the base of the stamens and
pistila.-Boston Transcript.
