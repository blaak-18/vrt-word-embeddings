ni:nc'd tl:ht .very attempt to fight it
tittu m the color line could but result
in disaster, and if persisted in would
end in the annihilation of the negro
rnec. Ie fnrthertnre warned his
friends that while a blind, unthinking
alliegiancC to thle Republican part ty
tmight he the means of that party's
triumpIh, it would bring no substan
tial advantage to the negro. lie said:
"'Gentlemen, the question with us
is not parties. It is not Republican
ism or Denlocracy, nor amin a Re
publican because I believe in the par
ty by its name. If the Democratic
party would accord to the colored
people all their rights as citizens be
fore the law, I would be Democratic
just as soon as I would le Republican.
'[Applause.] The trouble with us is,
the soluition of this vexed question of
race, and therefore, we must confine
t to the South. I heard last night in
our caucus a debate, which for ability,
I have not seen equaled in any coli
vention of our people, and rarely
equaled in convention of whites. And
in that debate one of the speakers
said that laws were nothing except
they had the support of the people.
Gentlemen, this is too true ; in other
words, you may enact all the laws
that you please; you may pass statute
after statute ; but as long as the maj
ority of the people are opposed to
these laws, no power on earth can
execute them. So then we may, by
an intelligent exercise of our right to
.ote, make a public sentiment that
i1 secure the te,en'frcemvtient of the
law. That is the pro;bleim we have
got to solve. Whether this conven
tion will be equal to the task or not,
Iknow not. But I think it can pave
the wal for a beginning. The clarion
.aote was sounded from the national
'capitol by Senator Bruce, of Missis
sippi, [applause] and the response lihe
fiiet with from every section of this
land demonstrated to me that the
black people had commenced to think
or themselves. Ever since the abo
lition of slavery somebody else has
been-thinking for us, and they have
not thought wisely. [Applauise.] I
say that Bruce's speech was the be
ginning of a new way ; and, if it has
the effect which I anticipate, all these
parties--demagogues to the contrary
-will solve the problem of harmony
.and mutali contfidence between the
races in this section of the country.
I mean to say one other word, and
then I am done. I remember a state
,ment made by Donuglas that the Re
publican party was a ship' to the col
ored mian, and Atl else sea. There
was a great deal of truth in that. It
was the party of -civil progress, it
was more in accord with the spirit of
the age. But is that true of the Re
publican party in the future f
In Louisiana, wherever the colored
,man has shownl a disposition to be
guided by his own convictions, an
incessant war has been carried on
against him, both inside and outside
the Republtcan party. We are not
only impoverished, not only bnarkrupt,
but worse--immeasurably worse. The
black people have lost all their nman
hood. To-day in that State' a set of
tricksters, a set of adventurers, man
ipulate the conventions to such an
extent that only those they please can.
get admnission to a cosuvention. If
they do not openly subscrlbe to
wrong, they will be counted out."
'rhcese utterances declare a new de
parture, and sound the death-knell
of carpet-ba;ggisni in tlIe South. Mur.
Pinchback's rcueimes, of course, will
say that lie has expressed the senti
Imneuts of a disappointed man; but
they will findl it easier to impugn
his motives than to refute his argu

IHE EUCALYPTU3 TREE!! ! In
An Exhaustive Account of its Pe- .
culiarProperties-Reasons for
the Increasing Popularity
of the Tree-Its re
markable Absorp
tion of Malaria. Si:
[From the San Francisco Evenlzng Bulletin.]
OWING to the constant inquiries from At
various portions of the Ilited States D
in regard to the Etcalyptus Globulons, or
Australian Gum Tree, we are inducced to
give a thorough description of it, em- ,
bracing manl:ty facts not hitherto pub- C
lished. Through the courtesy of Soun- ti
tagg & Co., of this city, we'have devoted 'e
much time to the cultivation of the tree,
we have ohtained most of the informa
tion here furnished. The Enralyptus is wi
extensively grown in California, where gli
probably no lesl than one mailion trees
arc planted. In this city, in frlont of lei
handsome residences, you will fincd it
with its magniiueent drooping branches, in
making an effective and graceful shade
tree. In Oakland the broad avenues are Di
lined with them. tit
In Algeria its cultivation was under
taken on a large scale. Sotme 13,000 En- N'
c:ilypti were pllanted in an extremely pcs- at
tilental and unhealthy section, were fever
preivailed to a great extent every year
Du'ing the first year of thelir growth, at *
the time wthent the fever scaon used toe
set inl, inot a single catse of feveir wce.lrred,
yet the trees were only unine fttt high.
Since thlen this place is reported free
froni its unwelcome vioitttitons.
In thie vicinity of Constantinoide, an
other fever spot. marshy and sickly, tlhe T
whole ground was dried up by L14.000 of
these trees. In Cuba marsh diseases are
rapidly disappearing upon thie introduc- I
tion of this tree. A railway statiot in
the Departmnent of Var wasso pestilenti;al it
that the officials could not remain there a
longer than a year. Forty of these trees j
were planted, and the unhealthy condi- P
tion of the, place was changed. ti
Two miles from Haywardl~ in this
State, tihe Surveyor General pultcd two -
grovesof thle Eicalypti!is, one of ahot
ninety teik narid the other seveity acres,
the whle comprising about 150,0t'0 trees.
They are now only about five years old,
yet many of the trees are forty to fifty 1
feet high. the whole making a most ex- 8
tensive and beautiful ftorest ; tfor fuel andl
timlbe.r piurposes being worth thousands
of dollars.
Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and
other Southern States are awakening to
the imnportance of plantig thiese trees,
and the same ulay he said of New Mexico.
Tlhese trees are propagated and for
