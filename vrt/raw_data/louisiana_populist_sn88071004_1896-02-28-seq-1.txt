No less absurd Ito the error of the individual

IS THIS OUR COUNTRY?
SOME OF IT IS, BUT VERY MUCH
OF 17 IS NOT.
The English Own m d Control 77,800.000
Acres, While the Corporatioas Own Near
ly or Quite !00,000,000 Aches, and Mi1
lions Do Not Own One Acre.
A London syndicate owhs 3,000,000
acres of land in one body in Texas.
This is equal to five full-sized counties.
There are two other English syndicates
and several English individuals who
own more land in Texas than any
American does or ever will own. One
English nobleman, Viscount Scully,
owns 3,000,000 acres in Illinois. The
1 Duchess of Marlborough, and others
connected with her, own 2,000,000 acres
in Florida. Another English syndicate
1 owns 1,800,000 acres in Mississippi.
Besides these English capitalists own
in this country about 68,000,000 acres of
land in the different states, and Amer
ican citizens,for the use of this land,or
any part of it, must pay these En
glishmen fgr the privilege. Most of
this land has been acquired in a few
years, and at the present rate of In
vestment, it will not be many years
before our people will be at the mercy
of English nobles for the privilege of
shelter apd the chance to till American
soil. Besides this, there has been
given to railroad corporations nearly
200,000,000 acres of land, most of which
is held, directly or indirectly, by for
eign money lenders. Foreigners also
own over $5,000,000,000 of national
state and corporation bonds, upon
which $200,000,000 annually in interest'
must be sent abroad. And still the
great hue and cry is that we must do
nothing to prevent foreign investments
in this country. It may be interesting
to estimate the time that will elapse
before foreigners will own the entire
country, and the people who are in it.
Is this realy our country? Or does it
not belong to foreign capitalists? At
least, do they not own "a controlling
interest" in it already? And what are
we going to do about it?-Dallas Farm
and Ranch.
"'Is this really our country?" Who
does actually control its destiny?
Reader, did you ever give the subject
a thought? Now why is it thus? Is it
not because of false theories,class laws,
laws and treaties that never should
have existed? This all comes about
through legislation of a most viecious
character. Congressmen prate about
tarif and quietly pass class laws, legis
lating In the interest of those who are
conscienceless, those who are pirates
by nature and practice, the uncrowned
royalty and American plutocracy. Yes,
they talk tariff,keep their hands behind
them, receiving "blandishments" and
vote away the rights and substance of
their constituents. Such has been the
practice of the leaders of the two old
parties since 1856.
Gold, greed, gain and gluttony-the
Cleveland-Sherman creed;
There is an over production only of
knaves and fools, politically.
Oh, for the wisdom and honesty of
a Solon among our oceeholders.
The South and West has supported
Eastern plutocracy long enough.

Uncle Sam's outlook for the future is
anything but reassuring. How long
before his children, the American peo
ple, will discover the real.cause of his
dejected mood and, recognizing the
situation from his present point of view,
resolve upon the only dignified course
Many an old Democratic bell weather
Is standing looking over the fence
(which is very low) into the Populist
pasture where the millions feed on
true reform.
The poor, imbecile leaders of the two
old parties want to talk tariff this fall.
Let them do so. The people know
what the issues are. Keep in the mid
die of the road.
The good people of the South and
'West should vote for their own inter
sets a while, having done the bidding
of Eastern usurpers and bondholders
for thirty years.
The premial action of the state dem
ocracy has not produced harmony, but
on the contrary has had a tendency
to bifurcate the party. "Let her go,
Megarden," all is ready.
From. the lights before us, it seems
that it has cost the people $262,000,000
to kill the Democratic party. Mr.
Cleveland is a master hand at disorgan
isation and destruction.
Few, very fetw, ever reach the isle of
Fortune, and year by year class legis
lation makes it more difficult for the
many to reach that favored spot, or
even the valley of Comfort.
There is more fraud in the one word
"parity," as applied to money, than in
any other word, except perhaps, "re
deemable," and the fact that law makes
money proves the assertion.
Let our speakers challenge every old
party speaker to show them when,
where and through what old organiza
ti.e, religious or political, any sigif-,
cant reform was brought about.
It only took forty-eight hours for
congress to pass the anti-prisefight bill
and for the president to sign it. They
could give this country relief if they
would, but the bankers say no.
It is noticeable and praiseworthy
that Populists, unlike the Democrats,
and Republicans, are not worrying
about their candidate-it is principles
that engross their best thought..
Dr. Grover Cleveland's "gold cure"
has killed the Democratic party. An
individual, corporation or government
that goes in debt when there is no
necessity for doing so, is ruined.
If you have a club at your voting box
keep it up. If notorganile one at once.
Organisation is our safeguard. Re
formers must get together and stick to
eash other all the way through.
Conaresmen seem to have "it in" for
Secretary Morton in good style, He re
ased to buy seed for them to dis

one friend anyhow, Mr. Cleveland.
In some parts of this nation an hon

itrlets take "blandishments" right
along, and this is our greatest danger.

vember, 1896.-From the Chicago Na
tional Bimetallist.
A correspondent writes and asks
the Dallas News how many bonds
have been issued since 1860 by the fed
eral government,and the editor replies:
In the last two years Cleveland Dem
ocracy has spent $262,000,000 trying to
keep up the parity idea, but. between
what no one knows. Gold is being
drawn out of the .treasury to pay for
the last $100,000,000 bonds, and so it
goes.
The Hardy-Clark-goldbug crowd
have determined to "stay in the party"
and the free silver Democrats are
doomed to defeat. I heir only hope is
to join the People's party; then we can
smite them hip and thigh-rout them
absolutely.
The voter is supposed to be the man
with the power in a democratic country,
says the Dallas News. Yes, but where
is t-h-e democratic country? Officers
elected In'this country do not obey the
people, but do as they please. ILook at
Cleveland and congress, will you?
Congressman Hall, Democrat, of Mis
souri, elected by the reformers in his
party, has turned cuckoo,and will work
and vote for the gold standard. Now
watch and see if he don't get a good job.
He knows he can never go to congress
any more from Missouri. Oh! the dad
gasted measely politicians!
Cleveland's Monroe doctrine message
was a dodge to attraot public attention
from the schemes of the bankers and
the bond swindle. That was all. Patriot

the smallest type In future. It seems
to be a back number. Partisan preju
