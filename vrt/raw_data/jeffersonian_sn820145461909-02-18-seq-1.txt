Summary of Tbents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
Again the Misinformed. President.
In siding with the interested manu
facturers of food products against Dr.
Wiley, head of the Bureau of Chem
istry, another victory is scored for
profits against public welfare. True,
this victory was won through the
agency of a chemical board known
as the Remsen referee, * but the
result is a body-blow at pure food
laws. The point under debate was
whether or not the common preserva
tive, benzoate of soda, was injurious
to health in the quantities usually em
ployed and the decision was such as
will sustain the manufacturers on the
continued use of the drug and a host
of other chemicals under the free
dom they will assume is now giv
en to them. It is entirely true that
many of these preservatives are non
poisonous. Large quantities could be
consumed without toxic results. But
the fact well known to even the school
children is that the process of diges
tion is fermentative; and an agent
which is designed to prevent ferment
ative changes in canned foods, will al
so prevent their proper digestion when
they are consumed. Agents which tend
to produce dyspepsia and its attend
ant train of physical ills are harmful
and Dr. Wiley has been wise in his
rulings against them. It is unfortu
nate that a physician so capable has
been reversed in his decisions. Dr.
Wiley knows that the poor necessarily
have to take the canned goods of the
shop. They habitually consume large
quantities and the introduction of
benzoate of soda, the use of nitrogen
peroxide in bleaching flour and all such
things are definitely wrong.
The Proper Course.
Governor Marshall, of Indiana, has
discountenanced the proposal to build
an “executive mansion” in that state
to cost $150,000. He said, simply
enough, that it would take a very rich
governor to maintain a $150,000 resi
dence and that the idea was not in ac
cordance with Democratic simplicity.
The Guillotine.
After many years wherein capital
punishment was not employed, France
lately returned to the use of that hid
eous instrument, the guillotine. Both
President Fallieres and Minister Cle
menceau opposed it, the latter vigor
ously, but public sentiment against a
certain gang of murderers and rob
bers made the people clamorous for
drastic punishment. “If France wants
blood, she shall have blood,” was their
answer in effect. The gruesome scenes
enacted at the executions bring back
all the ferocity and mad exultation at
executions typical of the Reign of Ter
ror and the country is horrified at the
A Weekly Taper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
result of the executions upon the spec
tators. If the incident does not lead
to the abolition of capital punishment
altogether, it will doubtless insure a
decent privacy hereafter, should the
guillotine be called into requisition.
The Dis-employed.
Some one has objected to the term
“unemployed” as not conveying the
right meaning. A man may choose to
be unemployed, but when he is thrown
out of work through no fault of his
own, it is a disemployment, an en
forced idleness. Statistics just re
ported from New York State throw
light on this question that will cause
one to pause in very consternation.
Talk about the panic of 1907 in the
face of this!
“Not in a dozen years have the per
centages of idleness in the third quar
ter been much over half as high as in
1908.”
Prosperity is here, but —
The unskilled laborer doesn’t know
it.
The skilled trades union organiza
tions in 1908 in one State alone lost
26,000 men, so the skilled artisan does
n’t know it,
And the farmer can’t seem to find it
out.
Who, then, is enjoying this lovely
“return of confidence” and “pros
perity ’ ’ ?
The bread lines lengthen with
starvelings and men stand hours in
line for a job of snow-shoveling in the
big cities. Throughout the country
the pinch is still extreme. Os course,
we have the quadrennial upsetment of
“business’ due to the presidential

election, we say. But how about Ger
many, and England, where conditions
are as bad as they are here?
The fact is simply that the people
haven’t gotten down to accepting want
as their daily portion. The time is
approaching when the condition of
penury prevalent in “panic” times
will be normal. The industrial en
slavement is fixed upon the laborers
of the world like a vice, and each year
sees the screws turned a little tighter.
Outcome of California Legislature.
It is regrettable to note that the
legislature of California allowed itself
to be coerced into an almost immediate
reversal of itself at the instance of
Federal pressure, as represented by
the over-anxious Mr. Roosevelt. Even
the Act to segregate the children of
the races in the public schools failed
to go through, nor was the question al
lowed to come before the people of
California on general ballot. The
President in one of his messages to
the Governor of California loftily
states that “the policy of the Admin
istration is to combine the maximum
of efficiency in achieving the real ob
ject which the people of the Pacific
Coast have at heart.” It is the real
object, then, of Californians to be
conciliators of the Orient for the ben
efit of —whom?
Clearly, of those interested in Ori
ental trade. There may be something
in Mr. Roosevelt’s desire to provoke
no altercation with Japan when his
administration is just closing. Other
than this, a “war scare” is either
ridiculous or cowardly.
Very interesting, if he is posted,
are some of the statements of Con
gressman Everis A. Hayes, of Cali
fornia, who is quoted as saying:
‘‘We are maintaining friendly rela
tions with Japan by spoiling her. Had
we passed a Japanese exclusion law
tlnee years ago there would have been
comparatively little opposition on the
part of Japan to what there would be
it we passed one now. It will be
much harder three years hence.
“The most remarkable part of all
this controversy is that the rights the
Japanese are so loudly demanding in
this country are not given to any for
eigner in Japan. Americans are not
allowed to enter the schools of Japan;
they can not own real estate or en
gage in mining there.
“It has been asserted from the
highest authority that Japan is keep
ing faith in her promise to keep her
laboring people away from the United
States. Two years ago she promised
this, and yet during that year more
than 20,000 Japanese, practically all
laborers, landed upon the Pacific coast
of the United States. Last year more
than 15,000 landed; besides this, thou
sands have been landing in Mexico
and Canada, and coming over the bor
ders into the United States.”
The Crum Case.
There seems to be an eager willing
ness to allow Mr. Taft to take over
the Crum appointment, among the
rest of the “unfinished business” that
will be left by the Sixty-first.
“The Lincoln Way.”
Plans are under consideration for
memorial highway from Washington
to Gettysburg memorial to Abra
ham Lincoln, the way to become the
site of monuments to the soldiers of
the Civil War.
Earthquake Shocks General.
Mt. Colima, in Mexico, threatens
active eruption and earthquake shocks
have been felt in many parts of that
country. The south of Spain has also
been visited by shocks, and Sicily and
Southern Italy have been shaken
again.
Jury at Last.
After dragging through a month
and rejected at least 2,000 men, a
jury has finally been obtained in the
trial of the Coopers in Tennessee.
MAIL ROBBERIES.
Several cases of robbery of the
mails have been brought to our at
tention lately, and we must ask our
subscribers not to send money in un
registered letters. Send money or
ders, stamps or checks. If you send*
bills, register your letter.
