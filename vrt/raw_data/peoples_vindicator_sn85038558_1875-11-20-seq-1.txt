All He W nts is Time.
[From the XN. 0. Times.
Myers is a remnarkalde.,rman. We`
allude to My.Crs oft Natchitelhes.
Give Myers time annd there are few,
if any, thinlgs witiihi the range of
human possibility :tha he cannot do.
Our readers will probably recollect
that about a year and a half ago there
was a painful,rnoumr current touching
Myers. M'ers wlas then a Judge-a
District Judge; nict the sort of a Dis
trict Judge that Shannon wants to he,
but ype for which lm0',was just about
as fit as Shannon is for the place t.
hanlke'rs after. But we digress. My.'
yets 'was At that time '' District Judge,
anldithere was am unpleasant'rumor.
The rumor said that;,during Myer's
s5ervuie at thle 'ar', Scho.a l Board le
had improved the shini'l hours as it
were, to the exteit of gobblii rsome
tea thousand dollia r'e li' lbflir
money. Myers was busy,.then, and
he paid no atteutiun to thp injurious
gossip. He was a Judge, as we have
expained, aid, beside that, he had
very pressing business of a personal:
qature outside of Natchitoches piare
ish. Myers found it necessary to., te
to this city, in fact, and, as a comnle
queuee, had n6 leisure to atttend to
this cruel, though ridiculous story of
the $10,000 school ffmds. Neither
was Myers any better off as to time
further along inthei year. As late as
January, of 1875, one cold and gloomy
night, we find him appearing to poor
little Phil. Sheridan as a, refugee
from home and friends, a scared andl
Laggard martyr, a hairbreadth sal.
vage fion the assassins of the swamp.
Myers had then been living quietly
in New Orleans for almoat six months,
but Sheridan knew no better, and the
story hlad the pleasing effct of show
ing him off asa political victim rather
than a fugitive Treasury grabber.
Oh1, yes; Myers was very busy ion
those days. People accused him .of
Iseidling the school fund with qu a
word of denial befing heard. I be
came public opinaon and eom ods
mnor, and though,. Myers was: helre
in townu wih no visible occupltiws,
save that of giviug ghastly ' iertiuuy
before the Hoar Committee; neither
lhe nor the Organ -ever found time to
notice the injurious accusaeution .Why,
we almost began to believe that dis.
agreeable story' about the ten thous
anid dollars.
But as we said before, Myers "o a
remarkable man. We dM dot; tlih,
truly as we appreciated him, f$f~aV.
the resources of his great nature. We
little imagined whatt iyers' could and
ronuld do as soon as lie got time. We
little suspected that after the burdens
of statesmanship were lifted from My.
yers' shoulders, and after the excite
meu t of tllhne tremendous episodes
had subsided in Myers' midriff, and
at a time *heu everybody had given
up 'the $10,000 for lost-we little
dreamed, we any, that under sunch cir
cumstances Myers would some day
iile forward and. say, "Gents, you
unisulidestool me i" I did notbag
thlt $10,000., Here is Brown'scer
tifiette. You know Brown ; nice
man, Brown ; S perintendent of 'Pub
lic Education, you know. Well,
here's Brown's certificate dated' a
whole year and ahalf 'after the tran
sactionu, showing:thait I'gave up the
money like a inmll ,and brother.". We
were not prepared for this, eveq from
Myers, and -yet this is uilt W*hail hb
has done. Myers lae conie4fo.r ard
and shown on Brown's t4atjmoy, tiat
lhe did tiot steal, or at least dill' inot
keep the $IlO,00J of sChMsl:'itiiney
thalt disappeared so nytetijpdly oI
tihe spriug of 1874. Aid Inybmody
wiio wiuits to believe 'Brown hnd My.v
er, can do so witholuat aioleitalion.
That's the best of it,! Oh, <et!4iilly,'
Myers is a relmnarl~able luiau. Qjve
Myers timue :and'~ ~6 asks nothing

much. . Talme is all ie, waste.; aive

Tie Louisianian of the 6th instant,
" 'mps a iM- a eonvention of
the . de l rtg negroes of the State to
uieet in N'ew Orleans on Monday, sne
22d Instant, for the purpose of devia
ing seans by which the plan o suc
cessfully carried out in Mississippi,
this fall, of intimidating the colored
tote, will be prevented in Louisiana
in 1876. Of its plan, the Louisianian'
says:
.There are several ways by which
we can prptect our right) and interests
in Lofuisuna; but we have no time
to loose; we must put oar house in
order at once., In order to allay the
fears of the weak slid timid, we will
say, neither a "war of races" nor a
"blackian's party" is contemplated;
weapons more jaoteat and effeient are
at our hands; all that is required is a
united and steady purpose on the
part of our leaders, to the end that
we may utilise the means at our com
mand, and realize our own strength.
This is just as we wduld have it.
We ar futally satisfied in our own
minds that the assue in Louisiana s,
thle race issue; and we desire that
the negro ehilef shall rally their peo
ple on thatline .buthat odr·awnlpeo;
jre may h"e' their eyes fully open
_ed. The pegro leaders are .ternally,
talking about their race being intimi
dated, when tid black rapeals know
that if a negro desires to vote the
Demlteri·tid ticket, . he i bullied,
threatene4od stricised by his fel
lows. This systemr was practiced in
this-State in 1874 to a great extent,
and many negroes who voted' the
whiteman's ticket had to be-protect
ed against negro violence by the
wvhites. At the same time, Merrill's
cowboys were riding in gangs through
North Louisiana impriouiug, band
cullg and driving to the woods white
mune to. prevent them fiom taking
part Ia the election. The black chiefs
and the white thieves who are their
allies are a pretty set of'fellows to
be taclkHg about coneerting measures
to prevent the whites of Louisiana
from intimidating negroes in 1876.'
We know not exactly what their
seeeme is; but, be it what it t.ay,
when 1876 comnle, they u ill flind'that
Louisiana will gojuatexactly as Mis
sitsipipi has gone, atnd that they will
do wide to drop. their little plans to
prolong f dAir of rascality and ruin
in the 8tte. We desire, however,
that the aegrees shall hold this, con
vention; it will show our people the
absolute' necessity of organizatuon
and harmony of action.--Shreveport

Southern vs. Northern Grain

. We find quite aerimoniosl diiscu!
sinus goiung on ill oult Soullthernl farni
journals in relatitn to the reltive
value of Nottl'ernl or Western anld
purely Southern grain seeds. WI
find, too, as advocated in this plper
time and again, that the practical ex
per'inllce 'of intelligent plante'rs shKow,
ill their many commununications ena the
subject to various papers, that3iouthl
ern grown wheat, rye, ots and bar
ley are far preferable for seed to that
orf Northern growth. The controver
sy seemas, to be almost altogether b.
tween practical 'farmers who give
their experience for years, and wer

tural papers, who either ftrom inter-

iuvar'iably agree that eewd for small
grain should be obtained from us near
home as possible, or 'at least from
some adjoining State, while sowsme of
the theoretical writers contend that
improved Northoern seeds are much
the bear. We are glad to seM the
discussion going on. Our experience,
observation and judgmeut eause us to
side with the fa trner in this costro

tisements as to the superiority of
their nset.
Our rule to set on is, that one well
sustained, andouhbed fact is worth a

truth, no matter who is hurt by it.
