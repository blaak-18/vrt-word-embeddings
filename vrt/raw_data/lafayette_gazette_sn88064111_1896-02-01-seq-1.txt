OSCARING AUNT ABBIE.
-lr J. L. isARBOUl. 1
l ISS ABBTE TRABSK i
wan a short, bnst= c
ling little elderly
Swvniali with a de- t
.,, termined air, and '
r- was known to pos- f
sess great force of i
character. She I
was visiting at her brother's house in
the country, and had been unwise 1
enough to boast, in the pretence of her
two nephews, Bert and Lawrence, that
she "wasn't afraid of anything." And
now Bert and Lawrence intended to put
her courage to a test.
This was with her full knowledge;
.he had said that they might do so if
they were willing to suffer the conse
quences. They, had laughed heartily
at this, and declared themselves quite
V willing to run all risks.
Aunt Abbie's list of brave deeds in
eluded an actual encounter with a bur
glar found under her bed. She had on
this occasion produced a little pocket
pistol from her bureau drawer and kept
the man a prisoner under the bed until
help came in response to her calls, and
I he was captured. So the boys gave up
trying to hide under her bed and pre
tend that they were burglars.
She had once killed a large rattle
snake at a picnic, when every other
woman present was screaming or faint- r
ing. Snakes were therefore of no use. It
Moreover, she would go long dis- 9s
tances alone on the darkest night; she
would go down cellar or up into the -
attic at midnight without a light and "
without fear. She had been known to es
walk through a burying ground alone
at 12 o'clock on a dark and stormy ti
night. la
She had once slept alone in a house no
which was reported to be haunted, and b
had come forth in the morning declar- tI
ing that she had "slept like a top." bi
She was not afraid even of a mouse.
I:ert and Lawrence felt that they would L
have to exercise all their ingenuity to ai
get up anything that would startle ki
Aunt Abbie.
But at last they hit upon a plan. hi
Their aunt had lived all of her life in a q'
city, seldom visiting the country. She
!,new almost nothing at all about coun- hi
try sports. Some grotesque thing that in
she had never seen might frighten her. di
It was in the fall of the year, and fr
BIert and Lawrence finally decided to
try the effect of a "pumpkin ghost" ej
on Miss Abbie. A "pumpkin ghost," hi
sometimes called a jack-o'-lantern, is a
pumpkin hollowed out, with holes to "
represent eyes, nose and a grinning Be
mouth cut in one side of it. When a
lighted candle is placed inside a pump- OV
kin cut in this way, and the pumpkin is
fastened to the end of a long pole, the
eltect is startling enough on a dark M
night. nc
And the night was s "dark as a stack
of black cats" when Bert and Lawrenqe at
prepared to sally forth with their
pumpkin ghost. They proposed to
hoist it before Miss Abbie's window,
and then make all sorts of dismal Al
noises. They were quite sure she had

never seen a pumpkin ghost, and prob- pri
ably she had never heard of one. on
They slyly got the pumpkin ready ha
in the bern in the afternoon. In the the
evening they went to their room, and d'
ostensibly to bed, as usual, t half-past
ine. No one in the house knew of the
thLeir plan but theanmselves, and they pro- l
posed to slip out of their room and out
of the house without arousing anrne.
The roof of a shed kitehen sloped li
frhn the *tldow-sllls of their room to p
witahz. abo n ifse ~eet of the ground. yo
They .deeided to elianb quietly out of a roO
window, silip down over the kitchen
roof.to the mevesa, and dro lIghtly to the -
iou*. en t;y-', ,A , get the tha
- -4?~~Be --rh orl
feet wa ts tianit'y the pumpliii; taild
tae ihtedcled to wrap himself in it litiOh
frOin his bed to add to the frightfulness
of his appearance. Lawrence was to Ut
most of the groaning; but in -the li~a
M one groaned about he thitch ais the
other.
The night was very dark and unusual
ly cold, even for late October. It had
rained a little early in the evening, and
the kitchen roof was wet. Bert and
Lawrence shivered as they climbed olat;
one behind the other tfully dressed,
Bert et-rrying his sheet rolled up under
his coat. They shivered more and more
the longer they stayed out.
Bert was in advance of Lawrence
when they climbed out upon the roof.
No sooner were they fairly on the wet
and almost icy roof than they began to
slide down much faster than they had
expected or desired, and they -found it
impossible to slacken their speed or to
lessen the noise they were Ihakitfg iit
their hurried,'sdtinevhat rolling de
scent.
Down they slid, vainly grasping at
the roof or trying to stay their progress
by bracing their heels on the shingles.
It was of no avail .
"Look out for the rhin-water barrel,'
shrilly Whispered Lawrence, when they
were within three feet of the edge of the
roof.
But it was too late to look out for any
danger. Under the eaves was a huge
barrel, or tank, set to catch rain water.
It partly took the place of a Cestert,
C sihee it was large enough to hold seV
eral -rdinary bihrrels of water.
y It was also quite large enough to hold
three or four boys the size of the two
I Trask boys; and now, although it was
full of icy water to the very top hoop,
f it wqs suddenly called upon to receive
e Bert and Lawrence within its depths.
D 1own they c;tme, Bhert shooting swift
e ly over the edge of the roof and Law
r
"IT'S -OLY-LU- I"
rence sliding as swiftly after him. Both
landed with mighty splashes and loud
screeches in the tank of water!
Bert struck in a sitting position and
went down entirely beneath the water,
while Lawrence went in only up to his
ears.
The ground sloped a little away from
the tank; and, as the boys had both
landed heavily on the side of the tank
next to the slope, they overthrew the
big receptacle and were swept out on
the ground in one mighty wave that
buried them beneath it for an instant.
All this made a great deal of noise.
Lights appeared suddenly in the house
and Mr. Trask came quickly to the
kitchen door.
"Who's that? WVhat's the trouble out
here?" he asked, sharply. "Answer me
quickly, or I'll shoot!"
His wife and Aunt Abbie stood be- !
hind him, holding lamps and wrapped I
in bedclothes and peering out into the
darkness. Aunt Abbie really looked i
frightened.
"It's--only-us!" gasped Bert, still
ejecting water from his mouth, while
his teeth chattered.
"'Us!' repeated Mr. Trask. "Well.
who's 'us?' and what-why, if it isn't I
Bert and Lawrence!" f
"Why, they are dripping wet all c
over!" cried Mrs. Trask.
"Why, boys!" exclaimed Aunt Abbie. a
"What does it all mean ?" demanded I
Mr. Trask, in a tone that admitted of
nothing but the simple truth in reply.
"WVhy-we-we-wanted to scare- I
auntie," said Lawrence,with chattering t
teeth, "and we fell into the rain water I
barrel!"
"Wanted to scare me?" cried Aunt t
Abbie. "Well, that's a great way to do ii
it-to go to plunging into a tank of ice- r
cold water with your clothes on at al- t
most midnight. But I am scared- 3
scared 'most to death lest you take a b
dreadful cold! Get out of those wet
clothes and into bed just as soon as a
ever you can, while I mix you up a hot a
drink. Wanted to scare me! Humph!" t
"But we did scare you, after all," said j
the boys; and to this assertion they a
clung ever afterward.-Youth's Com- t
panion.

The popularity of self-colored cloth 1
dresses remains unimpaired, and it is
no wonder, since the material lends it
self to most kinds of trimming, and is
always in excellent taste.
A becoming costume has a very full
h plaited front, with collar of white chif
d fon, and an ecru sailor collar, with very
broad squared ends, and bands of ecru
on either side of the- pelisse, which
seem like a continuance of the collar.

SThe requeamcy of E3arthquakes.
In the "Memoires" of the Russian Ge
ographical society has just been pub- t
lished an important catalogue of earth- t
Squakes that have occurred in China, n
Siberia, Central Asia and Russia, and
- other places. The catalogue contains
Sa list of 'about 2,400 separate earth
quakes, which occurred in 560 different c
localities, from 596 B. C. till A. D. 18687. o
Out of them, 710 took place in China,
549 in East Siberia, 36 in West Siberia,
202 in Central Asia, 590 in Caucasia, 121
in Asia Minor and North Persia, and
188 in Europeain Russia. The frequeney
of earthquakes may be represented as
having been 640 in each 100 years in
Caucasia, 310 in China, 290 in East Si- as
beria and Turkestan, 138 in Middle and jo
South Russia, and 18 only in North th
Russia, Finland and the Baltic prov- Cl
inaees. As to their frequency during m
the diRfferent seasons of the year, the m
figures show that, while in Siberia and efl
Central Asia earthquakes are more fre- br
quent in autumn and winter than in at
spring and summer, the proportion is fe:

"s "The Arrow." The following is an ab
ie stract of the lecture: "He believes the

r stimulus of a plowed-up arrowhead,
Id and at a time when modern students
a were ignorant of the manner in which
e- this was done by aboriginal races. The
finer flaking and finishian with a flat
it piece. ot bone oi horn was with fim an
it aeidldental discovery, as he believes t to
"y have been with piiiitlte peoples.. He

Sling, as the 2tiitil say. - 'Phe shafts were
d always worked out froni btttttotip, that
,r they might fly in the right direction.
f If not from green material, they were
d well soaked before being straightened
,f by passing them through a hole of prop
er size in a wooden block. Then the
e shafts were grooved down to the feath
ers, with the tooth of a panther if in
tended for wiar, but with that of an elk
or beaver if for the chase. Finally they
were notched for the cord, and 'footed'
with a plug of wood to prevent splitting
on the cord when drawn. The three
r feathers, two lateral 'wings,' and a
third called the 'tail,' were attached by
chewed sinews wound about the shaft.
. After a bundle had been thus completed
they were dropped together upon the
I ground to determine their respective
regions. Accordingly as they pointed,
they were seprated into groups for the
four points of the compass, the mem
bers of each group being indicated by
e the peculiar cutting of the 'tail' feather.
d Thoep of the north and west groups
werenlestined for war, and those of the
south' and east for hunting, and they
were fitted with heads corresponding
to these uses. .The speaker traced the
gradual steps in the progress of the rase
in flaking flints and attaching them to
shafts. lie thinks that the feathers
were first attached through a fetichistic
belief in their power to aid the flight of
the arrow, and that the discovery of
their real serviceableness in this respect
when attached in a definite way at the
lease of the shaft came later. In con
clusion, the development of the bow
from the throwing stick, at a much later
period, was traced."--Boston Tran

' WATER AND GOLD.
e The Blmple Process by Which Mllilons of
Dollars Are Annually Galned.
It is not generally known, even in
Caliornia, that millions of dollars are
annualy taken from rude heaps of base
looking quartz by the flowing of water
over huge piles of broken r6cks that
contain th precious metal. The proc
ess of robbing the earth of its gold has
now been reduced to such a fine point
that the gentle flowing of water over
the ore gleans it of its golden treasures,
and this works well in cases where the
old chloride and other methods are not
so useful.
n waters by miners in bringing
gold' .f s of mineral-bearing
quartz is c d with a simple chemi
cal, whife fhe potency to dissolve
gold and hold it in solution. The spark
ling liquid, which flows over hundreds
of tons of quartz, trickles through the
mines and seeks its level, laden with
gold, is charged with a deadly poison,
cyandine of potassium, a drug which
ferrets out the minutest particles of the
yellowish metal, and dissolves them
and brings the precious burden to the
vats for conversion into refined gold
again.
The cyanide process is as noiseless C
and unerring as the laws of gravita
tion. The method is based on the fact
that even a very weak solution of cya
nide of potassium dissolves gold and sil
ver, forming, respectively, auro-pot
assic cyanide and argento-potassic cya
nide. The solution is separated from e
the solid material, and the gold and sill
ver are precipitated in metallic form.
During the last five years the process
has been introduced into almost every
gold field in California and elsewhere,
and more than $20,000,000 has been re
covered by the gentle flowing of waters
charged with the magical chemical. 1
Precipitation is effected by the us /if
fine pieces of zinc, so arranged that
when the rich waters flow over them
the fine gold clusters in rich deposits
over the zinc, for which it has Man
affinity. The gold deposits itself in
the form of fine dust on the plates of
zinc---Ioston Journal of Commerce.

It was a remark of Mendelsbahn that
there are two subjects which are too
sacred for discussion-religion and
thorough-bass. Religion and music are
not only alike sacred, but they touch at
so many points that they can hardly be
separated, and in their higher ranges
they melt into one. There are debased
forms of music that have no suggeution
of religion, and there are debased re- m
ligions that do not call for music; but
when each is worthy of its nasme they
pass into each other as by creative -
asinity.--T. T. Munger, in Century.
