INEQUITABLE ASSESS
MElNTS.
Baton Rouge Advocate.
Discussing certain allegations
lodged against the method of assess
ing property in the city of New Or
leans the Times-Democrat of a re
cent date says:
,"It is the rich and well-to-do, of
course, who are under-assessed; and
the fact that, through some means
or other, they escape paying their
proper share of taxation, defrauds 1
the city government of a material
portiotn of the revenue which it
would gather in. It is owing to
this default that the city is unable
to find money enough to support an
adequate police force for the pro
.tection of person and property, to
keep the schools open for the full f
period of the scholastic year, to
maintain charitable institutions, to a
pave the streets, and other munici- t
pal needs of importance to the t
city's welfare."
Thus it is shown that the admin- is
istration of the affairs of the munic
ipal government is seriously em
barrassed by the fact that the rich a
and influential people in that city I
are enabled to evade the payment r
of their pro rata towards the main- s
tenance of the burdens of the gov
ernment, while the small property
holders, whose all is in their home
and their stock-which cannot be
hidden from the scrutiny of the as
sessor-is taxed to the utmost limit. E
It follows also that if the city is si
thus defrauded of her just and law- f
ful revenues by this selfish, unequal t
and dishonest method of assessment C
the State must also suffer from the I
same cause, and to this extent 1l
therefore it is a matter in which the
whole State has a vital interest. S
Heretofore the cry has gone up L
from New Orleans to the effect that
property in that city was over-as
sessed, and the complaint has been
made that the country parishes were
escaping their just proportion of
the burdens of government by a
scandalously low rate of assessment.
We have always been quite ready a,
to admit, and we have admitted m
that gross inequalities in assess
ments exist in the country parishes ,
of the State; we have time and
again made complaint to the effect
that while the large planter and the M
man of extensive resources in the
country is gLnerally enabled to T
escape with a two-thirds, and often L
with a half, valuation of his R
property, the man who only has his L
"forty acres and a mule" is screwed K
up to the utmost limit, his property g
being assessed for more than it L
would bring in open market. This
fact has otten been recognized by
the country assessors themselves, xl
who have striven up to this time in
vain, to find some method byA
which to overcome the obstacles L
standing in the way of the just and U
equitable assessments in their L
respective parishes.
According to the statement which
we reproduce from the Times- c
Democrat this morning, however, G
the inequalities in the New Orleans L
assessments must be much more
glaring and at the same time more I.
burdensome to the people of the
State than are the assessments in
the country parishes. Save in the T
case of a limited number in the I'
sugar parishes, a man in the coun- T
try is accounted wealthy if he owns T
property to the real value of $Zo,- T
ooo. Here and there may be found
Sramn who may have property in
,ulki of this sum, but the great
:·diL f the country people consider
:themselves to be "comfortably
fixed" if they are able to boast of
--property valued at $i,ooo. In this H
K.city, according to the Times-Demo
--t'e;admission, it has not been an
-" amonmion occurrence for a busi
bias to have $2o,ooo or $2o,- s*
oked off his assessment and, -
if-'vw are to credit the charges made
by the T.-D., the correctness of
which we have no reason to dispute,
m many of these deductions have been
unjustly made, to the great detri
ment of the city's revenues and to
the principle of equality in the dis
position of the burdens of the gov
i. er'ament.
The Advocate takes no stock in
the demagogic appeals to class
prejudices so common nowadays,
nor do we believe in building up one
i. class of citizens at the expense of
' any other class or classes. Neither
do we believe that because a man is
rich he must be therefore dishonest
and ready to oppress the poorer
- classes. All men are selfish, how
ever, and it is not stretching the
I facts to say that most men will
evade taxation so long as it is pos- a
sible to do so without deliberately
lying. We have the testimony of
the Times-Democrat to the effect 1
that in New Orleans, at least, it is t
not uncommon to go even further I
than this in order to secure reduced
assessments. Such facts are dis- t
creditable to New Orleans and it r
behooves the assessors to see to it
that no evasions or subterfuges are
permitted to defeat their efforts in F
making every man contribute his a
just proportion to the revenues of
the State, which, if the Times- h
Democrat be correct, have suffered a
seriously from under-assessments ti
in that city.
