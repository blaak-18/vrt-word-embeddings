The Report of the Sub-Commit
tee on Louisiana.
Washington, Jan. Il.-The state
ment telegraphed from the Republican
that the whole committee hadl
started for New Orleans was wild.
There is, however, undoubted discon
tent. It is stated as indicative of
the character of the report, that Mr.
Potter, the Demooratic member of
the committee, has been selected to
phrase it. The Star says the full
committee on Southern affairs met
this morning to confer with the sqb
committee who went to New Orleans
to investigate the condition of affairs
in Louisiana. It is indicated', through
the evidence submitted, they will re
port.
1. That at the late election in Lou
isiana there was no intimidation of
colored voters.
2. That the White League discus,
sed but voted down a proposition to
discharge servants who voted the (Re
publican ticket.
3. That the Returning Board was
a fraud.
4. That the United States troops
executed orders issued by Marshal
Packard on election day.
5. That the disorder in the Legis
lature had ceased and the meeting
was entirely orderly and quiet at the
time Gen. De Trobriand entered the
Hall to arrest the members,
6. That the onty request Speaker
Wiltz made of Gen. De Trobriand
was to keep order in the lobby out
side of the Hall.
7. That the people ot Louisiana
generally have no sympathy with the
Kellogg Government, and that the
colored men who say they are Nation
al Republicans proclaimed themselves
as State Democrats, in order to get
rid of Kellogg.
8. That the police force in New Or
leans is demoralized.
The Cabinet meeting to-day was
for the consideration of the special
message on Louisiana affairs; but
not being ready, the session was de
voted to conversationover events
there. The message will be consi
dered in the regular Cabinet meeting
to-morrow. "
The Kellogg crew calls loudly for
another committee to thoroughly in
vestigate our condition, lnd when we
know thatthe gentlemen who report
as above were demanded by the same
authority, it seems strange to us that
Kellogg could find one partizan to
defy public opinion further. It is
useless for them to attempt any more
investigation dodges as we perfectly
understand their motives. Time is
all they desire. The "hand writing
on the wall" is too plain to be mis
understood and the enemies of free
government in Louisiana see their
downfall full well, and this cry for
other "investigations' is but to keep
Congress from immediate action in
the matter. They desire but one
"more blow," and as soon as that is
accomplished, we will be troubled
with these men no more-and that is,
to fund their illgotten and illegal bonds
and warrants under the new consti
tutional amendments. This they will
attempt, and we can at this moment
see nothing to deter them from doing
so.
The Kind of a Man Sheridan Is.
A reporter of thie St. Louis Repub.
lican interviewed the General of the
armies of the United States on the
morning of the 6th inst., and gives
in his paper a very full and e.nter
taining acconnt of what the General
had to say of'matters and things in
New Orleans, arid what hIe thought of
Generals Emory and Sheridan.
What Gen. Shermnan, the comman
der of the forces of the United States,
may think of the nature of the con
flict which has been unceasingly wa
ged by our people, for years, against
corruption and oppression, can be
matter of small moment to any one,
inasmuch as hle is a soldier, and it
has come to pass in these latter days
that soldiers know nothing but their
orders, and that whether those or
ders look to the bombardment of a
city full of women and children, or
the dispersing of the Legislature of a
State, they must be enforced. What
Sherman thinks, however, of two of
his subordinate officers is of more
consequence, and hence we note spe
cially what he said of Emery aud
Sheridan.
The former, hlie thought, was "a
good man, an excellent officer of the
old school, but perhapa a little timid
in interfering in the civuil afairs of the
State." The italics are ours. Sheri
dan, he said, "is a kind-hearted, no
ble-minded man, accessible to any
who may have a suit to urge. But
he is a soldier also, and does not hes
itate to do his duty. If he thought
it necessary, and believed it a matter
of douty, the city of New Orleans
would be no more regarded than an
Indian village. He would not hesi
tate to level it. That is the kind of
a man Sheridan is. But be is also
prudent and discreet, and will do
nothing to complieate matters or pre
cipitate events."
Poor old Gen. Emory, snubbed by
the President, insulted by Gen. Sher
man, over-slanaghed by Sheridan, and
doomed to attend the whistle-call of
the most abject human being in Chris.
tendom, his fate is a sad one indeed,
and there lave been times in the his
tory of this country whe an officer
so sat upon, so grossly and flagrantly
maltreated, would hlave torn his coln
mission into tatters and retired from
a service in which lhe could only reap
di honor.
The statement that Gen. Emory
was, "perhaps, a little timid about
interfering in the civil affdirs of tihe
State," has been proven by Enmory's
snbt/qnent conduct and ready sub
serviency to Kellogg to be entirely
unfounded; in fact, a base slander,
for hle supervised tIe disposition of
the Legislation, and in every way
proved his readiness to commit any
act of outrage upon thie rights of the
people's representatives.
Sherman will, no doubt, be delight
ed to learn that Emory was altogethl
er underserving of the censure imu
Ilied in his remark.
However the commanding General
may have erred in his estimate of
Emory's character, there can be no
question of his correctness as regards
Sheridan. The notorious barn burn
er and butcher of Piegan women is
evidently a man of his own heart, a
large-hearted, noble-minded fellow,
who would not hesitate a moment to
level New Orleans, or to treat it "as
an Indian village," wlich, being in
terpreted, nleans that the leveling
process would be accompanied with
the indiscriminate butchery of women
and children.
A large-hearted and noble-minded
fellow, truly ! Qaite a soldier, and in
every way worthy of his military and
civil chiefs.
The time is coming when the sol
dier who dares to utter such senti
ments, the officer who dares defy the
civil authority, will be hooted at by
citzens everywhere. The time is
not far distant, thank God ! when the
soldier, be lie the General command
ing, or his meanest subordinate, who
dares intrude upon tihe floor of the
House of Representatives of a State
in the Union, for the purpose of in
terrupting its proceedings, will be
visited with the sultmary and con
dign punishment he deserves. Un
less the genius of liberty has indeed
departed front our once happy, pros
perous and fair land, the doom of
such traitors as Slheridan, Williams,
Grant and Morton is sealed.
Benedict Arnold was a gentleman
and a pure-minded patriot compared
with any of the lot.-N. O. Bulletin.

THE FRIENDS OF LIBERTY.
Gorernor Gaston, of Massachusetts, re
fers to Louisiana.
BosTon, Jan. 7, 1875.
The following passage was added
by Governor Gaston to his address
shortly before its delivery :
The presence of an armed force of
the United States in a Legislature of
a State for the purpose of setting an
election contest between political
parties is matter of great concern to
all people of all States, more especial
ly in a case were the possible effect
of such presence may be to subvert
tihe popular will and impose upon a
people rulers whom tlhey have not
selected, l invite the immediate at
tentiou of the legislature to this sup
ject.
Goversor Alle, of Ohio, on the Fed
eral Outrage.
CoLUMDUs, Jan. 7, 1875,
Governor Allen has just sent the
following message to the General As
sembly, whlich was referred to the
Comnittee on Federal Relations:
I desire to call your attention to
the grave circuumstances of the inter
ference of Federal troops in tihe or
gaeniuzation and proceedings of the
Legislature of a sister State. If the
reported action of the military in un
seating persons elainming to be menm
Ie's of tiee Louisiana Legislature and
giving tlheir places to persons contes
ting thIe same is true and is legal and
proper, then the same interference
would be legal and proper, here, and
it seems to me to be the duty of the
representatives of the people of this
State to at once enter a vigorous pro
test against an election that may be
made a precedent at some future time
for the overtlhrow of efvil govern
ment here. If there is a law war
ranting thile settiog of contested elec
tion cases in State Legislatures by
the use of Federal troops, then, in
my judgment, you should request its
immediate repeal; ff there is no law
for it then your indignant protest
should beheard at Washington, in
sisting upon such action by Congress
as will prevent in the future such fla
grant outrages against civil liberty.
Governor Brows, of Tennessee, mon the
Trampled Liberties of Lomuisiana.
NASHVILLE, Jan. 7, 1875.
Governor brown in his message to
day refers to Louisiana matters as fol
lows :
Permit me to express my congra
tulastionsa that, unlike the Legislative
Assembly of our sister State, you
hlaie been' allowed to anselmble peace
ably ad Iperfect you organization
without intimidation. No mllilitary
force surround, your Capitol or dri
ves from their rightful seats the re
piesentatives of tl e people. The
edict of a petty tyrant does not here
avail to disperse the State Legisi;l
ture. Yet, your immunity fron such I
anll oltlrage is just nlow l;llae mlore
conIspicuous by the spectacle of Lou- t
isian.i tranpled illunder oot and des.
poil'd of her liberties. If we may
credit thit reports, thilt,; reach us
through the dalyiiy press and wlhich
seem to have the sanction of official
althority, the power of the national
government through its nilitary itrln
is being used for the sualversion of
tile liberties of the pl'eijle of Louis
iana. Possibly it is not in your pow
er to do more than interpose a sol
estn and earnest protest against this
gl;arlng crime. Yet if this be all that
the representatives .t'? so valorous ai
State as Teunessee may do, I trust
that your protest lmay be made with l
such emphlasis ind earnestness as to
arrest the stteition of every patriotic I
citizen in this Republic and awaken I
the people everywhere to a sense of i
danger that threatens our constitu- a
tional liberties.

Richmond, Jan. 7, 1875.
A caucus of conservative members
of the General Assembly will be held
to-morrow night to give expression
regarding the Louisiana affairs.
The State Senators were in caucus
last night on the same subject, but
decided to postpone action till the

against the Louisiana Indignity.
Harrisburg, Jan. 7, 1875.
The condition of
AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA
among prominent politicians now as
semtbled here is a subjlect which is
creating grave excitement. A reso
lution denouncing in bitter language
the outrages committed there by the
adminstration was prepared by sere
ral members of the House, which ad
journed to-day, however, before it
could be. rewritten and put into pro
per shape. It will no doubt be read
as soon as the members reassemble,
when an .expression is likely to he
given that will be stern and decided.

can be no doubt of thie President's
complete success in destroying the
sovereignty and prostrating the liber

To Corn Beef.-Pack the beef, cut
into pieces weighing not over six or
eight pounds, into a cask, usiny two,
pounds of salt to one hundred po:leulds
of beef. In from two to four days
the meat will be nearly covered with
a brine composed principally of thi,
blood which was in the meat, and
which was drawn out by the action
of the dry salt. Then take out the
beef, rinse it well to remove all the
blood, and repack, using four pounds
of salt to the one hundred pounds of
beef. Then take for each one hun
dred pounds of meat three ipoundl'
of salt, two ounces of saltpeter, two
ounces of cloves, one ounce of ea\ -
enue peper, and three pounds of clena
light sugar or three pints of Inollsses.
If the beef is not from a yolung anli
mal add to the above two ounces of
saleratus. Dissolve the ingredients
in water, boil and skim, then cool
and pour over the meat, adding wa
ter enough to cover all well. A stone
should be laid on the meat to keep it
beneath the brine. The "drying"
beef and tongues must be taken out
in four weeks, washed and hung up
to dry. Beef cured in this way will
keep into hot weather. If the brine
is drawn off in May and new put on,
with five or six pounds of salt to the
ihundred pounds, adding also one
fourth of a pound of black pepper, the
beef can be kept all through the hot
weather, though it will not be so ten
der after the second brine is put on.

A Red ink for marking clothes,
which is not attacked by soap. alka
lies or acids, is prepared by Welger
as follows: Enough finely pulverized
cinnabar to form a moderately thick
liquid, is very intimately mixed with
egg albumasn previously dilated with
an equal bulk of water and beaten to
a froth and filtered through fine linen.
Mlarks tormed on cloth with this li
quid, by means of a quill, are lized,
after they have become dry, by pres

a hot iron. The ink will keep in well
closed bottles for a long time without
separation of the suspended cinna

A Good Salad.-Here isa salad tllhat
will delight those who eat cucumber
withl bread and cheese: Take a to
mato not over-ripe, and cut it into
slices, as yon would a encumber;
take a small onion, and cut it uip as
fine as you can, lsprinkle it over the
tomnate slices, add salt, pepper and
vinegar at discretion, and you will
have a salad which, as a relish, puts
the cucaober to shuame.-Gardiner's
Chronicle.
Green Corn Fritters.-Boil six ears
of corn; scrape tthe corn from the
cob while warm. To two cups of
corn add three eggs; beat the yolks;
mix with the corn, three tablespoom
fils of cream sliand a small teacupful
of flour, with a little salt; heat the
whites to stlfT froth, and add last.
Bake as griddle cakea.--CuOnltivator.
Rice Pancakes.-Boil half a pound
of rice to a jelly. When cold, mix
with it a pint of crena, four eggs, a
little salt and nutmeg. Stir in eight
oances of butter, just warmed, and
add as much flour as will make batter
thick enough. FTry in as little lard as
possible.
