,,-BORGE PEABODY.
Ti- eighteenth day of February
tmarked the hundredth anniversary of t
George Peabody. Fitting cere- t
: monies were observed in England
and the United States, and thou- t
.:, 'sands united to do honor to a man
who, beyond all others, deserves to s
be ranked as a lover of his fellow
aen. C
Geo. Peabody was born of poor
parents in the little hamlet of Dan
vers, Mass., in 1795. He received d
but a meager education, being barely a
able to read and write. At i z he a
became a clerk in his native town for F
three years, spent a year with his r'
grandfather in Thitford, Vt., and in a
a8s a entered his brother's store in 0
Newburyport. A fire having de- tl
stroyed his brother's store, he was
employed in his uncle's store in r
Georgetown, D. C. After remain- d
ing with him sometime, George s
formed a partnership with Elisha ai
Riggs in his wholesale dry goods t
trade in Baltimore. Under his u
management the business prospered,
and branch houses were opened in P
â€¢ New York and Philadelphia. Four it
years after Mr. Peabody withdrew re
and opened a banking house in
London. While in England he was
enabled to render the State" of o;
Maryland and also the United States p1
many important services. He died st
in 1869. ' 01
Mr. Peabody stands pre-eminent a'
among men in beneficence and se
charity. Out of a large fortune of ct
over $14,ooo,ooo, he gave over hs
$9,ooo,ooo to charity and education, P
and all of it during his lifetime.
We of the South especially owe L,
S much to him. Seeing the-great need or
of the South just after the war, he S<
gave over $3.50oo,oo to the cause tl
of education. Of this sum a large he
amount is placed at interest in the de
South. Among the institutions va
supported by this fund are the Pea- cr
body Normal College at Nashville he
en
and various normal schools, pub- so
lic schools, and institutes in the W
Southern States. ' ric

$5,136 zo ita
The total amount expended in the ne
South last year was over $70o,ooo. ler
Examples are so rare of men who bu
give their wealth to benefit man- art
kind that if can but excite admir- Th
ation in every breast to behold one any
who gives with such royal gen- cia
erosity, and especially gives in his vis
own lifetime. Peabody neither ca]
built a splendid tomb nor founded a poi
family of wealth; but he has en- to
graven his memory in the hearts of for
all ages, and left a glorious life be- tor
fore the youth of all countries. lot
Honest, noble, and generous ! abs

T7E ~ BOUNVTY CLALI.S. B3u
News from Washington regarding pul:
the bounty are of a more encourag- tha
ing nature of late. A number of Bui
senators and representatives have whc
been impressed with the justice of lore
the sugar planter's claims and it is Am
thought with average good luck the " hi
the Louisiana delegation will suc- met
ceed in getting a majiority of votes ing
in both houses. Mlen who have corn
always been considered enemies of "dr
the bounty measure have changed dro]
their way of thinking and some have sma
expressed the intention of using unh
their inSuenBce and votes in behalf cral
of Louisiana's interests. Senator in a
3Manderson, one of the leading perj
smeabers of the Senate, is a staunch crus
advocate of the payments and has saw,

lVI/OLESOJE AD VICE.
try Mr. F. L. Maxwell, president of
of the American Cotton Grower's Pro
re- tective Association for the State of
.nd Louisiana, has issued an address to
>u- the cotton-growers of this State
an Mr. Maxwell's address contains
to some timely and wholesome advice,
,_ which, if followed by those of our
cotton-growers who are in a posi
tor tion to do so, cannot fail to result
in- in much good. He advises a re
ed duction in the acrt.age of cotton,
ly and! a more extensive production of
he articles of home consumption.
or Farmers ii" Lafayette appreciate the
lis ruinous effectg of a one-crop policy
in and reports from different sedtions
in of the parish go to show that they
e- thoroughly understand the present
as situation. The Gazette learns from
in reliable sources that they have re
n- duced the acreage of the fleecy
ge staple as much as practicable, and
ha are turning their attention toward
ds the raising of crops that can be
us used at home.
d, We regret not having the space to
in publish Mr. Maxwell's address in
ur its entirety. We are only able to
, reproduce its closing paragraph:
in It is clearly to the interest of all
cotton growers to reduce their acre
as age in cotton and raise more corn, I
of oats and forage crops. Every
es planter should make his place self
:d sustaining, raising and producing
on the place everything possible
that he consumes. This will natur
lt ally reduce the acreage and expen
id ses, and will enhance the price of 1
of cotton, and at the same time, you
er have your supplies and are not de- i
I pendent on some one to furnish you.
Meat, corn, hay and oats can be
e. produced as cheap and cheaper in
Me Louisiana than in Illinois, Indiana
d or Iowa. If every planter in the
1e South will raise his corn, hay, oats, t
tobacco, meat mules, horses, cat
tle, sheep, etc , in fact everything
,e he consumes, they will soon be in- C
ie dependent, the price of cotton ad
is vanced so as to make it a paying
L_ crop, and the lands greatly en- f
hanced in value. T'hrs will induce c
emigration and our country will
soon be filled with a good class of
e Western farmers, who have grown n
rich in the West raising supplies
and selling to the South. s

oMr. Burns does not find Amer
, ica a paradise, but comes back, he
- avows, rather cured of cosmopol
O itanism and with "a sneaking kind
e ness for England," where all prob- ti
lems, it is true, are not yet solved, i
o but where there is a reasonable w
- amount of unrefined happiness.,
- There are no dukes in America, ril
e and bishops are invisible in the so
- cial landscape; but there is no di- fr
vision of the earth's surface where
r capital exercises a more absolute r
t power, where labor is more exposed
to "brigandage"-the truck system,
F for instance, reigns in all its preda- ad
tory completeness-or where the re.
lot of the lower people seems more
absolutely hopeless. The States
are free of all English institutions,
all power is everywhere with the se
people, and the result has been, in ta]
Burn's opinion, "a plutocratic re- '
public run by concentrated capital," h
that is, by great companies. Mr.
Burns half doubts, apparently, Pa
whether even a great English land- Me
lord can be as tyrannical as anCo
American railway company, which in As
Chicago kills a citizen or two a day Di
merely for his presumption in cross- Jus
ing its rails, and allows, or rather
compels, its goods-brakesmen to Toi
"drop off the cars like flies," each Bsi
drop meaning a human being Ro,
smashed into a bloody pulp. These Bri
unhappy wretches do their work, Bri
crawling over the roofs of the cars Tot
in all weathers; the roofs get slip- CRia
pery and the men fall off, to be Jun,
crushed under the wheels. " "I Fee
saw," sav. Mr. Burns to a reporter Irot
of the Daily Chronicle, "'in one
journey to Pittsburg, two horribleFor
cases of mutilation." Nobody ap- For
parently cares, one result of per
fect freedom being a "reckless Tot
waste of life," and people "slaugh- I
tered wholesale," so that:the number
killed at level crossing in Chicago
alone exceeds the whole number
killed annually on all the railroads
in Great Britain. There is no re
dress and apparently no compensa
tion paid, the corporation being, C
we believe, too powerful to fight. A
This very Chicago should be the
workmen's New Jerusalem. The
city is quite new, is full of life and sent
enterprise, pays to skilled workmen tent
enrmnous wagcs, snmeti:nes as-high L.a.
but a L=a day, elects its own govern
rith .ent, is entirely free from an)
low aristocracy of birth, is choked with
uld means of education, and is the
on nearest approach to hell Mr. Burns
int. is able to conceive. Or rather, it
nor is "hell in a pocket edition," its
ues workmen worked to death, its mu
to nicipality cynically corrupt, its
"unemployed," or half employed, a
festering mass of oppressed persons
weltering in filth under sanitary
of conditions which even plain-spoken
ro- Mr. Burns dare not describe.
of Clearly, perfect democracy does
to not insure the New Jerusalem,
te rather wanders further from it than
ns asistocracy does in this country,
ce, where you will find a village gov
,ur erned by an unelected squire and a
)si- nominated parson, and farmers
ult who buy their stations, yet where
re- nobody is overworked, and laborers
