The Ballot Reform Convention
called by J. C. Manning, and held
in New Orleans last week, was
well attended by prominent men of
all political parties.
A form of organization for
leagues or clubs was adopted and
it is to be holped that a strong or
ganization will be built up and
much good result therefrom.
The attendence from this state
was of a prominent character.
Secretary of State Adams, Senator
Gauthreaux and the leading men
of New Orleans Ballot Reform
League joined in the movement.
While there were several popu
lists and a few republicans from
other states, the bulk of the
meeting and especially from this
state was of prominent democrats.
This is as it should he. The party
in power is always necessarily res
ponsible for the proper execution
of the laws of a country, and that
is the whole trouble in the South,
a want of respect for and execu
tion of our election laws. And
the democratic party being the
party in power must correct the
evils or go out of power in dis
grace.
We believe there are numbers of
honest people in the Democratic
party thoroughly disgusted with
fraud and consequent corruption,
who are .determined to purify it or
get out of it, and if they hope to
maintain the respect of good peo
ple they will have to act soon and
vigorously.
