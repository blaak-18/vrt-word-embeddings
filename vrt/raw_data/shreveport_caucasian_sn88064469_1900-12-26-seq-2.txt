mimal Barker aid:
"The diffoulty has been that we have
not had soldiersanoagh is the Philip
pines. The Filipinos have not felt that
they would be protected from the insur
gents in their laa4si If they should
come out boldly in favor of the Amert.
coant tiwre is no telling when the insur
gents would-swoop down da them. We
have not enough troops in the islands to
prevent them. But things are better
now than they have been, although we
should by no means withdraw our troops
without teplelong them.
" With the passage of the army bill
we can send our regulard over there to
take the place of the volanteer when
they are called home In the spring.
This sot only should be done, but must
be dose if the islands are to become
quiet under the American gag. Then,
again, every ofleer whom Uncle Sam
sends to the Philippines 9hould ezes.ies
the strictest fategrity and honesty Is
his methods. Just at this time the people
of the islands woald hag a mai for ly

WINDOW SHADES.
How to Prolonc Their Usefulness.
Decoration and Color.
There may be rips in the slide cas
ings or the shades themselves may
need turning upeide down. Fly taking
them off the rollers directions will be
found in print pasted on the roller
which will enable the housekeeper to
make a change that will prolong the
usefulness and freshness of the shade,
though at the expense of a trifle of its
length. The lower hem must be cut
away to release the incased stick, the
shade unrolled and the tiny tacks
which attach it to the roller taken out
and saved.
Take the shade top for the bottom
by creasing a hem wide enough to hold
the stick. Sew it on the machine
after unscrewing the ring that holds
the cord by which the shade is raised
or lowered. Insert the stick in the
new hem, screw in the ring and care
fully follow directions regarding tack
lag the shade to the roller. By rule
and square see that the upper end is
not only straight, but that it is at right
angles with the sides, else the shade
will be one sided and wabbly. Window
shades are in better taste without a
bottom fringe. They are for use, not
decoration, and fringe only wears into
tatters and rips with the least provoca
tion. Again, the housekeeper who un
derstands her business will never al
low a shade to he drawn down over an
open window. Where privacy is need
ed either close the blind with the case
ment open or close the window and
then draw down the shade; otherwise
it will shortly become discolored and
broken.
The color of shades is a matter of
taste. A dark green is best for the
eyesight. When it can be affortTed, it
is well to have two sets, green shades
Inside of white or cream, especially
in sleeping and sitting rooms having

Ceoeeralaq Mirerrs.
There are so many forms of mirrors,
and It is so eharming to see the design
of the mirror in secordance, in reso
nance, with the general effect of the
room, to see it so placed that not only
is it seen to the best advantage Itself,
but is also enabled to reflect gracefully,
for, like a pl re, it requires careful
choosing and l placing. People
who Imagine t a mirror can be plac
ed anywhere, made to fill any unoccu
pied space upon, the wall, have no sym
pathy with its real purpose. The life
of the mirror is an analogue to the life
9f man.
He was bans it a ship
O( the breast l the river of T11m,
As what be s-s i, so have his thouehts bee;
As ib the world o its banks,
So i the his of the mss.
Considered so the mirror becomes In
deed-worthy of our time. It should
cast us some trouble to select, some
thought to place discreetly.
You may have one mirror or many.
It or they must be of the design you
admire, hang where you will, reflecting
as much or as little as you desire. The
primary object of a room is to comfort
and second is to reflect Its owner. And
so the largest mirror in your room
should be the room itself, coeludies
