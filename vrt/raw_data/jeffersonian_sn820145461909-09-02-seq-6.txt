LETTER FROM ONE OF THE
LEADERS WHO MADE WAR ON
THE TOBACCO TRUST.
Dear Friend: —I am sending you a
clipping taken from the Hopkins
ville (Ky.) Independent, which I have
seen in many leading papers, and
which you have doubtless noticed.
How does it strike you?
“Washington, July 17. —Neither
trust-fed, trust-clothed nor trust
armed will the American regular sol
diers be if Secretary of War Dickin
son can prevent.
“The Secretary of War has just is
sued a new rule for the purchase of
supplies for the army. He directed
Brig.-Gen. Henry G. Sharpe, com
missary man, to enter into no direct
contract with any corporation which
Is a party to a trust or combination in
restraint of trade. He has also di
rected that no dealings be had by
the department with any agent or
middleman who may be a represen
tative of such a concern.”
Had I better remind him that some
time last winter one of his Great
Federal Judges sentenced Mitchell
and other Labor Leaders to the peni
tentiary for ignoring an injunction
against boycotting the Buck Range
Stove Co., and that if he don’t look
out he will get a dose of the same
medicine at the hands of the Federal
Court?
. Now wouldn’t it be a shame to see
Uncle Sam’s gotee cut, his hair cut,
and white and black stripes placed on
him and put in the pen just for boy
cotting my Cousin Tom Fortune
Ryan’s and Uncle Buck Duke’s little
corporation. Sometimes I just feel
like boiling over and going off in thin
vapor.
If the cotton ginner would only
pool, press and store instead of rush
ing on the streets and beg some one
to “take” it so he can get back emp
ty-handed to “Betsy and the Ba
bies” the South wold soon grow rich
again and the old hill sides would
bloom in verdure. You say it is too
large, then the more people would
get the benefit and the more mil
lions would go to feed, clothe and ed
ucate the ragged children, and less
to hire man hair dressers and buy
costly gowns for one's wearing.
Your magazines are all sold out at
Danville, Va., in a jiffy, and I could
not get one July 3. Why don’t they
get enough to supply demand. lam
behind on July and August. Re
member me to your son, wife and
Miss Needham, and with very best
wishes for your health and success,
Yours truly,
JOEL B. FORT.
CONTENDS THAT FOREIGN MIS
SIONS ENDED LONG AGO.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l have been
reading some of your articles on
Missions with great interest. But my
experience is that the man who ex
poses the rottenness of politics or
religion is a doomed man. That the
men who should be your best friends
are the ones in the end who will cry
the loudest for your crucifixion.
There is one thing that you have
overlooked in this discussion, and
that is that the mission work was all
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
done by the apostles within 31 years.
Ist. The apostles were told to go in
to, or among, the orderly ones, the
well behaved ones, the organized
ones, and make proclamation of the
good news to all whom had had their
minds changed. (See the Greek of
Mark, 16th chapter.)
They were commanded to go and
do this. Did they go? Did they do
this? The last verse says they did.
2nd. Romans 10-18 shows that
they did what was commanded.
3rd. Also Col. 1:6, and also 23rd
verse.
These quotations show that Christ
did not command them to do some
thing they could not do. But that
they did do all He commanded them
to do.
Now, a thing you should know is,
how could they do this without
money and without a passport from
the governments to travel?
If you were in possession of these
facts you never would say that you
were in favor of foreign missions.
Yours, etc.,
INDEPENDENT.

WITH YOU IN YOUR FIGHT.
Dear Sir:—l have just read with
a great deal of interest in your paper
an account of the death of Elsie Sei
gel. lam sorry that the world is so
blind, and it is a shame that the mis
sionaries, under whose observation
such conduct came, should fail to
give the alarm. I a mwith you all
the way in your fight on the insane
measures the different congregations
are reaching. They should stop and
think and put a stop to it and recall
the missionaries, and until they were
ready to go out as the apostles, like
Paul and Peter did, they should be
kept at home. It is plain that the
ideas and the work outlined by most
of the missionaries is not the way
God did the work. When Church
gets to judging a man or woman’s
fitness for the foreign field by his de
sire to go as the apostles did, then,
and not till then, will they have the
right kind of fruit for their labor,
and there will not be so many of
them eager to go.
May God bless you, and may you
push the fight till the different de
nominations are brought to a saner
view of this subject, is my prayer.
E. B. HILL.
Metter, Ga.
WILLING TO LEND A HELPING
HAND.
Dear Tom:—l try to keep up with
all your good sense and logic, and
when my paper is delayed over its
time I am inquiring about it at every
mail there is. No man on earth is a
stronger believer in you than myself,
and I feel like I know you are scoffed
and scorned more than any man on
earth; but I know you are right. I
have been raised in the very lap of
Methodism, but am not one of those
prejudiced fools who can not see an
inch from his nose. I have always
thought what our people did was O.
K., but you have certainly given me
an eye-opener. I feel like God will
crown your efforts for the good you
131)* TJeffersonlan
have done and are still endeavoring
to do. I feel like you are stronger
today than ever before, if the people
only had the manhood to own it. It is
surprising to know how they clamor
and hanker after your literature. I
want you to put your right foot fore
most every time they assail or vilify
you. Some of my neighbors want a
few copies, not more than six, and I
will sell them and return you the
money. I intend to subscribe for the
magazine in a few days to get a knife.
1 am the same unworthy, but true,
former,
J. G. KITCHEN.
P. S. —Send the July number.
Ohoopee, Ga., July 26, 1909.
A DEMOCRAT WHO VOTES IT.
My dear Sir:—l am a subscriber
to your weekly Jeffersonian, and
wish to say I take six other papers.
But I would not give the Jeffersonian
for all the others put together. I
want to thank you for the fight you
are making on Foreign Missions. I
have voted with you, Mr. Watson,
every time I have had an opportunity
and will be with you in your fight for
the common people to the last ditch.
I am a member of the Elbert Coun
ty Democratic Executive Committee.
But I voted for you last October be
cause I believed from the depths of
my heart that you were the only
Democrat remaining. I did every
thing in my power to get your tickets
in every precinct in the county, and
my district went for you sto 1. So
you may know the party lacks a great
deal of being dead in old Elbert yet.
I think we should have a State meet
ing somewhere and get organized for
active work. I find that the people
are anxious for us, the People’s party,
to do something on that line.
Mr. Watson, I could write you
much more, but I know you are a
very busy man. So here is hoping
that you may live to reap the rich
harvest you so honorably deserve.
I am yours,
H. B. SAXON.

RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING THE
FLORIDA SENATORS.
We, the members of Concord Local
No. 349 of the Florida Division of
the Farmers’ Educational and Co
operative Union of America, remem
ber that,
Whereas, we helped to elect Uni-
ted States Senators Taliaferro and
Fletcher and Congressman Mays to
their respective offices; and
Whereas, they have not worked
for the farmers’ interests as they
should, but have proved themselves
steadfast champions of the lumber
trust; therefore,
Resolved, That we, as farmers, the
backbone and should be the masters
of the nation, feel very keenly the
lack of representation in both houses
of Congress; and realize, with sicken
ing" disgust, that we are helping to
pay the representatives of our op
pressors; therefore,
Resolved, That we will hereafter,
of necessity, remember the above
named incumbents as enemies to the
best interests of the consumers, and
vote accordingly in all future elec
tions.
Resolved, That these resolutions be
spread upon the pages of our inute
spread upon the pages of our minute
book and a copy be sent to each of
the following papers: The Havana
News, The Gadsden County Times,
Our Southern Home, The Weekly Jef
fersonian, The Farmers’ Union News,
and the National Co-Operator, and
respectfully ask them to publish
same.
(Signed) L. M. LEWIS, Chairman.
W. H. JOHNSON,
O. N. CHESTER.
Ed. Note: It gives us pleasure to
the foregoing resolutions. We
rejoice at any evidence that the plain
people are waking and mean to pun
ish the Congressmen who betrayed
them to organized and predatory
wealth.
SENT CLARKE’S “PIECE.”
Dear Sir: —Enclosed find another
harangue from another simlin head
from over here in Alabama. If he
is not too little a “tater,” do him up
as you did Archibald. To me that
one article was worth twice the sub
scription to both of your journals.
Why is it that nothing but simlin
heads and small taters will jump on
you? We have got some tolerably
fair talent in the Methodist church
over here in Alabama, but they have
sense enough not to tackle the best
informed writer on Missions that it
has ever been my pleasure to read
after. May you live long to let in
the true light, is the wish of your ar
dent admirer,
D. McEACHERN.

IN A QUANDARY ABOUT FOR
EIGN MISSIONS.
My Dear Sir: —As a church mem
ber I have struggled with this For
eign Mission scheme a number of
years in an earnest, honest endeavor
to reconcile it with the universality
of the Christian religion, and I have
utterly failed.
I have read some of your articles
on Foreign Missions and your honest
doubts manfully expressed appeal to
me, and while we owe a public duty,
as well as a private moral obligation,
to deal honestly with all mankind,
are we doing a wise thing to con-
