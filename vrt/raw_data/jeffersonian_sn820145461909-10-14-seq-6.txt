LETTER FROM DR. WAKEFIELD.
“Mr. J. J. Barge,
“Atlanta, Ga.
“Dear Sir: —Your letter regarding
the article copied from Crawfords
ville paper arrived today. It is a
great surprise to me and gives me,
I hope, a final lesson in dealing with
reporters. The ‘quotations’ you
make are marvelous! What I did
say, in outline, was this:
“That the murder of Elsie Sigel in
New York was due to a lack of
knowledge in mission work among
Orientals. That for centuries Ori
ental people had looked upon woman
as a being created to satisfy their
passions and raise their children, but
in no way the equal of themselves.
A ‘good wife’ is like a good dog, and
receives a like consideration.
“Now, for our American girls, with
little or no knowledge of the Chinese
character, to go and work among
them as they do in this country is the
height of folly, and is so considered
by the foreign mission boards. In
China the lady missionaries never
work among the men and would never
think of doing such a thing.’’ [But
Dr. August Bach says that they do.
He says that there are Sigel cases in
China.]
“The lady missionaries do go all
over the country working among the
women. They take pains to comply
with the Chinese laws of propriety.
Younger ladies always take an older
Chinese woman with them —usually
the older married lady missionaries
do the same. They are treated with
respect, and I have never known or
read of any trouble of the type of
this New York affair happening in
China. I never heard of a lady mis
sionary being ‘degraded by Chinese
men’.
“However, when a young Chinese
or Jap comes to this country—espe
cially to our colleges—the American
girls seem often to be fairly ‘pos
sessed’ with an infatuation for them.
This would be impossible if they un
derstood the Oriental view of woman.
“It is unjust to judge the Chinese
by this circumstance in New York.
They have had their standard of life
for over thirty centuries. Fox* a
young American girl to place such
temptation in their way is not fair —
and to judge them by such a thing is
unjust. The real sin was the tempt
ing of the Chinaman. In my mind,
their view of their women has been
the greatest of the Oriental weak
nesses. And the Oriental is growing
to realize this and is correcting it as
rapidly as one could expect or ask.
“Further, to judge all China by the
Cantonese is unjust. Over ninety
five per cent, of the Chinese in the
United States are Cantonese. The
Cantonese are the lowest grade Chi
naman. They are considered by the
Mandarin, or Northern Chinese,
much as we consider the negro in our
own country. They are held as a na
tional disgrace and excluded from
Northern ports and cities as rigidly
as we exclude them, because of their
low standard of living.
“The Chinese deeply deplore the
New York murder. They feel they
have been disgraced and are apt to
be misjudged. They are changing
with great rapidity their views of
their women. They are establishing
girls’ schools and treating their
wives, mothers and daughters with
greater respect. They need encour
agement and sympathy, and above all
they should not be criticised or
blamed for other people’s folly.
“Now, this is practically what I
gave in my talk. You can see the
whole spirit is opposite that of your
quotations. I can only think that
my talk was ‘garbled’ by one of
strong anti-Chinese, anti-mission prej
udices.” [Like Mrs. Mansell, for in
stance.]
“It angers me to have such a thing
go out, but a paper has you at their
mercy, and there is no use trying to
catch what has once been printed.”
[But Sister Mansell made one of
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
the disputed reports. She heard the
lecture, and is Wakefield’s friend.]
“Anything further I can do to help
you in this matter, kindly let me
know.” [Ask him to seek corrobo
ration from some member of that au
dience.]
“Truly,
“PAUL WAKEFIELD (M. D.),
“727 South sth St., Springfield, Ill.”
“P. S. —It comes to my mind that
in talking to that reporter I told him
in comparison some of the happen
ings in a Chinese town when an
American gunboat lands. The drink
ing, swearing, horse-racing and deal
ings among the Chinese women of
low type are unwritable. Things
that have happened in China with
American citizens compare very un
favorably with even this Sigel case in
New York. Yet these are ‘hushed up’
rapidly in China, and never appear
here at home. But 1 can’t help won
dering how the Chinese feel when we
make such a fuss about the Sigel case
when a Chinaman is implicated, while
we insist that a Chinese woman’s life
is a matter of sls to S3O when our
American men cut loose in China!
And we make such a fuss over JUST
Dim E!
“Oh, the folly, though. Put an
Oriental in a chop suey house, where
the fastest of the fast come in all
their debauchery, and he thinks he
sees American civilization at its
height. Then send a young Sunday
school girl in, writing kitten love
notes —and thirty centuries of full
blood passion beating in his veins!
What madness, and how unfair to the
Chinaman!
“PAUL WAKEFIELD.”
Ed. Comment: This report of his
lecture, made by Dr. Wakefield, is a
queer production. He says that
“there is no use trying to catch what
has once been printed”. Then, why
did Dr. Corey and Dr. Wakefield
make their lame efforts to catch it?
Both of them have been publishing
denials, in various papers and maga
zines.
The trouble with these gentlemen
is that they tried to catch it, and “it
catched’’ them.
The idea of attributing the report
to “some one of strong anti-Chinese,
anti-mission prejudices”! Mrs. Man
sell is the wife of the Christian min
• ister in whose church Wakefield lec
tured; and she made, over the tele
phone, one of the reports—AND IT
TAILIES WITH THE OTHER!

A BOLD, SUGGESTIVE LETTER.
Dear Sir:—ln your October Mag
azine is an article on race problem,
by S. Grady, Peary, Ga., which had
the same old tone.
I agree that the negro should be
moved, but still the South is in very
good condition, which any traveler
will conclude from observation, and
which our statistics prove.
Do we have wholesale starvation
as in Northern cities? Are our rural
districts filled with foreign scum, as
in the North? No. Why? Because
of the negro.
The negro has gotten used to our
country, and we are getting used to
him.
Some think we can not get along
together because we don’t associate,
but the castes among the Hindoos
get along all right, though they
don’t claim equality.
Does not the natural class distinc
tion between the races help to weld
TJaffersonlan
together more 'firmly the unity of
our race?
It seems to me that from the sim
ple fact that the negro can’t “work
up” in public works much, the white
laborer finds it easier to do so; for
there is a demand for him at “top”
where the negro is not.
To say that a plain education is
bad for a negro is like saying train
ing is bad for a dog and for the one
who trained him. For what is edu
cation but. mental, physical and moral
training?
Let’s turn the light of God’s truth
upon him, and let him see his black
ness; then he will be more resigned
to it.
But, the greatest need for him is
example. For us to say that he is
an imitator, then say how bad he is,
is not saying much for our own race,
is it?
Talk about respect for white wom
en; why a great part of the white
men are not respecting their own
wives and daughters; for they raise
their voices in condemnation of the
negro, and then go and whisper soft
ly in the black woman’s ear. But.
ah, the mulatto reveals that truth
wherever he goes. He is a living
monument to crime, and deserves
great credit if he be anything at all.
Let’s pray for the negro more,
And slay him not with vengeful
hand,
Then hallewed peace shall hover o’er
And - happy homes shall dot the
land.
Yours kindly,
THOS. E. BOGGS.
Groveland, Ga.

A BUSY MAN. BUT HE READS THE
JEF FE RSON IANS.
My dear Mr. Watson: —’Tis true
I’m a working man and have very lit
the time to read, during the day.
Being a “pill-roller” (druggist) I
work from sarly morning until a late
hour at included, but
manage to take a peep at the weekly
Jeffersonian. *,
I’ve been wanting to write to you
for a long time, but feel sure you
receive all the “endorsements” that
time will allow you to read. But I
have laid aside that feeling and won’t
feel satisfied until I “ease off” my
desires by writing you something.
I certainly do enjoy your timely
editorials, especially on Socialism
and the Foreign Mission question. It
does me good to the core to see how
you handle these subjects.
Your reply to M. D. Brand’s letter
in September 30th issue was some
thing “sticky,” in regard to the
“Land Trust.’ And I certainly do
sympathize with you in having to
devote your valuable time and space
to answering such a simple question
as, “Why it was that during Christ’s
own personal ministry, twenty-four
out of the thirty-six of His recorded
miracles were wrought for the healing
of the body.” I’m a Baptist, a Mis
sionary Baptist, and believe in
preaching the gospel of Christ to all
nations, but that’s all. It seems to me
if people would study their Bibles
more and pray unto Christ to help
them understand His meaning, I be
lieve the pill-mixing missionary and
the medical missionary would be com
ing home as straight as a martin to
his gourd.
With best wishes, I am,
Yours very truly,
J. A. HUNT.
Millen, Ga.
THE TIME IS RIPE FOR ORGANI
ZATION.
My Dear Sir: —I have missed get
ting the last two copies of the weekly
Jeffersonian; I can’t afford to miss a
copy. If it isn’t asking too much,
will you please send them to me?
I am going to organize a Jeffer
sonian Club as soon as possible. I
think the time is ripe for organiza
tion. The Democrats will soon kick
Bryan out of the party. Populist
principles were never more popular.
The people are going to see that those
principles that you have been advo
cating so long triumph. I have been
with you from the start; I would
have voted the Socialist ticket long
ago if it hadn’t been for your advice.
May the God in Heaven continue
to give you strength to lead us, is
my prayer.

A THIRTY YEARS’ WAR FOR BET
TER CONDITIONS?
Dear Sir:—l enclose $2.00 to ex
tend my subscription to the Jeffer
sonians. I will send in some sub
scriptions soon. Please send me
“Life and Speeches of Thos. E. Wat
son.”
I have been in the fight for better
conditions for thirty years, and have
long wished to live to see the day
when some one with the ability
would develop the courage to combat
the unnatural and unscriptural mis
sion work of the churches. There are
thousands who see it but are afraid
to fight it. I trust you will be spared
many years longer and continue your
noble efforts in behalf of a priest
ridden and overburdened people.

AN APPEAL.
For more than a year I have had
printed in the advertising columns
of this paper that I am a strong be
liever in the “deathless principles
of Thomas E. Watson”. At this time
I am pressed for money, and I ap
peal to every brother Populist to
help me close out my 1908 tobacco
crop, and help me out of this tight.

SHOULD NOT THE PEOPLE KNOW
THE FACTS ?
Dear Readers of the Jeffersonian:
It is doubtless the experience of
some of you—’tis of me—to converse
with men occasionally who oppose Mr.
Watson and disregard his teachings
on the ground that “he censures ev
erybody and everything.”
But we are confronted with the
question, “Should the people know
the facts?’’ If they should not, then
