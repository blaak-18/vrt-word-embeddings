victory here Friday when the Alle
gheny county grand jury returned 13
true bills involving 11 persons on var
ious charges of. rioting and inciting
riot, in connection with the fatal
attack upon parading Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan at Carnegie, Pa., Sat
urday night, August 25, 1923, during
which Klansman Thomas R. Abbott
of Atlasburg, Pa., was killed.
Patrick J. McDermott, an under
taker of Carnegie, who was indicted
February 19 by the same jury for the
murder of Klansman Abbott, was
among those yesterday indicted by
the same grand jury on a charge of
rioting.

the persons indicted Friday on
charges of rioting and inciting riot
are John Conley and Ira (alias Ike)
Irving, Burgess and Constable of
Carnegie respectively. Testimony

ments to have the men in readiness

men through that boro. It was tes
tified at that time that Conley had
ordered the chief of the fire depart
ment to have the fire hose connect
ed to prevent their procession.

Discourtesy to Klan
Members Is Denounced
PITTSBURGH, PA., March 6.—ln
dignation over the treatment accord
ed robed Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan who attended services in the
Methodist Protestant church at
Knoxville, was expressed in a letter
to the Keystone American, Pennsyl
vania Klan paper, from J. D. Cox,
representative of the Homestead
Council No. 110, Jr. O. U. A. M.
Mr. Cox stated that an invitation
had been extended to the Klansmen
to attend the special services, at
which time Judge F. P. Schoonmaker
of the United States district court,
was to deliver a special patriotic ad
dress. In response to this invitation,
more than 75 robed members ap
peared in the church. At no time
during the services, Mr. Cox declared
in his letter, was any mention made
of the presence of the members in
the church made, nor was any wel
come extended. The Klansmen took
part in the services and left at the
conclusion, it was stated, making no
declaration of any kind regarding
the lack of courtesy extended them.
of these are charged with rioting..
Anthony JScrow, Steve Burdis.
Joseph Saves, and Michael Hayes had
all been held to the grand jury
charged with riot, but true bills are
not returned in their cases.
Intimations that all of the indict
ed may be charged with murder lat
er on, if they are convicted of hav
ing participated in the riot, were
given by W. H. Proper of Atlanta,
Ga., national Ku Klux Klan investi
gator, following the return of the
true bills. Mr. Proper has had
charge of all investigation into the
riot and its fatal consequences. Mr.
Proper stated that it has been con
sidered invoking the 1922 act of the
Pennsylvania assembly which de
clares that all who have taken part
in a riot that terminates fatally are
liable for murder.
Strong Fight Seen
Three copies of the Martyred
Klansman, a booklet containing all
testimony introduced during the
hearings of defendants in the Car
negie riot, were sold late Friday af
ternoon to a nephew of Patrick Mc-
Dermott, at the office of the Key
stone American in Pittsburgh, it was
reported, which tends to show that
both McDermott, his relatives and
the church at large, are planning to
wage a strong fight for his salvation.
Un-American residents of Carnegie
were highly jubilant during the last
two months of 1923, after the Alle
gheny county coroner's jury had fail
ed to fix the blame for the killing of
Abbott, shortly after the fatal Aug
ust 25; and had released all of the
alleged participants in the fatal riot,
when they were brought for a hear
ing before Alderman Geo. Anderson
of Fifth and Wylie avenues, on vari
ous charges of rioting and inciting
riot.
Friday’s action of the Allegheny
county grand jury, it is believed, will
somewhat tend to show lawless ele
ments in this and every section of
the United States that justice can be
brought into play, even though every
sinister political and religious influ
ence be brought to bear to the con
trary.
No definite date for the court
hearings, of all the men indicted,
has been set.
CLARKSBURG, W. VA.. March 12—
Clarksburg chapter of the American
Red Cross has made an appeal to all
foreign-born ex-service men to ap
pear at the local headquarters be
fore March 3 and make application
for their second citizenship papers.
They will not have to go through the
long grind of red tape, officers of
the organization declare. The United
States government has set March 3
as the last day when foreign-born
may take advantage of this offer.
Service in the American army enti
tles them to first papers without the
usual questioning and routine work,
according to Mrs. Corrine Lockren,
secretary of the local organization.
It is believed by some that this is a
move to combat the power for good
of the Klan in the coming election.

Headquarters of General Washington at Chadds Ford
May Be Made National Shrine to First Great American
A nation-wide movement is afoot to make General George Washington’s headquarters at Chadds Ford,
Pennsylvania, a national shrine to the father of his country. It was here that the American flag was for the
first time raised over a continental army headquarters in the revolutionary war. During the battle of Bran
dywine, this was headquarters for the army. Many tourists stop at the building during the vacation months of
the year.
lowa’s Present Bible
Law Called Worthless
The present Bible law of lowu
really does not mean anything, mere
ly stating a fact without any provi
sion for enforcing and carrying out
of that statement of fact.
The government of the United
States of America, was inspired by
the teachings of the Bible. The con
stitution of our government was tak
en from the twelfth chapter of the
Book of Romans. When we consider
this fact we must grant that the Bi
ble is the very foundation upon
which our country stands. If it has
come to the time in our history when
it is required to pass a law to force
the reading of the instrument that
caused out existence as a nation, we
have not carried out the intentions
of our forefathers. Inasmuch as it
seems that we have so far failed in
this mission, a law of this nature
must be placed upon the statute
books to see to it that those who
have the responsibility of our future
generations are rightly guided.
The government of the United
States of America, does not compel
any man or woman to enter its pub
lic school system as a servant, but on
the contrary they enter this service
of their own volition. If the public
school with its regulations and
methods does not call forth the loy
al and unfailing support of the mem
bers of its staff; they can and should
retire from its service to fields of
endeavor that will meet with their
approval. Instead of this we find,
however, that they are insisting upon
the government changing certain
rules, and making certain laws to ap
pease their scruples on some personal
or organized creed, to which they
have subscribed; forgetting that they
entered this public service of their
own free will and accord.
There can not be offered any rea
son, worthy of consideration, why the
Bible should not be read by every
teacher, in every public school room
in this nation each and every morn
ing.
The Bible made possible the great
est document that ever came from
the pen of mortal man, the constitu
tion of the United States of Ameri
ca. Therefore, the two .are insepar
able. The American public school is
here because of that unity of the Bi
ble and the constitution.
We are a Christian nation because
we recognize that the Bible is the
inspired Word of God, and believe in
the teachings of the Son of God, as
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
KLAN SHOWS HAND IN
SHELDON ACTIVITIES
Burn Fiery Cross, Donate to
Church and Put Over School
Election
SHELDON, IA., March 15.—The
Klan has shown its presence here re
cently by several activities.
Last Monday at the school board
election, 1100 votes were polled,
which is said to be the largest num
ber in recent years. It is under
stood that the candidates favorable
to the all-American organization
were elected.
Sunday evening a delegation of
Klansmen visited the First Christian
church and left a donation, to be ap
plied to the work of the congrega
tion.
Saturday evening the community
was startled to see the burning of
a large fiery cross on a hill top.
These activities are evidence of
the fact that the Klan here is one of
the most active in northern lowa. It
is reported that it is growing in
numbers and will soon count in its
ranks the finest citizens of this town
and county.
The Klansmnn who goes to
lodge with a peevish dis|>osit ion
and a long face often finds that
the devil is walking by his side.
THE FIERY GROSS
BY A KLANSMAN
and because we chose to base our
constitution upon His Word. There
fore, the Bible having this direct re
lation, and being the fundamental
principle of our government, the
reading therefrom in any institution
that has come about through the ap
plication of the consttution cannot
be in any manner injurious to any
such institutions.
The Bible is not sectarian nor does
it teach sectarianism, sectarianism is
the fruit of the brain of man and
not inspired by God.
To become efficient in any one
thing one must understand the fun
damental principles of that thing,
whatever it may be. There can not
be found any better way of convey
ing American ideals to those who are
to become American citizens than to
permit the reading, and if you please
force such reading if need be, from
the book by which this nation came
into being. When this has come
about we will be able to assimilate
into our national life and make real
American citizens of those who come
into our country and their children.
IMMIGRATION PERILS
NATION, SAYS SPEAKER
Melting Pot Does Not Melt in
New York City, Declares
Rev. E. D. Walker
PITTSBURG, KAN., March 10.—The
splendid address on the aims and
principles of the Ku Klux Klan giv
en by the Rev. E. D. Walker, of
Wichita, during his recent visit to
Pittsburg, gave a new impetus to the
movement in Crawford county and
resulted in the addition of a large
number of members to both Klan and
the Women’s organization. Two thou
sand persons heard his address.
“The greatest peril to the freedom
of the people of the United States at
the present time is foreign immigra
tion,’’ the Rev. Mr. Walker declared.
“Foreigners coming to the United
States congregate in the large cities,
speak their own tongue, read their
own foreign publications, perpetuate
their own customs and do not try to
become Americanized.” He pointed
out the fallacy of the United States
being a melting pot. “They do not
melt, and New York is today the most
foreign city in the United States.”
The Rev. Mr. Walker, admitting
that he is a Klansman denied that
the organization is fighting the
Jews, the Catholics or the negroes.

gram has been promulgated by the
Grand Dragon of Illinois.

RICHMOND KLAN TO
BUILD CLUB HOUSE
River Site Selected for Sommer
Colony for Americans
Only
(Hy Staff Correspondent)
RICHMOND, VA.. March B.—After
being tied up in court litigation for
a period of nine months, Richmond
Klan No. 1, of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, loyal to the present re
gime of Dr. Evans and his organiza
tion, is rapidly getting on its feet
and will soon be meeting in its own
club house.
The Richmond Klan since its reor
ganization last June is rapidly ap
proaching the 1,000 membership list
and proposes to show the rest of the
country what real hustlers can ac
complish in a short time. Num
bered in its present membership is a
first-class real estate man, and
through him the organization has
taken over Recreation Park, an
amusement resort 11 miles from the
city, situated on the Chickahominy
river. It is also on an interurban
railway line, and there is mighty
fine fishing in the river at that point,
and picnic and camping grounds.
The Klan through its real estate
member has laid out 320 lots at or
adjoining Recreation Park and these
are being sold to Klan members only.
No one else can get even a look at
these fine building sites, and it is
proposed to have a regular Klan col
ony at this place. On selling the lots
the Klan comes into a deed for a
little less than eight acres on which
it is proposed to build a club house
where the Klan can hold its meet
ings, etc. This new club house is to
be fashioned like an old-fashioned log
house, and it is going to be a mighty
fine Klavern for Virginia to look up
on, and it will be the home and pride
of the Richmond Klan.
On Saturday, March 15, it has been
planned to have a wiener roast at
the site of the new club house and
further plan the new resort. Klans
men will roll up their sleeves and
help clear off the place, remove trees
and underbrush, and get ready for
the laying of the “corner stone,” as
it were. Later on when the weather
moderates a little more Klansmen
will clean out the river at Recrea
tion park and make it ready for good
boating as well as fishing.
When the Richmond Klan gets
ready to dedicate its new home it is
proposed to have Dr. Evans and oth
er nigh officials of the organization
pay Richmond a visit and do the hon
ors. That occasion will be a great
time in the history of Richmond’s
organization, and visitors will be wel
comed from all over the country.
Week beginning April 7: “The Ori
gin and Operation of the Constitu
tion of the United States.”
Week beginning April 21: “The
Klan’s Attitude Towards the Law."
Week beginning May 5: “The
Home, the Birthplace of the Nation.”
Week beginning May 19: “The Klan
as a Civic Asset.”
Week beginning June 2: “Our Pub
lic School System.”
Week beginning June 1G: “The
Dangers Confronting our Public
Schools.”
Week beginning June 30: “The
Klan’s Responsibility to the Public
Schools.”
Week beginning July 1: “Maintain
ing Our National Independence.”
Week beginning July 28: “America
for Americans.”
A series of international regional
conferences among missionary work
ers to discuss the Christian world
task are being held during March
and April in north Africa and the
Near East. Dr. John R. Mott has ac
cepted the invitation of the Interna
tional Missionary council to preside
at these meetings, the first of which
will be held in Morocco, and the last,
a general conference, In Jerusalem.
ORGANIZED MOBBERS ATTACK
SALESMEN FOR FIERY CROSS

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 8. —Eighteen salesmen for The
Minnesota Fiery Cross were attacked and threatened by an anti-
Klan mob composed mostly of Jews here tonight. Before open at
tacks were made by the mob, the men selling The Minnesota Fiery
Cross, , official Ku Klux Klan publication, were the centers of
vicious and profane insults. To the credit of the Klansmen it can
be said that they at all times conducted themselves with unusual
restraint. - - -
Shortly after the appearance of
The Fiery Cross salesmen on Henni
pin avenue, at the corners of inter
sections, Fifth street and Hennipin
avenue, Sixth street and Hennipin
avenue, Seventh street and Hennipin
avenue and Eighth street and Henni
pin avenue, there seemed to be indi
viduals, who were energetically or
ganizing groups.
The first outbreak of the “antis”
took place at Fifth street and Hen
nipin avenue. A man, obviously a
Jew, stepped up to The Fiery Cross
salesman and said, “What are you
selling?” The salesman replied, “Min
nesota Fiery Cross, a Ku Klux Klan
paper.”
Tirade of Abase
A tirade of abuse now came from
the mouth of the pedestrian. The
Fiery Cross representative ignored
entirely the profane words of insult.
Finally the Jew said, “Give me a pa
per.” The purchaser immediately
went into a near-by confectionery
store, scrutinized the paper somewhat
carefully, and registered by means of
characteristic motions and active
mouths that the Ku Klux Klan paper
was not to their liking.
After a time a group of "antis” in
the confectionery store betook them
selves to the street where the whole
gang made deliberate efforts to in
volve The Fiery Cross salesman in a
fistic battle.
As the rowdies continued their
acts of intimidation, they recruited
others of their race, who chanced to
pass by. However, failing to draw
the Klansman into an open fight, the
mob moved up Hennipin avenue to
Sixth street, where there was practi
cally a repetition of what had taken
place on the intersection of Fifth
street and Hennipin avenue.
It was noticed at this point, how
ever, that the would-be mobbers did
not approach the big husky fellows,
confining their verbal attacks to the
smaller men. Whenever individuals
of the mob found an opening to grab
papers from The Fiery Cross sales
men, they did so, and tore the pa
pers into small pieces. The mob
wearied somewhat after a time, and
moved up Hennipin avenue again,
stopping when it gained the inter
section of Seventh street.
The Fiery Cross salesmen located
on the four corners of this intersec
tion were “showered” with threats
and profane denunciations, but fol
lowed instructions by entirely ignor
ing the mobbers who were “spilling”
for a fight. After devoting 15 or 20
minutes to the Klansman selling pa
pers on Seventh street and Hennipin
avenue, the mob once more sought a
new field in its efforts to locate trou
ble. Shortly, Eighth street and Hen
nipin avenue was selected by the
mob as the plaoe for some real ac
tion.
A rowdy stepped up to a fiery
Cross salesman at this intersection
and asked for a paper. The first
thing The Fiery Cross salesman knew
a fist came into contact with his
face. Several bullies straightway
jumped on The Fiery Cross salesman,
and beat him severely.
A policeman standing not far away
rushed into the mob and forced back
many of the assailants, who were
filling the air with profanity and
threats. From every side people came
running and it wasn’t long before
thousands of people were pressing
toward the center of action. Police
men shouted to the crowd, “Get back,
get back.” In his haste the officer
of the law. after taking custody of
The Fiery Cross salesman, reached
out and got his hands on a boy, who
is alleged to have been one of the
attackers. Holding the two with a
firm grip, the policeman forced his
way to the patrol box.
The patrol wagon came and the
newspaper salesman and the Jew boy
were ordered to step into the wag
on. As The Fiery Cross salesmen en
tered the wagon, loud shouts came
from every side.
“Stick to it boy. We’re with you.
You can depend on us. Don’t let any
one scare you. We’ll soon find out

The wagon hardly started for the
central station when another Fiery
Cross salesman was attacked and was
severely beaten. Quick work on the
part of the police broke up one
group of attackers after another,
but within a half an hour things
quieted down. Yet there was more
or less “milling” around until an
early hour of the morning.
Some Comedy Seen
It seems that every tragedy has its
comedy, and Saturday night on Hen
nipin avenue with the mob in action
was no exception. A foreigner came
up to a Fiery Cross salesman and
stood glaring at him for several min
utes, then planted his feet for a
“round house swing.” The Klansman
watched every move of the stranger,
and when the “swing” was released,
side-stepped. The assailant’s fist
crashed into a mail box. Thrice he
repeated the "swings” and everyone
was a miss. Then the Klansman said,
smilingly, “What’s the matter, mis
ter, are you fighting butterflies, or
something.”
In spite of Saturday night’s anti-
Klan mob activities on Hennipin
avenue, The Minnesota Fiery Cross
will be sold in Minneapolis. Hun
dreds of Protestants who were pres
ent at the scene demanded that
something be done to safeguard the
rights of Americans. Thousands of
Minneapolitans are determined in
their stand for a city free from anti-
Protestant mobs such as “ran wild”
here tonight.
In passing we might say that If
Mr. Fall’s middle name Is Bacon, no
wonder he brought It home.
