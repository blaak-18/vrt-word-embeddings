The nunprecedented enecess with which
the Times has nmet, since its establish
ment, is convincing evidence that the
people of the West and South, fully ap
preciate the efforts of a journal, which,
in addition to its enterprise as a news
paper, hasthe courage to boldly declare
and constantly maintain the principles
of its political faith.
The puhlic journal mostly deserving of
lDemocratic- support is the one that, in
addlition to being a full and faithful and
consistent advocate of Democratic prin
..iples. A Democratic newspaper is the
3eqnpaPer for Demoeratns to support, andt
se idea sometimes sought to be lucilea
ted by those who have an interestof their
own in doing so that the people nmat go
tntside their party orgaln to "find the
news," is absurd arnd irritional. There
ib no sort of incompatibility whatever
between the political and non-political
journal as to the matter of news; lalitny
of the papers rnow publishei thI; onghoaut
thie eontry, mnd esjiecially valuable for
.heiamunast and variety of their intel
ii~enee, eingg also known fotr thie ability
and aearematltess withl which they cham
ron their peculiar party views. "Hence
all tlhing else being equIal, it is manifest
ly the daty of Democrats to littit their
newspaper patroliage to such as are of
thetir ow way of timiuking, and nat to
arratler their means on those tluat Wage

hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the lpolitical and social slamen by its
masterly cartoons 11and punigent ceditorials,
it achievetd event g'reater success than

Iu its literary de1paatmeuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, hy the bt rous, ly til bist lllorous, satirical.
and character writers in tile United
