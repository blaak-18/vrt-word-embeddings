THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE
AND A FEW LACONICS
By L. A. L.
NOT “REACTION AGAINST PRO
HIBITION.”
Under the caption, “Reaction
against Prohibition,’’ the Birming
ham Age-Herald recently had an edi
torial which said, in part:
“There is a distinct reaction against
State-wide prohibition and sumptu
ary legislation in general. This re
action is as much in evidence, in
deed, as is the reaction against Al
drichism and Cannonism in the Re
publican party. Both were inevit
able. Had the Anti-Saloon League,
which is responsible for all the dras
tic prohibition measures that have
been enacted into law or that have
been proposed, pursued a moderate
policy the temperance cause would
have been benefited and the league
would have been regarded with favor
by thousands of conservative men
who now look upon it as a menace to
personal liberty and an enemy of the
democracy.”
The editorial states further that
a prohibition law, such as was “forc
ed” on Alabama, is intolerable. Vir
ginia, Maryland, and Florida had, a
year or more ago, shown decided
signs of joining the “prohibition”
States, but the two former rejected
an amendment, and Florida will de
cide the coming November.
Prohibition has lost caste for the
simple reason it does not prohibit li
quor traffic.
Georgia is one of the best exam
ples of the fallacy of the law as a
law. The sale of “near-beer” is so
large that investigation might prove
it such close kin to its second name
as to warrant the dropping of the
prefix.
The inter-state traffic between
Georgia and Florida has reached
gigantic proportions.
Open, public sales of liquor seized
by the United States Government
are held on Atlanta’s streets, in the
shadow of the postoffice.
There is no possibility of calling
prohibition such, where these viola
tions are possible.
Many an honest, earnest man and
woman whose lives have been made
tragic wrecks because of the curse
of drunkenness under which some
one near to them has suffered, would
willingly give the rest of their lives
to helping make “prohibition law”
a reality. But in large numbers they
are the ones who realize most fully
the folly of classing a State as “pro
hibition” ruled when interstate traf
fic and “legal” sales will permit the
victims of drink to secure all they
may want, at such frequent oppor
tunities.

Young man in Atlanta fancied his

As though it wasn’t bad enough to
realize we were eating eggs whose

Many a bill has had hard sledding
at this session of Congress. The pro
posed railroad bill was the latest to
get the icy stare, the frozen hand and
the marble heart. And the bill had
the august approval of the Chief
Executive himself. How times
change!

A county in Indiana takes the
prize for economy. The jail had
only one prisoner, a man charged
with wife murder, and “opinion was
divided as to whether it was worth
while to go to the expense of a sec

liberated.

The Chinese are doing their best

Nice, isn’t it?

’Member that little dot on the

all this dense silence, those wretched

thought of losing it.

The Governor of Tennessee is com

controversy which has ensued.

Pity the poor Census Enumerator.
Reports are being filed wherein is
shown that many “ladies” have
“slammed doors in the faces of enu
merators”, and they (the C. E.’s),
plaintively ask for instructions. Let
’em write all those females down as
“past fifty”, and see how that will
work.

Vice-President Sherman has de
clared himself in favor of an even
higher protective tariff, and urges
business men to give the present one
a fair trial. As many have “gone
broke” trying to live under it, a
waiting world would welcome Mr.
Sherman’s honest opinion as to the
duration of a “fair” trial.

If anything can comfort the
American people for the high prices
they are paying for food, some of the
explanations being offered may fill
the bill. We are assured from
Washington that “short-weight pack
ages and secret agreements between
merchants” are largely to blame.
But this explanation, like many
others, calls for a diagram.

Before next winter it would be a
good idea if some rampant women
agitators would agitate for an inter
national law to compel housewives
to put fenders in front of open fire
places. The number of little chil
dren and aged people burned to
death in the winter of 1909-10,
whose clothing had caught from the
open fireplaces, is appalling.

Uncle Samuel has taken hold of
bankruptcy matters, relative to the
operations of a number of swindling
concerns who established business
houses, bought heavily in jewelry,
and “failed” at the psychological mo
ment, disappearing after a “settle
ment,” only to reappear at another
point, and U. S. thinks getting money
this way was too easy to be encour
aged.

The ’peculiar phase of the trial of
Dr. Hyde, in Kansas City, Missouri,
is that of a house divided against
itself. Dr. Hyde’s wife was a Miss
Swope, and she has clung to her
husband, turning against her mother
and sisters. A more thorough ex
ample of “the wretchedness of rich
es” could scarcely be found in a
day’s search. Greed for money is
supposed to be the motive for the
alleged murders.
Extracts From Correspondents
Which We Appreciate
Emory J. Moon, R. F. JD. 2, Mount
ville, Ga.
I am not a new subscriber to your
paper, in away, for I have always
been an eager purchaser of your pa
pers at the news-stands, but now that
I have gone “back to the farm” I
shall have to enlist with you.
You are doing a great, a wonder
ful reform service for our country,
and here’s one wishing you many
years of continued success.
J. W. Shull, Romney, W. Va.
I wish every voter in the land
could read the Magazine for one
year,—then there would be no trou
ble about getting the reforms you
advocate and are so eloquently plead
ing for. I am with you on Foreign
Missions, Brothers Wakefield and
Corey notwithstanding.
A. J. Moore, Comanche, Texas.
I am well pleased with the way
you are handling the Foreign Mission
question, and the fanatics on Social
ism. We have some Baptist brethren
out here that will say that one can
not live a Christian life unless he is
a Socialist.
I will try to get you some sub
scribers, for I am contending for the
same old Populist doctrines that are
set forth in the Jeffersonians.
R. F. Hicks, Roberta, Ga.
I would # give more for the weekly
Jeffersonian than I would for any
daily paper in Georgia, or any other
State. I pity the man who is so
prejudiced that his child is deprived
of the valuable privilege of reading
such literature as the two Jefferson
ians.
C. E. Gilmer, Dixie, Ga. »
I have received my Watson knife
as a premium, and I am well pleased
with it. I show it everywhere I go,
and tell folks how to get one like it.
I want to tell you how well I like the
Weekly. I prize it more than any
paper I take. Your editorials are
good. I have been keeping up with
your views on Foreign Missions, and
I agree with you.
J. D. Hinson, Hinsonton, Ga.
I have been reading your litera
ture since the early nineties, and am
glad to know that I have been the
cause of a few others thinking that
you are right on most all questions
that you champion by furnishing
them your literature. Through you
is about the only way that we, the
common people, can get the facts
about our governmental affairs. I
sincerely hope that you may be able
to serve us for many years to come.
J. S. Norris, Warthen, Ga.
I have read after you a long time,
and many of your articles have stir
red my soul to its depths. “To This
Noble Woman I Doff My Hat”, in the
weekly of November 25th, is a mas
terpiece, containing unanswerable
facts that ought to wake up those
who are dead in sin and trespasses.
Accept my thanks for the advice
given to the Farmers’ Union. I am
a member of that order, and I fully
agree with you on all you have writ
ten about it.
If you want Real enjoyment, send
ten cents for a copy of Humorist.
