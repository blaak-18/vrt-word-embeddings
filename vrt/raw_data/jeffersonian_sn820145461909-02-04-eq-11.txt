Heart
Troubles
The heart may be weaE
just the same as the eyes,
stomach or other organs.
It often happens that a
person is bom with a weak
heart. Then again dis
ease, fevers, over-exertion,
anxiety, nervousness,
rheumatism, etc. weaken
the heart. The result is
shortness of breath, pal
pitation, pain in the heart,
or in some of the nerves
of the chest or abdomen.
The heart should be
strengthened with a tonic,
and for this nothing equals
Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure.
x ,‘T had I-a Grippe last fall as I
thought in a mild form. I was weak,
tired feeling, and short of breath:
could hardly go about, and a good
deal of the time sort of an asthmatic
breathing and extremely nervous. I
began taking Dr. Miles’ Heart Cure
and Nervine and now I feel so much
better in every way. I am so thank
ful that I began taking this medicine,
and shall not hesitate to tell others
how much good it has done me.”

Our Post-Card Club
By Daddy Jim.
We have received many bright and
pleasant letters from the boys and
girls who read the Jeffersonian. It
will be hard to pick the boy and the
girl who shall win the prizes, but we
will publish their names next week,
and will also publish the best of the
letters.
A Watch for the Boys.
To the boy under fifteen years old
who will send us the neatest, bright
est and most manly letter in the next
two weeks we will give a good watch
in a silverine case, stem-wind and
stem-set, that will keep excellent time.
Letters must contain not more than
fifty words, and must be received at
this office not later than February 18.
All letters must be addressed to the
Jeffersonian Post Card Club, Thom
son, Ga.
The second prize for the boys, un
der the same conditions, will be fifty
post cards, all different, and all worth
having.
A Ring for the Girls.
To the girl under fifteen years of
age who will send us the daintiest,
sweetest and happiest letter in the
next two weeks we will give a pretty
gold ring, set with pearls, of which
she will be proud. Don’t write more
than 50 words—not even 51 —and mail
your letter so that we will get it by
the 18th of February. Address your
envelope to the Jeffersonian Post Card
Club, Thomson, Ga.
The second prize for the girls, un
der the same conditions, will be fifty
charming post cards, the best that are
made.
On Your Honor.
Os course you will write these let
ters all by yourselves, without any
help. Cross your heart, you will,
won’t you? Don’t get things out of
books, and don’t slop over. Just be
natural and every-day, as if you were
talking to Daddy Jim over the supper
table at night, telling him all about
what happened during the clay. Don’t
dress up in your Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes, and be stiff and starched so
that people can hear you crackle and
creak while you seat yourself and
take your pen in hand, and all that
kind of thing, but come along in your
old jeans, with your pockets full of
marbles and fish-hooks, if you are
boys; and if you are girls, we want to
see you dancing and laughing and
playing, as you do when you come out
of school. ' -
It’s for You.
This post card club is for all boys
and girls, anywhere in the world, who
like post cards and all other things
that are bright and happy —flowers
and birds; the hot sunshine and the
cool moonlight; music and pictures
and song; games, strength, bravery,
and the gentleness that goes with it.
It Costs Money.
Now, all of you can understand that
it takes money to give prizes, and it
takes time to read your letters and
find out which is the best, if you
want to belong to this Post Card Club,
and have your letters printed (when
they are good), and get a lot of fun
and some prizes out of it, you must
do a little work for us. You must tell
your schoolmates and playmates and
other children about the club and the
post cards, and show them how to take
TJtffersonlan
subscriptions for the Jeffersonian, so
that they can get post cards for them
selves.
You Scratch
my back and I’ll scratch yours. That’s
the idea. We’ll give you a chance to
have all the fun you like out of the
post cards and these letters to the pa
per, and we’ll show you how to write
good letters, so that you can win nice
prizes, if you will talk about the Jef
fersonian Post Card Club to every
boy and girl you know. When you
write to other little friends, tell them
about the cards.
Remember!
If you will get up a club of seven
subscribers to the Jeffersonian and
Up-to-Date Farming at 25 cents each,
we will send you fifty beautiful post
cards as a reward, all free. If you
get three more subscribers, we will
send you another set of cards, called
U A Trip Around the World With
Uncle Sam’s Battle Ships,” fifty
cards in colors, showing the noted
places that the fleet visited, with a
map of the route, and pictures of all
the ships and the sailor boys at work
and at play. And each one of the sub
scribers will get 20 cards, all differ
ent.
If you will get up a club of seven
subscribers at 50 cents each, we will
send you by return mail the fifty
“Tour of the World” cards, as ad
vertised on another page of this pa
per. Read all about them, and then go
to work and hustle for subscribers.
SHE WAS FIRST.
A woman slipped a dime into her
glove on her left hand. She would be
at the subway in a moment, and the
dime so placed would facilitate mat
ters. As she passed the foot of the
bridge extension by the city hall the
ring of a coin as it struck the pave
ment, reached her ears. She saw a
dime rolling at her feet.
A fat man, subway bound, also
heard and saw it. Both stopped to
pick it up. She was first. His hand
only fanned the dust from the side
walk.
“I beg your pardon,” he said, as he
straightened up, rather red in the
face.
“Not at all,” she said. “I thank
you for your courtesy.” Then she
hurried down the stairs.
Seated in an express train, her
gloved hand involuntarily went up to
her hair. A dime' dropped in her lap.
Then she understood.
Outside, the fat man slowly closed
his mouth. Then he hit Broadway in
a northerly direction. —New York
