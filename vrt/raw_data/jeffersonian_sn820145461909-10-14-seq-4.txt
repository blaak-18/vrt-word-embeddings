Summary of Events
Mr. Taft has been occupying pul
pits and preaching a good deal of late.
As pulpiteer, he fully equals
Mr. Taft himself as statesman and
Preaches displays the same childlike
and beautiful inconsistencies. Speak
ing to the Mormons, he delivered one
of his nice lectures aimed against the
muckrakers in general, and bespeak
ing for those who differ from us po
litically a magnanimous interpreta
tion of motives. Queer that he se
lected the bailiwick of Reed Smoot
for this, instead of the home of those
senators whom he read out of the
party in his tour of the Middle West,
is it not? Mr. Smoot’s motives in
fagging for Cannon were doubtless
of the purest and most exalted sort.
M about the same date, Mr. Taft
addressed some Roman Catholic chil
dren, and unctiously informed them
that loyalty to the church was loyalty
to the government. It would be an in
teresting psychological study to fol
low the process by which “loyalty’ to
an hierarchy whose absolute head is
an Italian politician can be loyalty to
t e American democracy, whose foun
dations are the sovereignty of the
people and religious freedom, to
neither of which tenets has the Cath
olic church ever subscribed.
“Continuing on,” Mr. Taft is fur
ther quoted as saying he favored any
church which promoted “true moral
ity.” This is another fascinating
ambiguity. As long as humanity dif
fers in its ideas as to what consti
tutes “true morality” there is cer
tain to be wide variance in the
churches, though we don’t any more
torture and slay those whose “true
morality” may not work out just the
same as the “true morality” of our
own particular brand. When Christ
rebuked the Pharisees, he doubtless
reproved some “truly moral” men.
who got their money as “legally” as
Rockefeller claims to have gotten his,
and who would have made quite as
excellent Sunday-school teachers.
What we need is more Christlikeness
both inside and outside the churches.
Shortly ago, Mr. Watson comment
ed on a speech made by Taft wherein
the President alluded to the stay-at
home as a “lunkhead.” Following
this, he states as main reason why
the people of Alaska are “incapable
of self-government”, that they are
“too nomadtc.” Obviously, then, ac
cording to Taft’s reasoning, the
“lunkhead” should have voice in af
fairs, while those who have traveled
should be disfranchised. The Alask
ans demanding statehood are nothing
more than American citizens who
have colonized that region, who are
developing it, and who naturally de
sire to manage it themselves. Put
ting them under territorial restric
tions at present is an inexcusable in
justice.

not continue in this blissfully primi
tive state long. The patrons them
selves will begin slyly to demoralize
it, for it is snobbery, not conscience,
that in these days “makes cowards
of us all.”

that was to puncture the Cook tire.
Meanwhile, pole or no pole, the
Brooklyn doctor is having all the fun,
anyhow, and raking in the lecture
money.

lowa and the corn-grow

to send beans; the rice-growing States
to send rice, and the Eastern States,
blankets, clothing, etc. This is a
lovely thought, by which rich Mexico
could be relieved from the necessity
of caring for her own unfortunates
altogether. But we have a better plan
than that; suppose the corn and
wheat-growing States send carloads
of food to the wretched, starving peo
ple of the East, while the manufac
turers of that region hand out a few
blankets and garments to the im
poverished, unemployed wretches of
our country, etc. There will be more
suffering in America the first cold
“snap” than the Mexican peons ever
knew.
And so they are going to close
down the cotton-mills North and
South and throw out of employment
thousands of poor hands. There will
be plenty of charity needed right
at home, without sending food and
clothing to people in tropical re
gions.

lican administration, yet it is rather
piling it on when he declares his
intention to plead the case of the
Illinois Central Railroad, defend
ant to the suit brought against it by
Illinois, before the Supreme Court of
that State. It is not in the least
material whether this case does, or
does not, involve any phase of gov
ernmental control of railroads, rate
making, or what not. The specta
cle of a Cabinet officer acting as
corporation attorney and giving, for
a fee, not only what skill he may
possess as an attorney, but his newly
acquired prestige as a government
official, is offensive to that ideal con
duct which all right-thinking per
sons prescribe for men in his position.
In the first place, Mr. Dickinson is the
paid servant of the people, the only
difference, that he is employed by
them through the selection of Mr.
Taft instead of election. Acceptance
of the appointment was equivalent
to a contract to work in the public
service—and none other. If that
meant financial sacrifice to him, he
should have accepted the condition,
or refused the offer. Having ac
accepted, his time is not his own
to use in preparation and pleading
of law cases, or any other private
project, but belongs to his depart
ment of government service. Be
sides this, it is plain that the per
sonality of a celebrity carries its
strong influence, aside from the mer
its of the case he presents. This
should not be so, but it IS
so, and, unfortunately, only too
many people are victims of this form
of cheap hero worship, or worship
of cheap heroes, whichever you may
please.
If a postal clerk, on a small sala
ry, with considerable leisure, or a
good deal of energy, kept books for
a private firm or engaged in any oth
er form of extra work, he’d prompt
ly lose his job. There is good reason
for this, because the government
would not care to have overtired,
indifferent postal service, and al
though this might work hardship to
an occasional individual, it is a wise
rule that holds it against public pol
icy for a government employee to
enter competition with those who
have not such light hours and regu
lar, presumably sufficient, salaries;
as well as to insure that men and
women in the service should come
to their work properly rested, re
freshed, and free from the distrac-

tion of attention inevitable should
other gainful pursuits also be fol
lowed. But why should a Cabinet
officer be held exempt, and turned
out to help State political campaigns,
or anything that they, or a partisan
executive, may please? The Presi
dent has no right, morally, to be
dashing about the country, trying to
form public opinion in favor of “his
policies,” banqueting, sight-seeing
and posing as a “ruler.” There is
plenty of business in Washington, D.
C., for any president to do, trying
to carry out the pledges of the plat
form to which he subscribed before
bis election, and which the majority
of the voters, by their ballots, ap
proved. If he can not do this, let
him apologize, justify, etc., from his
place of duty. He is no less a gov
ernment employee than is the hum
blest in the ranks. The responsibil
ity upon President and high officials
is greater, but the ethics of the case
should be as binding on these men
higher up as upon the fellows in the
ranks.

country in which to practice the use
of the German tongue. You will at
once notice a great difficulty, how
ever, in finding anyone to talk Ger
man to you. As soon as you address
a German in his language, he will at
once answer you in English in order
to make it easier for you. You can
remedy this by going to a tourist ho
tel filled with American travelers.
Here nothing but German will be
spoken and yot can practice to your
lieart’s content.
Traveling on German trains is an
art which can not be acquired in
one trip. The fares average two
cents a mile, and the fines $5 a trip.
The only safe way to travel is to do
nothing at all while on board the
cars. This will save you from being
fined except for being in the wrong
compartment, which is not possible
to avoid, as there are no right com
partments.
E’erators in German hotels should
be used carefully and with fore
thought. If you are on the third
floor you will generally find it pos
sible to get to the ground floor by
e’evator in time for your meals.
Above the third floor always start
down for lunch after breakfast, and
for dinner after lunch. Old travel
ers, when ascending to their rooms,
often vary the monotony by riding
one story on the elevator, then get
ting out and walking a story, and
then riding another story. The new
er German elevators are equipped
with restaurants and card-tables,
thus making them much more prac
ticable.
No matter how clean you are when
you see Berlin, you will instinctively
wish for a bathtub. This, in order to

manicured, every day. Wipe your
feet on the curbstone before cross
ing the street in order not to soil the
pavement.—Literary Magazine.
