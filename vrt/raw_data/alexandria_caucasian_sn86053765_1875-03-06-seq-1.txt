'Twas n lowly Summe r morning
in tlio year of 0,001 beforo lîhript/
Tlio woods of Stencganihia woro
clothed in their fairest costume ;
tlio lowly birds were chirping and
singing tlieir morning lays; tlio
sky whs one vast slit et ot blue«;
everything, in short, was full of
sweetness and light, except tho
loved y Lady Adeliza de Chimpan
zee. She was in tho, dnmjv,
Moodily she rubbed her shoulders
ngninst a huge palm-tree, and
while performing this act heaved a
vast sigh. Just at that moment
her mamma dropped from tho tree
above lier.
"My daughter," said the Duchess
de Chimpanzee, "why that sigh?"
"Ah, mamma, look at, me," sind
Lady Adeliza. *'See how different
I am from the rest ot our tribe.
Leo how whito I am becoming."
"My daughter," said the Duch
ess languidly, as she seated herself
on a convenient bowlder, "You
should be proud of the diiierenco.
Wo aro a higher race.'"
"I don't know, mamma. Seo
what little caudal appendages wo
have ; all the other folks can linng
from« the trees by their tails, but wo
arc compelled to sit on the limbs."
"We aro advancing, my~deai*.
You are whiter than Iain ; yon can
talk in your youth, I could not till
middle age; your grandmother, an
you know, can only grant it. You
are moving to a higher sphere."
"Well, mamma, none of our folks
will marry me," said lady Adellza,
pouting.
"îno, my child; it has been de
creed that there should be a selee,
tion ot the fittest in marriage. Wo
have, offered you to the I'rinco
d'Ourarig Ontang, who is even whi
ter than you are, as a wife."
"Oh, mamma," gushed the Lady
Adeliza, that's splendid. WIM be
came soon V
"Restrain yourself. People of
high lilood ami short caudal appen
dages never get exeited. lie will
be here in a short time.
Lady Adeiiza went away to look
for cocoa nuts ; and tlio Duchess sat
on the rock, and rciloctively scratch,
ed her head.

ruled, many of the neighboring
tribes desired to marry her. IL-r
parents, however, desired that she
should be, if possible, the fountain
head of tho new race to which all
tlieir traditions told them they
were working up. They determin
ed that she should wed the Prince
d'On ran g Ontang. The Duke pro.
posed the matter to the Prince.
"Aw .'"said the Prince, as ho ad
justed Iiis eye glass, "Ls it nice ?"
"She is beautiful," replied tho
Duke.
"Au !" said the T'rince, "give it
—aw—much stamps?"
"I shall give her all Ethiopia,"
replied the I)uke.
"I will—aw step down, and aw
look at it," murmured tho Prince,
carelessly. I»y surprise, you know."
This was agreed upon, and tho

The Prince knew his worth; ho
