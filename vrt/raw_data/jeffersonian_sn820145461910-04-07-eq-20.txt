The Real Remedy for the White
Slave Traffic
(A Paper read by Henry William
Rose before the regular meeting of
the Fulton County Medical Society,
at Carnegie Library, Atlanta, Geor
gia, February 17. 1910.)
We need waste no time dwelling
upon the urgent need of some steps
being taken to counteract the ac
tivity of the powers of darkness, as
usually referred to by the term
White Slave Traffic. We must give
attention to the preventive measures
which will be calculated to shield
and safeguard the boys and girls of
today, who will very shortly grow
into the men and women of tomor
row. Are they to be sacrificed on the
altar of silence and ignorance, fos
tered by conniving guardians of the
public weal? No; emphatically not.
The hour has come when something
must be done; and it is actually be
ing begun. A well-known magazine
for women has for some years been
arguing persistently that the chil
dren must be instructed as to whence
they came and how they got here.
True, some parents will protest; but
what of that? Let them protest: it
will be of no avail, for when the
State says instruction must be given,
it will be given, parents’ consent or
not disregarded.
In the school books on hygiene
there should be included a brief
chapter dealing with the reproduc
tive organs. Every boy and girl
should be taught that there lies
ahead the glorious possibility and
responsibility, yes, and even duty, of
parenthood. Suitable and proper
teaching must be imparted, such as
will lead every child to respect and
revere the whole of the human
anatomy. This will inevitably re
sult in a more general and accepted
standard of physical care, induced by
the seriousness of the need of care
ful living. Too long have we allowed
our youths to be given the impres
sion that wild oats are a necessary
evil. It is time to stop this notion
getting into the heads of the boys of
the land. And girls must be prepar
ed for womanhood by being taught
the physical changes which accom
pany puberty. Unless we do teach
these things to our children, we may
continue to look for a harvest of
sterility, and race suicide, venereal
disease, and all their dire and dread
ful consequences.
We are responsible for the future
welfare of our youth. Shall we stand
supinely by and look on indifferently,
the while they are being swept down
the road to ruin, simply because no
one will give a word of sympathetic
warning? But signs are appearing
over the social horizon which indi
cate that the nation is awaking, and
Obe
that we are at last beginning to
emerge from our fifth-century stu
pidity, and coming to realize that IN
STRUCTION IN VITAL MATTERS
IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE,
and must be included in the curric
ula of the public schools.
The call goes forth—who will rise
and respond? Who will introduce
into the Legislature a bill demand
ing that such instruction shall be
given in every school? We must
throw off our yokes of thraldom to
false modesty and sham delicacy, for
the welfare of the race cries to
Heaven, the blood of the innocent
victims of parental silence wails from
the ground of our common humani
ty. Where are the men and women
who will start the wheels revolving,
and see to it that the State decrees
that the boys and girls shall be in
structed in parentage and fitted
therefor?
New Party Needed
Since Mr. Taft has decided to re
ceive the blessings of the great
American Octopus, with its head in
Wall street, on the one hand, and the
curses of the people on the other;
therefore we deem it about time to
start a new party; and, since mo
nopoly has been the curse of the
ages; and since the two old parties
have become too hardened in crime
for reform, we would suggest the fol
lowing name for the new party,
ANTI-MONOPOL, with the following
planks for platform:
1. The protection of human rights,
and the setting of bounds and limits
to human greed.
2. That occupancy and use, in
limited quantity, should constitute
the right to houses and lands, to the
end that all might get homes.
3. That we should have Govern
ment banks and Government money
in lieu of our present double-geared,
usury, corporation debt, bank note,
bank credit system.
4. That the money of the country
should be deemed the common prop
erty of the whole people, the same as
their mail bags , ships and munitions
of war; and, when loaned, interest
should accrue to the common fund.
5. That the public lands should be
sold only to actual sttlers in limited
quantity.
6. That alien ownership of land,
and alien investments in every form,
should be prohibited by an amend
ment to the Constitution.
7. That the railroads should be
long to the Government as fast as
they can be acquired. And that other
public utilities should belong to the
public.
8. That since a national debt is
not a necessity, it should be pro
hibited by an amendment of the Con
stitution.
9. That the cash system should be
established between man and man;
and the credit system abolished —so
far as such an attainment is possible
—to the end that litigation may be
reduced to the minimum.
10. That we should not import a
scion of the house of King Edward to
rule over us—lest we become so
“English, yo’ know, so English’’—as
to have twenty-five thousand land
lords to forty million tenant-slaves.
Now, Mr. Editor, start the ball to
rolling on this line and hoop’er up,
and the peasantry, the rank and file,
will fall in line at a rate the dreamer
never dreamed of.
Respectfully yours,
J. B. CONSER.
