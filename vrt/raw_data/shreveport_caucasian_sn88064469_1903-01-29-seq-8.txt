Shreveport.
An' interesting meeting of ladies was
ield in the parlor of the Athletic Club
Friday at which there was considered
he organization of a civic league. The
ssemblage was called to order at Ixl
em. by Mrs. John Shuttleworth. Mrs.
E. B. Rand was secretary. Among the
representative' ladies of various clubs
were Mayor Querbes and several mem
ers of the city council, Dr. J. C. Egan
ud Hon. J. H. Shepherd. Over the
aleeing Miss Lavinia Egan. named as
president, presided. The proposed con
stitution and by-laws was outlined by
Mrs. Shuttleworth. The organization is
to be known as the City Improvement
League. Its purpose is to unite all citi
zens in a betterment of the city in all
its phases and conditions. The league
propose to use its full influence towards
the enforcement of all ordinances which
will lead to cleaner and better streets
and sidewalks and which will make the
city healthier and more attractive. As
said a charming lady friend of the
Caucasian: "When our league is fully
organized you will not see on the side
walks and streets 'dodgers' and hand
bills and waste paper scattered about;
everything will be clean;" added the
rdy with enthusiasm, and the Caucasian
ian politely rejoined: "And the ladies,
I prsemy , will also keep eyes on the
enetad # make them walk a -chalk line,"
ai which our friend nodded `approvingly
and smaied. herself away.

Expected Not Far From the Last of

(Copyrighted 1903 by W. T. Foster.)
St. Joseph, Mo., Jan. z4. -Last bulle
tin gave forecasts of disturbance to
cross continent January 28 to February
I, warm wave 27 to 31, cool wave 30 to
February 3.
Next disturbance will reach the Pa
cific coast about February 2, cross west
of the Rockies by close of 3, great cen
tral valleys 4 to 6, eastern states 7.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies abouwt February 2, great cen
tral valleys 4, eastern states 6. Cool
wave will cross west of Rockies about
February 5, great central valleys Feb
ruary 7, eastern states 9.
Temperature of the week ending Feb
ruary 2 will average below normal in the
northwest, below in southwest, above
normal on Pacific coast, below in Ohio
valley, lake region and northeastern
states, and about normal in southeastern
states. Rainfall will be above normal in
southwest, below in southeast, about in
northeast, above normal in northwest
and below on Pacific slope.
Immediately following date of this
bulletin moderate temperatures will pre
vail in northwest and southwest, while
temperature will be normal on Pacific
slope, moderate in Ohio valley, about
great lakes and in northeastern states,
normal in southeastern states. *
I am expecting a riprorous blizzard
not far from the las' of January accom
panied by all the disagreeable and ex
pensive accompaniments. Old Boreas,
whose headquarters are on Bothia
island at 70 north and 91 west, where
the magnetic needle stands on its head,
seems to have prolonged his New Yea'
hilarities permitting that cold wave to
run riot, but it may be that he is angry
at us; at least I would advise all to be
prepared for the worst as we approach
. the coming month.
February temperature will make a line
, like a rainbow, high in the middle and
low at both ends. The month will come
in and go out with general cold waves,
. severe and stormy weather.
. But the middle part of the i nth will
I be wfrm enough to make the month
- average about normal.
Draw a line from Chicago, by way of
SSt. Louis and Little Rock, to Houston,
- Tex., and the weather changes will reach
t that line within a4 hours of 8 p.m. of
- dates given below. One day earlier the
' same changes will reach a line drawn
through Winnipeg, Huron, Denver and

cross a line drawn through Swift Cur

,olonel Arthur Lynch Is Adjudged
Guilty of Treason.
PROSECUTOR SEVERE
En His Reply to the Defense Solicitor
General Carson Asserted Act of
Defendant Was of a Cows
ardly Character.
London. Jan. 24.-Colonel Arthur
Lynch was found guilty and sentenced
o death.
Counsel for defense made no attempt
to deny that Colonel Lynch supported
the Boers, but contended that his na
tudalization was in, no way prompted
by treasonable intent, and was solely
for the advantage he would thus se
cure for journalistic purposes. Subse
quently defendant actively supported
the Boer cause in the belief that he was
a legally naturalized burgher.
Replying for the pdosecution, Solic
itor General Sir Edward Carson main
tained that Colonel Lynch joined the
Boer army as a discontented Irishman,
COLONaL, ArTUR LYCS
thereby committing a most cowardly
and most serious act of treason. His
naturalization, continued the solicitor
general, was only a flimsy pretext.
Counsel then proceeded to detail the
prisoner's alleged acts of adherence to
his country's enemies.
Lord chief justice summed up very
briefly. He said that if in war British
subjects joined the king's enemies,
whatever his purpose, he was guilty of
unlawful act.
Naturalisation during war time af
forded no excuse whatever for subse
quent acts.
There was abundant evidence, he
said, of overt acts in aiding the king's
enemies.
The Jury, after having been out half
an hour, returned a verdict of guilty.
When asked if be had anything to say
as to why he should not be sentenced
to death, Colonel Lynch replied.
'"Thaank you; I will say nothing." Sen
tence of death was passed on each of
the four counts in the indictment The
prisoner then bowed to the court and
was removed.
