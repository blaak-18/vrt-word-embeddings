A TEIRRIII E RETRIBUTIOuN.
In In le \VIids of Southerin Ten- ja
iti 4-sI-a Sledrvler's horrible 1
late-al tell-tale piece of elvet C
-a 1 mnautifil girl's sinister Oath. a
"Stop "
"\\ ho are yoiu P" II
"You don't know me f" f
<\o." I1
'Yes, you do."
"Let go of my horse, or I'll give
you a taste of my riding-whip." I
The two persons between whom a
these startling words were exchanged, c
in the woods near Chattanooga, Ten
nessee, on the 17th of July, 1846, lI
were iniddle-anged mnien.
One of them was mounts on at
very fine black hprse. HIe was ele
gantly dressed, and wore a heavy c
golden wa:tch-chain. His face was
decidedly handsome, and evety thing E
about lim indicated that lie was en- t
dowed with extraordinary bodily r
strength. His gray eyes were large
and lustrous, but there was an un- e
pleasant lurking expressing in them. c
The other man, who had seized the
bridle of his interlocutor's horse, a
woe a foreign looking costume. His
swarthy face was sunburnt and fur
rowed, and his black hair was streak
ed with gray. His eyes were small,
dark and piercing. t
Ho responded to the before-men
tioned thieat by a laugh. I
"Really, Dick Money," he exclaim
ed, "it is not very haidsome in you C
to receive your old friend Barney 1
Fields in this manner." t
These words caused Money to t
TURN VERY PALE.
For a moment his cousternation
seemed to render him speechless.
Then he faltered out:
"Yes, I recognize you now, Fields. I
What do you want of nime "
"G tioss!2
"GHow can I guess it?"
Fields replied in a stern voice: I
"I have to punish you !"
"Punish me for what ?" asked Mo
ney, anxiously.
"By George, Money, .you are the
most impudent man I ever saw. Have I
you forgotten my sister Ellen ?"
eMoney dropped his eyes. Then he
suddenly jerked the bridle out of
Fields hands and galloped off in an
opposite direction.
But he did not proceed far.
Fields drew from his belt a large
pistol, which he fired at Money. The
latter fell from his horse, which stood
still, while his master lay writhing
with pain on the ground.
The bulhet had shattered his right
leg.
In a few minutes Fields was by his
side. 1
"Have mercy on me, Fields,' cried
the wounded man, despairiDgly. "If I
you want to revenge yourself upon
me, remember that I have a yonung
daughter, Anna Bella, who loves me
so well that the news of my death
would kill her."
"Maybe the unborn babe of my
sister Ellen, whom you seduced, and
who, in consequence of your heart
lessness and infamy,
COMMITTED SUICIDE,
e Would have been a girl, too."
"Oh, my God! what do you intend
I- to do with me 7"
- "I intend to cit your throat, infer
g nal villain, who ruined our whole
family !"
r. So saying, be drew his bowie-knife
a and carried his terrible threat into
i- execution.
'- The blood poured in torrents from
R the terrible gash which Fields had
- made in his victim's neck.
Money made a few convulsive
movements and expired.
For a minute or two the murderer
looked steadily at the inanimate form
of the man who had so cruelly wrong
w ed his sister, broken up his family,
- and even gone so far in his insolence
as to purchase the Field's farm, which
was adjoining his own extensive
'* plantation.
ra "He is dead now !" muttered Fields.
f- "My appearance is so greatly chang
s. ed that no one will recognize me in
se Chattanooga. In a day or two I shall
go there, and then try to marry Anna
Bella Money. I am rich enough to
dazzle her by presents, for I hear she
is as vain as she is beautiful. But
first I shall have to drive this infernal
beast away."
He turned to the horse, which
stood as if spell-bound by the murder
of its master.
Fields kicked it, but the spirited
animal bit at him and tore from his
sleeve
A SMALL PIECE OF THE VELVET
From which his coat was made. Then
Fields picked up a stone and hurled
it at the horse, which immediately
turned and ran home at the top of its
speed.
The murderer thereupon entered
the thicket and disappeared in it.
When the riderless horse of the
murdered man reached the planta
tion a great commotion took place
among the slaves standing in the
court-yard.
They called out Miss Anna Bella
Money, whom they showed the pant
ing, foaming horse.
Anna was only sixteen, but rather
U tall for her age, and one of the most
beautiful daughters of the sunny
South.
She was vain and hanghty, and the
only redeeming trait in her chara!
ter was the passionate love W&'cU
she felt for her father.

Monty wCeri found half an hour later
Iand taakell to Iihis Ihouse, where Ihis
daugh1ter burst into heart-rending
cr~ies.
Mudldenrily she sprang to her feet,
and lifting up lier hand to heaven, 1
shie exclaiimed, in a vibrating voice:
"1 swear to heaven that, with these
hands of mine, I will tear the flesh
from the body of the miscreant who
murdered my poor father !"
After uttering
'TI11iESE TERRIFIC WORDS
She never shed another tear, but set
about with wonderful calmness to dis
cover her father's assassin.
The Sheriti of the county, and a num
her of other citizens, left no stone un
turnedl to ferret out the perpetrator of
this horible crime; but all their efforts
were utterly fruitless.
In the mean time Bernard Fields had
called upon Anna Bella Money
He had assumed the name of John
Strong. and he told her that he would i
try hard to help her in her efforts to
DISCOVER THE ASSASSIN OF IIER FATHER. I
"If you tind him," she said to him on I1
one of these occasions, "I shall do all i
can to prove my gratitude to you.'
He told her that he was her admirer,
and wanted to marry her. He spoke to
her of his estates in Cuba and Texas.
He promised to buy her diamonds of
which a Princess would be pronud.
Anna was completely dazzled. She
ºmarried him a few dlays later. In Chat
tanooga no one had recognized him.
One day, not long afterwards, he ap.
peared before his wife in a velvet suilt.
She admired it until her eyes fell snd
denly upon the sleeve, from Which a small
piece had been torn out.
Then she recalled the piece of velvet I
that had fallen from the mouth of her
father's horse.
She burst into a scream of horror.
"John," she hissed out, "you are my
father's assassin !"
Her husband turned livid.
She gave the alarm, and an hour later
Fields was in the hands of the Sheriff.
Then some of his old acquaintances
recognized him. They had heard him
swear, on his departure from Chattanoo
ga, that he would kill Richard Money
one day.
The tell-tale piece of velvet was found,
and it led eventually to the conviction of
the prisoner.
He was found guilty of murder in the
3 first degree, and hanged at Chattanooga
on the 19th of June, 1847.

SCONJUGAL AFFECTION.
How the Earl of Nithsdale Es
a caped from the Tower of
a London.
I
SAmong the persons who were con
demned to suffer for their share in at
t tempting to place the Pretender on
the British throne, 1715, was the Earl
s of Nithedale; and there is no doubt
but that lie would have shared the
I fate of the Earl of Derwentwater and
If the others we suffered had not his
a amiable wife effected his escape. This
g circumstance, exhibiting so strong an
e instance of courage and of conjugal
Ii affection, can not be better related
than in the following extract of a let
y ter from the Countess of Nithsdale to
dI her sister, the Countess of Traquair,
- writen in 1716:
"The next morning I could not go
to the Tower, having so many things
in my hands to put in readiness; but
in the evening, when all was ready,
d Isent for Mrs. Mills, with whom I
lodged, and acquainted her with my
- design of attempting My Lord's es.
le cape, as there was no prospect of his
being pardoned; and this was the
Fe last night before the execution. I
;o told her that I had every thing in
readiness, and that I trusted she
a would not refuse to accompany me,
.d that My Lord might refuse to accom
pany me that My Lord might pass for
re her. I pressed her to come imme
diately, as we had no time to lose.
ir At the same time I sent for Mrs Mor
n gan, then usually known by the
;- name of Hilton, to whose acquaint
P, ance my dear Evans had introduced
*0 me, and to whom I immediately com
h municated (my resolution. She was
!e of a very tall and slander make, so I
begged her to put under her own
-. riding-hood one that I had prepared
~- for Mrs. Mills, as she was to lend hers
in to My Lord. Mrs. Mills was then
11 pregnant, so that she was not only
ia of, the same height, but nearly the
to same size as My Lord. When we
3e were in the coach I never ceased
ut talking that the might have no leisure
al to reflect. Their snrprise and aston
ishment when I first opened my de
:h sign to them had made them consent
er without ever thinking of the conse
quences. On our arrival at the Tow
ad er the first I introduced was Mrs.
iS Morgan, for I was only alowed to
take one in at the time. She brought
in the clothes that were to serve Mrs.
Mills when she left her own behind
* her. When Mrs. Morgan had taken off
sd what she had broouht for my por
ly pose, I condnuted er back to the
its staircase, and, in going I begged her
to send me in my maid to dress me;
Bd that I was afraid of being too late to
Spreent my last petition that night if
h- e did not come immediately.,
a- dispatched her safe, and went r'd
ce down stairs to meet Mrs. Y;, han
he had the precaution to hob a
Ia erchief to her faeaj,~ very~ na
I tural for a woman dowhwa
it- goingto bid her .,stfarewell to a
friend on the* ,.rof his execution. I
er had, mnd ., desired her to do it,
that , i ord might go out in the
iy am anner. Her eyebrows were
or inclined to be sandy, and my
be rd were dark and very thick;
however, Ihad prepared some paint of
the color of here to disguise them. I
also brought an artifcial head-dress
i- of the same colored hair as hers, and
painted his face with white and his
1, cheeks with rouge to hide his long
aD beard, whicb he had no time to shave.
'- All this provision I had before left in
the Tower. The poor guards, whom
La my slight liberality the day before
et had endeared me to, let me go qoietly
with my company, sud were not strict
It ly on the watch as they had been;
le sad usually the more so as from what
Sbad told them the dal before they
were persuaded that the Irisoners
woild iobtain their pIrdlon. I made
3t$rs. Mills take of lher ow"i hood and
put on that which I lied brought for
her. I then took her lby the hand
and let liher out of Mly Lord's chain
her; and in passing through the next
room, in which thr ere r several
people, with all the concern imnagin
able said: 'My dear Mrs. Catherine,
go in all haste and send me my wait
ing maid, she certainly can not re
flect how late it is ; she forgets that I
am to present a petition to-night,
and if I let slip this opportunity I am
undone, for to morrow will be too
late. Hasten her as much as possible,
for I shall be on thorns till she comes.'
Every person in the room, chiefly the
guards' wives and daughters, seemed
o compassionate ime exceedingly
and the sentinel policiously opened
the door. When I had seen her out
I returned back to My Lord and fin
ished dressing him. I had taken care
that Mrs. Mills did not go out crying
as she came in, that My Lord might
the better pass for the lady who camne
in crying and afflicted; and the imore
so because hlie had the same dress on
which she wore. When I had almost
finished dressing Miy Lord in all my
petticoats excepting one, I perceived
that it was growing dark, and was
afraid that the light of the candles
might betray us,; so I resolved to set
out. I went out leading him by the
band, and he held his handkerchief
to his eyes. I spoke to him in the
most piteous and afflicting tone of
voice, bewailing bitterly the negli
gence of Evans, who had ruined me
by her delay. Then, said I, 'My dear
Mrs. Betty, for the love of God, run
quickly and bring her with you. You
know my lodging, and if ever you
made dispath in your life do it at pres
ent for I am almost distracted with
this disapointment.' The guards
opened the doors, and I went down
stairs with him, still conjuring him to
make all possible dispatch. As soon
as he had cleared the door I made him
walk before me, for fear the sentinel
should take notice of his gait, but I
still continued to press him to make
all the haste he possibly could. At
the bottom of the stairs I met my
dear Evans, into whose hands I con
fided him. I had before engaged Mrs.
Mills to be in readiness before the
Tower to conduct him to some place
of safety in case we succeeded. He
looked upon the affair as so very im
probable to sudceed that his astonish
ment when he saw us threw him into
such consternation that he was almost
beside himself, which Evane perceiv
ing, with the greatest presence of
mind, without telling him anything,
lest he should mistrust them, con
ducted him to some of her own friends
on whom she could rely; and so se
cured him, without which we should
have been undone. When she had
conducted him, and left him with
them, she returned to find Mr. Mills,
who by this time had recovered him
self from his astonishment. They
went home together, and, having
found a place of security, they con
daucted him to it."
After being concealed a few days
in London, the Earl passed with the
retinue, and, in the livery of a Vene
tian Embassador, to Dover, where,
hiring a small vessel, he escaped to
Calais, and thence traveled to Rome,
where he died in the year 1744.
Remarkable Facts,
N. O. Picayune.
An examination of the cotton state
ment published in the Picayune, of
Sunday morning, reveals some re
markable and extraordinary facts
facts which may well arrest the at
tention of this community and en
list the thoughtful consideration of
all persons who take an interest in
its welfare. The statement is made
to November 30, up to which date it
I appears that the total receipts of cot
ton at all points were 1,749,529 bales.
Up to the same time last year the
receipts were 1,503,427 bales, show
ing an increase of 246,102 bales, or
a fraction more than 16 per cent. If
' New Orleans had participated in this
increase, in due proportion, her re
ceipts would have been 456,632 bales.
In point of fact her receipts were
B 265,493 bales, a falling off of 192,139
I bales, or 42 per cent., from what we
B had a right to expect. Taking the
- actual results as compared with those
of last year, we find that the receipts
of fve principal ports were as fol
- lows:
1878. 18
New Orleans......195,493 81,157
G lveston.........267,292 267,521
Savanh·...........882, 908,572
Charleston.M.......842 134,365
Mobile. . leans loses 128,156
Thus New,,11 loses 25,523 bales;
8 bales, andeaton gains 86,105 bales,
whilst gq gains 115,054 bales, and
avaton gains 79,044 bales, Or,
ut it in another way, of the total
eceipts up to November 30th, New
Orleans received last year 26 per
cent., this year 15 per cent.; Galves
ton received last year 12 per cent.,
this year 15 per cent.; Savannah re
ceived last year 17 per cent., this year
21 per cent.; Chaaleston received last
year 13 per cent., this year 16 per
cent.; Mobile received last year 8
per cent., this year 6 per cent.
If it were to be supposed that this
apparent change ia the currents of
commerce depend on permanent
causes, these fgures would be alarm
iog and discouraging. As it is they
are of a nature to require that we
sbould seek at once for an explana
tion and aremedy. The explanation,
we presume it will be coneded lies
upon the surface of the problem, The
forces which have deflected the course
of trade out of its normal channel
are, for the time being, at least, ex
ceptional. They do not depend on a
change in modes or facilities of trans
Eportation, but on a cause whrcb, for a
time, tendered our modes sad faci.l'
tiesof EtrisportatioR partly 1nopas
tive. This cause is to be found in
the local quarantines against New
Orleans, which were kept up for so
nimany weeks along the lines of rail
road. It is a cause which might be
come permanent, if we are to be'af
flicted with yellow fever from year to
year, but which will cease to exist if
we shall be successful in excluding
the yellow fever from our city. The
trade which we have lost this year
we shall not be able to recover this
year, and every business man knows
that New Orleans cannot retain her
position as a great commercial city if
she does not regain in future the rela
tive position which she has hitherto
held. She cannot afford to be cut off
from intercourse with the interior;
she cannot, in short, afford that her
cotton trade should be diverted to
Galveston and Charleston and Savan
nah. This is the great practical point
in all discussions of the quarantine
question with relation to the effeot of
quarantine, whether exterior, or in
terior, on the commerce of this city.
Madrid Newspapers on Grant.
Constitutional Espanol.
We have oftentimes asked our
selves the question: Why is this
foreigner (Grant) lionized wherever
hlie appears in Europe 9? That he may
have distinguished himself in his own
country and achieved great deeds we
are willing to admit; but what claims
to recognition he can have on this
side of the Atlantic we fail to per
ceive, if we are to judge him accord
ing to his behavior here. He was
preeminently bonored by our august
monarch and his ministers beyond
any precedent in history; and yet he
has been very negligent, not to say
guilty of a gross breach of good breed
ing and etiquette in having failed to
pay his respects and congratulations
to the King immediately after his
lucky escape from the hands of an
assassin, because, forsooth, the rhil
road tickets had been bought for Lis
bon, and the loss of the sum could
not, in his mercenary mind, be for a
moment entertained. Had he been
descended from royal blood, he would
not have hesitated.

and charging himself with messages
of congratulation for the King, evin-o.

It seems that Gen. Grant was guil
ty of excess in the banquet given him

sented a much-to-be lamented sypo

of the minieter's box at the REyal

only thing wanting to stamp him as
unworthy of all the civilities show
ered upon him.

Poor old blind Excelsior is dead.
There may be many who cannot re
