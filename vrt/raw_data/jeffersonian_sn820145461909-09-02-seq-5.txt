T
following article has been
clipped for the benefit of our
readers. It is timely, as with
us in the South the fly claims
“all seasons summer,” and this is
perhaps the time when he is most
exasperating and dangerous:
Food and Flies.
Right among us is an insect guilty
of distributing a score or more of
diseases, all of them more or less
fatal. We have looked upon the fly
as a sort of innocent nuisance, and
have not realized the great harm that
this pest is doing.
The fly’s foot —and you will re
member that the fly has several feet
—ends in a pad covered with innu
merable hairs, and at the end of each
hair is a little hollow sucker for the
purpose of drawing up matter. It
would not be far-fetched to compare
the foot to a toohbrush; and moist
matter has the very best possible
chance to stick to this hair-covered
pad. It has been demonstrated that
a single fly can carry one hundred
thousand living germs in one trip
from the manure heap or the privy
to the kitchen or the dining-table.
The filthiest pig finds it difficult to
compete with the fly in filthiness, and
is infinitely less dangerous as far as
health is concerned, because we do
not admit the pig into our larder;
but, unfortunately, we have been ad
mitting the fly, thinking it a harm
less creature.
Flies thrive in filth; they can not
exist without filth. When a fly seeks
an appropriate place for depositing
its eggs, it looks for some kind of or
ganic filth so that its eggs will after
ward hatch and produce other flies.
Flies breed in refuse heaps of all
kinds, manure heaps, stables, slaugh
ter-houses, butcher shops, pail
closets, privies, bone works, ash pits,
garbage deposits, sewage pools, etc.,
also in restaurant kitchens, private
kitchens which are not kept clean,
milk shops, dairies, and confection
ers’ shops, as well as numerous
other places.
They hasten the spoiling of milk
and of all other foods. They carry
the germs from their breeding places
to the larder, where the food is kept,
and walking over the food, contami
nate it.
Is it strange that flies carry dis
ease? Diarrhoea of infants, typhoid
fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, small
pox, measles, whooping cough,
cholera, anthrax, tuberculosis, dys
entery, glanders, erysipelas, opthal
mia, and other diseases are spread
by flies. In New York city diarrhoea
carries away about seven thousand
infants annually, and there is every
evidence to show that this terrible
scourge is due largely to the agency
of flies.
Extermination is a very difficult
thing, because the fly is most prolific.
Keller estimates that one fly pro
duces in a single summer season two
million flies; and that is a very
modest estimate. We ought to at
tempt not only to destroy them, but
also to prevent, as far as possible,
their development. It is possible
that with our best efforts we can not
absolutely exterminate flies, but we
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
can go a long way toward that, if we
give heed to some very simple meas
ures, which we can put into effect in
our own homes everywhere. Sum
ming it up in a word, the secret is in
keeping the premises clean and sweet
all the time. Just as long as there
is suitable material for the develop
ment and multiplication of flies, just
so long they will multiply by the mil
lions. But they must have organic
filth for their multiplication. A proof
of this is the presence of the fly
wherever there is filth.
The only permissible convenience
in towns ought to be the water
closet. And in country and town the
greatest heed must be paid to refuse
of any kind. Whether from kitchen
or stable, even though it be merely
the sweepings from the floor, the re
fuse must be kept in receptacles,
tightly covered, and must be emptied
frequently, and the receptacles should
then be cleaned out and disinfected.
If we would follow that one sugges
tion, it would go very far toward the
extermination of the fly.
Secondly, stables, barns and out
houses should be built just as far as
possible away from dwelling-houses,
and should be kept clean, for your
own sake as well as for the sake of
your cattle, the milk of which you
use. The manure should be spread
on the land as fast as possible, or kept
in water-tight tanks with closed
covers. The manure heap is a very
prolific developing place for flies.
All offensive matter, garbage, and
kitchen and house refuse ought to be
kept in closed tanks or receptacles,
and taken away from the premises
at frequent intervals, daily if possi
ble. To destroy all breeding places
make free use of disinfectants. «.
To protect our houses we should
use screens, and look upon it as a
disgrace to have a fly in the house.
I do not hesitate to say that a single
fly is able to carry the infection of
disease, and lay some one on a bed
of illness, from which he may never
rise. I would recommend, then,
every possible device by which we
can keep flies out of our houses.
Let us have fly-proof houses. —A.

Still, it does not go quite far
enough. It will riot avail the house
wife much if she keep her own prem
ises ever so clean, and has to buy
her groceries at some dirty little
“store” where flies have from time
immemorial dropped into the molas
ses barrel and therein been embalmed
in sweetness, have nibbled on the su
gar, and literally pawed over every
thing from one season to the next.
With such groceries as must neces
sarily be cooked and washed, the
danger is not so great, although it is
unpleasant to think of eating stuff
exposed to such filth; but there are
many things which are eaten in a
raw state, where thorough cleansing
is not practicable. Why not require
the grocery store and butcher shop
to be immaculately clean? There is
absolutely no reason why they should
not be, except laziness and ignorance
on the part of the proprietor, backed
Uftffftrsonlan
up by the indifference on the part of
the patrons. The “sto” is too often
a place for lounging, tobacco spit
ting, cutting watermelons and strew
ing the rind around where the flies
swarm to get it and of every other
sort of dust and dirt.
Let us be consistent and realize
that there’s no use to be “nasty-nice”
at home, if we stroll to the corner
drug-store and imbibe germ-laden
milk, out of glasses and spoons bare
ly rinsed, not really cleansed, after
someone’s else use. Patronize only
those places which understand and
conscientiously practice sanitation.
People are waking up about these
things, but after all it is strange to
see how much “in spots” it is. In
Atlanta, they compelled us all, on
pain of death or other heavy penalty,
to get garbage cans with lids. Every
body forthwith bought a can—and,

by some strange imbecility, most of
the manufacturers turned out cans
with corrugated sides’ So that it is
a matter of difficulty, and few will
take the trouble, to keep the cans
clean and scalded, and more varieties
of germs will breed in those slimy
little hollows than could be imagined
in a nightmare about “bugs.”
September brings to hundreds of
communities the fear and dread of
fever. It is the time when typhoid
begins to get in its autumn work.
There are families which year after
year see some one or more of their
members stricken down with this
treacherous disease. A careful clean
sing of the premises will do much to
eradicate it altogether. Do not be
lieve those who tell you that typhoid
fever is not infectious. It is not con
tagious in the sense that you dare
not visit your sick friends, or nurse
them with impunity, but it is high
ly infectious, and communicated
through food or drink which has be
come contaminated by germs from
the patient.
One reason why typhoid is so prev
alent in the fall, is that the heavy
rains at that time sweep the surface
filth into streams and wells, and the
water becomes impure while the end
of summer finds people tired and
run down. The water you drink may
look clear, and taste all right, but
