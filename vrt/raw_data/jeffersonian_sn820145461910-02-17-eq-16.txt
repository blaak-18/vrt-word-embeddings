LAYMEN’S MOVEMENT A BUSI
NESS VENTURE.
Dear Sir:—l send you a clipping
from today’s paper. It is about this
unique Laymen’s Missionary Move
ment. The writer states frankly
that it is a “business proposition’’.
Pray, in this commercial country,
whose business is it? Can it be the
business of the Steel Trust, to in
duce missionaries to go forward
with gifts and benefits to China,
Africa and Mexico; to prepare the
way for the establishment of some
big American industry? Are some
of our multi-millionaires intending
to exploit those lands, and do they
want the aid of theastute missionary?
There is no pretense about saving
the worthless Mongolian or African
soul—this is a new venture. Frank
ly, “it is a business proposition.”
The claim is also made, that it is a
religious revival. Clearly it is not —
if it were, the object would be to
clean up New York city. Evidently,
these assembled New Yorkers are
having (to quote again) “visions of
wealth and power,” and need an
army of missionaries to aid in their
projects.

WANTS TO TALK WITH BROUGH
TON AND ELLIS.
Dear Sir:—l just can’t wait any
longer—am obliged to express my
appreciation of the Jeffs.
What you are doing for the be
nighted is “sweeter than honey and
honeycomb” to the old Pops. Now’,
if those ignoramuses are still boiling
over for a debate, I hereby challenge
any two of them for a joint tussle.
Will give Mr. Ellis one hour to
open and Dr. Broughton an hour to
close. Will only want thirty minutes
between them, but the way I will
auctioneer coons (Dear Little Dora)
for sale will, as the boys say, “take
the bone out.” Talk about sophis
tries and slipperiness, didn’t they
slip when they cited you to their own
literature that condemned them, and
did not know’ it. And Ellis reads
books seven years before they are
published. These jugglers ought to
get together on their tricks. “Great
is Diana of the Ephesians’” Their
“craft’’ is now gone. Have known a
long time that the missionary busi
ness was largely a fake. Had no
confidence in it, and paid nothing to
it in many a long day. Say, is not
Dr. Broughton the Baptist who ad
vocated the sprinkling of babies, or
of taking them into the church, sev
eral years ago?
If so, did or would coon babies be
included?
Don’t let these missionary “craft”
fellow’s back from my challenge, or,
rather, from my acceptance of theirs.
They may try to work the unknown
racket on me, but they can’t do it.
Yours for more fun,
C. H. JOHNSON.

A SCOTCHMAN’S APPRECIA
TION.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —Some
months ago father-in-law made me a
present of your Magazine for a year,
and it has proved to be an exceed
ingly acceptable gift. I have much
enjoyed it, and it is a certainty that
it shall continue to make its visits
to my home.
Ybur articles upon Socialism are
timely and strong, and to my mind
are exactly what are needed at this
time; there is no doubt in my mind
but that Socialism is a dangerous
menace both to Church and State.
Without being well informed I have
held exactly the view which you are
giving us with such great clearness
that even a child may understand.
You are doing a great, and a needed
work as well, and I sincerely hope
that when you are done with this
subject, that these exceptionable ar
ticles will be given permanancy in
book form, and I much desire to
have the first copy of the book, and
will be glad to remit the price upon
notification.
But what most moved me to write
you, was your magnificent defense
of the Scotch people. I think that I
keep fairly well in touch with con
temporaneous literature, and to my
mind this article is the peer of any
thing I have read in years. For sus
tained eloquence, for the skillful
handling of undeniable historical
facts, as a lofty tribute to the good
and true worth of the noble men of
another day, it will stand for long
in my memory as unique and as un
rivalled. As one who has Scotch
blood in his veins, and who has been
proud of it, I am your debtor, and
am sincerely grteful, for this mag
nificent tribute. Indeed I am glad
that Mr. Carnegie spoke those un
deniably lying words, otherwise this
gem of yours w’ould not have glad
dened my heart, and this great con
tribution to truth would not have
been uttered, for I do not think it
likely that any other, save a man
who tried so hard to defraud his
government, and imperil the lives of
sailors, and render impossible the
success of his own country in time
of war, would have had the temerity
to utter this foul scandal upon the
best blood of the world. So let it
be known, good has already come
out of evil, and if there be in his
golden armor a joint a million times
as large as the blow-holes in the
armor furnished the battleships, it is
a certainty that your keen lance will
have reached his vitals, and if he
shall have survived at all, it is sure
that the Negro, his past and present
and, likely, his future, will be a
closed subject with the “Laird of
Skibo.”
I enclose also my check; please
move my subscription up a year. I
must not be denied the small per
sonal satisfaction of helping such
work as this, even by a trifle.
With sincere thanks, I am,
Very respectfully yours,
F. A . BROWN.

A PLEA FOR AN AFFLICTED ONE.
Dear Sir: —Inclosed find a letter,
from a poor afflicted human being,
which will explain itself. I, too, like
you, don’t believe in Foreign Mis
sions, as now operated. The reason
people in our own country, in the
shadow of our churches, are left
helpless and in the greatest destitu
tion, is because fanatics are carried
away with something way beyond
us. We now see those at our feet
who would be glad of the crumbs
that fall from our table. This poor
boy doesn’t ask for luxuries in food,
he only asks that he may have
enough to sustain life. His misfor
tune to be so terribly afflicted is
enough: it is not right that he
should have to simply beg people
for a .bare living. Where are our
missionary-spirited church mem
bers? Where are the many socie
ties that say they have a charity
fund? Where does that fund go to,
into which its members are paying
something every month? Is it sent
to other countries? Right now, thou
sands of dollars are being sent to
the relief of Paris, and not one
sent to this poor, bed-ridden hu
man being right in our midst.
You seem to always sympathize
with those who are distressed; may
be there is something you can cause
to be done for this poor boy.
With best wishes, I am
Very truly yours,
SUBSCRIBER.

THIS VET IS A HUSTLER.
Dear Sir: —Thanks for the knife;
it is a daisy. I took the weekly Jeff
of September 30th to the County
Union and showed it to one of the
Galveston delegaes. He said that
the slick Duck stated that England
and Germany passed this ship sub
sidy and they wanted the United
States to do the same to put our
marine on a par with them.
I denied the statement that they
were paid by those governments any-
<31)4. Jeffersonian
thing to run their ships. I contend
ed if the tariff was removed our
merchants could compete with other
countries.
We had collected a crowd, which
said that the tariff was worn out
one hundred years ago. I told them
Livingston, Bailey, Bryan and Can
non, Aldrich and Taft were working
it for the trusts and manufacturers,
as Gorman and Cleveland did. I
asked him to look at the cost of liv
ing now and in the past. He said
it was because of our extravagance,
and we lived better. He said he
would believe anything you stated as
a fact, but he could theorize as easy
as you or I.
Common sense teaches me that
there is no government but the Uni
ted States that taxes one industry
for another. If you will answer him
send me some extra copies and I will
place them where they will do good.
Yours truly,

A PREACHER WHO WAS PEEVISH
Dear Sir: —Enclosed, P. O. money
order, for which send Watson’s Jef
fersonian Magazine one year to en
closed address.
I can not refrain from expressing
how much I appreciate your articles
on Foreign Missions and racial puri
ty. They are subjects on which
my neighbors can not. say, “O, you
got that from Tom Watson.” I for
many years have known that we
needed mission teachers and lec
turers more than foreign countries.

And long ago ceased to contribute
to the cause.
The apathy of the people is de
plorable, religiously, morally and po
litically; selfishness is the ruling
motive. But the Bible tells us such
will be the condition of the world in
the time of the end, not the end of
the world, but the “end of the Gen
tiles.”
I was pained to see Tom Dolan
class Zion’s Watch Tower readers
with the deluded people who looked
for the destruction of the world.
When the true facts are, the “Plan
of the Age’s Millennial Dawn” teach
es that this earth will never
be destroyed; only kingdoms of men,
as now existing, will be done away
with. And it is poor policy to ex
press oneself about any subject
