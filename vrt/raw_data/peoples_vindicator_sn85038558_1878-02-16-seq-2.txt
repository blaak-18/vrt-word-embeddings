SATURDAY, - - IEtR. 16, I878.
Who has the Helhil
No sane man in Louisiana can de
ny the feet, that the present outlook
is exceedingly alarming. At no hour,
in our opinion, during the past ten
years have we been, as a people, in
such a preearions situation. Hereto
fore, and during that time tile battle
was fought against the monster Radi
calism itself-now, the effort is to
destroy the evils which it Inculcated,
and which, if not rooted out, will des
troy us.
We ask in all candor, with a sensi
bility of the danger which surround,,
us, and frmw which we must speedi
ly be delivered--with the roar of the
breakers of distruction in front, to
the right and left, and below us;
with snarling demagogues and idiots
in the Chart Room-wno HAS THE
HELMI
Is the gallant old Democratic party
of Louisiann--freighted with every
interest our liberty, property and
civilization hold dear-scarred with
its thousand wounds in the people's
battles; is that party to go to the
wall because no man can be found
with courage and genius enough;
with virtue above selfishness; with
statesmanship comprehensive be
yond the miserable quibbles of Black
stone and Kent, to take the wheel and
pilot her out of the danger which
threatens, and tl e disaster which
seems immanent for her distruction.
It seems so. We look in vain for
Nicholls in this hour of our crisis.
He is wrapt in the sombre mantle of
his dream. No word of encourage
ment has passed his lips since we, as
a people have honored him with the
post of PILOT. We looked in vain
in his Message for one word that
would cheer the patriot's heart. It
was one dreary sea of platitudes;
reciting all'the ills, that the merest
tyro knows is sapping our political
and social system as surely as death,
unrelieved by a single manly sugges
tion of relief. What does this mean
Has this man no heart for the peo
ple, or is the peril too great, or the
position beyond his mental force ?
We speak feelingly and impera
tively, because the situation demands
it. It is the duty of a Governor, to
nog only carry out the will of the
people of his State, but it is also his
duty to hearken to their wants and
demands, and to carry their sugges
tions to those who have the power,
if properly applied, to give them
relief.
The people have found no response
from their present Executive. No
word of encouragement has been
vouchsafed them in this, the hour of
their agony. It is time lie should do
something! He must do it, else his
motives for silence and inaction must
be explained. If hle feels unequal to
the present emergency, he owes it as
a duty to the people to say so, and
not remain as hlie has, supinely silent
-without effort or suenggestion-and
allow them to drift back into the
awful jaws of Radical-negro rule.
There are, thank Gfod, a few men in
Louisiana, who have not only tie
ability, but the will to save the Dem
eocratic party and thereby protect the
people, their interest, and civiliza
tion from the raul and degredation
wheli now threatens them.
We ask again; who is at the helm?
The coauntry people are listening to
Iear some acute chronic "Conserva
tive" of New Orleaas, bellow out
that "Wiltz is the nian to blame for
all thisl" It's the case, that every
time the idiots tvo this State to earlth,
-te pt all tim blame on some onueg
man who has all along been snubbed
and has had. nothing to do wfth the
manner of conducting affairs which
esnulted in disaster.
The legirslature, under the t'amend
ment plan" ean, by a two-third vote,
reman in- session for two years;
tiihey can estabflsli tliirty Judicial
Districts in the State, and pay the
Judges twenty thousand dollars, or
more, a year each. It's folly to say a
gislatnre will not do what is grant
ed them the power to do, to the ful.
est extent.
The Jury in the Andersen trial re

mercy of the Ceart.' Judge Whlita

UNWRITTEN HISTORY.
The Judgment creditors ate triti
cising very severely the action of
the Police Jury in tIfusing to meilto
rialize the Legislature for authority
to fund outstanding obligations; to
issue bonds therefor, and levy a tax
to provide for their payment.
We desire to premise our remarks
on this sulbject by stating, that the
Police Jury, the good people of this
parish, and ourself a tax payer,
are willing that all the honest debts
r, due by the parish should be liquida
ted in a fair and equitable manner.
n But, we affirm with equal distinct
ness, that they, and we, with our
e humble efforts, propose to resist the
payment of a simgle dollar of the
large amount of these claims, knotrw
to be fotnlded on fraon, to the
last extremity. The P'EOPL.'S VIN
SICATOft assumed that position at the
I"
beginning, and will steadfastly main
tain it to the end.
The discussion of this whole ques
tion, we think, Is eminently proper,
and is in fact required, to the end
that the public, and those particular
E ly who pay taxes, sehtnld thoroughly
understand the whole history of these
Sinjudgments, and particularly should
c they know what efforts have been
made to settle them, and the result
ir of those efforts.
'8 A tax REFORM ASSOCIATION, with
e M. BoYCE Esq., as President, was
d organized in this parish in the year
1871, for the put pose of checking the
h issuance of warants, at the behest
and to supply the wants of the ring
o. f plunderers at that time and al'er
wards infesting this parish. This
I REFORM ASSOCIATION appointed a
l Committee of two of their members,
Messrs. Carver and Caspari, to ap
,r peal fromn the findings of the judg
. ments in the District and Parish
f Courts of this parish to the Supreme
Court. Well knowing their fate
s when that tribunal was reached, the
e judgment creditors entered into the
n following solemn agreement:
it NATCIIITOCIIES, LA.,
[t February, 19, 1872.
* We, the undersigned Judgment
it holders against the parish of Natchi
lI toches, hereby obligate and bind our
selves to Marshall H. Carver and
' Leopold Caspari, in consideration of
- the said Carver and Caspari with
I drawing their appeal from the Dis
t. trict Court of the parish of Natchito
ches to the Supreme Court, to sub
'e mit our Judgments and the warrants
and other indebtedness, on which the
i. Judgments were founded, to the ar
Iitmation of three disinterested per
sons, with power to re:ject all war
0 rants or evidences founded on illegal
e or unjust considerations. The amount
s of said rejected paper to be credited
d on the Judgments, the paper them
selves to be returned to the ownters
on their giving a receipt for the same,
r, specifying their raumbers, time when
n issued, and amoulte, who agree to
seek relief against their endorsers or
transferers only, and not to hold the
Sparish liable for the same. That af
o ter the rejection of said papers as
n above mentioned shall have been
, made, there shall be no objection
made by said Carver and Caspari to
Ic the collection of the amounts founnd
is due, justly and legally by the parish,
Jt to the parties signing this agreement.
Thie said amounts found by said ar
bitors to be just and due, to be paid
1b: the parish in two annual pay
d ments. It is agreed that thle said ar
t bitraters are to mbe selected and ap
Spointed as follows: One by the un
dersigned Judgment holders, one by
e said Carver and Caspari, or by the
8. Committee of Reform, and one by the
n two so appointed. None of the ar
biraters but Attorneys, may appear
' beTore the arbitratr.e: In case said
'- arbitrators shall find any paper on
e which judgment has been rendered
. more than once, such ptper, if legal
and just, shall be credited on alljudg
mentls based on it, except the first
one so rendered, and if illegal or un
I just the amount of said paper shall
be credited on all judgments based
on same. February 19th, 1872.

SThis wAnk a sqoamn: '.emeuve,,
wherein efltrt was made on the part
of the people to fairly settle with the
judgment creditosa, and how did they
beep faith ?
They violated it-and gave for rea
sons (!) therefor, quibbles which might
hold good in some Courts, but which
public Tpinidn, to which they now
appeal, will unhesitatingly condemn.
They stated, first; that the gentlemen
named as arbitrators had not beein
sworn; and secondly, that the Attor
ney's signing had no authiority to do
so from their clients. Did they stop
there, and in a spirit which fairness
to say the least of it would demand
and remedy their objections$ Did
they deny the justness of the findings
of this Board of Arbitration? They
did not--but thel wrent on drawing
dirider.ds, colleete4 from the people by
taration on these same claims, knowing
them to be frauds, because they htad
been so pronoutnced by a hoard oflgen
tlcmen whose word, any day was as
good as their oaths.
On this $10838.70 of claims, reek
ing with fraud, the parties owning
them di ew from the taxpayer $6,932,
24, or over 60 per cent, after the
Board had pronounced them worth
less.
Comment, we conceive to be total
ly unnecessary. There is the agree.
ment between the judgment creditors
and the people; the findings of the
Board of Arbitration, matters of pub
lic record, and the Clerk's office con
tains the suits founded on fraudulenot
paper, upon which these same own
ers of judgments drew dividends.
It is the duty of those who hold
honest claims to assist the parochial
authotities in recovering this amount
from those who, unjustly and in vio
lation of a sacred agreement, retain
it. Instead of denouncing th' Police
Jury let them come to their help,
and endeavor to recover this $6,932.
24, so that they can apply it to the
payment of those claims which are
just and then provide for the settle
ment of the remainder afterwards.
We cite plain figures, and deal in
nothing but stubborn facts-the pub
lic can form their own estimate of
the offence. We will continue this
expose of the Judgment business un.
til all is known.
Constitutional Amendments.
We cannot, as some of our contem
poraries, see even one remnove in the
proposed amendmhents above the in
strument they propose to remedy.
Instead of restricting powers as is
demanded, these amendments enlarge
them. Instead of abrogating perni
cious clauses, these amendments do
not touch them. Instead of destroy
ing monopolies, these amendments
permnanently fasten those which ex
ist; and they are in fact, silent as a
charnel house, on every point vital to
the citizen and Ihis interest.
Public opinion here is even more
hostile to the Amendments than to
the Radical Constitution, and tihe
DJmnocratic vote in thIe coming elec
tion, should these amendments be
submitted which we hope and trust
they may not, will be almost solid
against them.
A new Constitution is all that will
satisfy public opinion, and the amend'
ment scheme, tihe offspring of corrup
tion and cowardice, is damned by
the whole body of Louisiana's citizens
at its birth.
Col. Wise, of Caddo, we see, signs
the majority report for tihe amend
ments. The Colonel, we hope, is not
an arenic Artist-that is a flip.flop.
perin statesmanship, but the wires
last week made tire Shreveport Times
say, he would sign thie minority re
port, and favor a Covention in a
speech. It's a minor mistake of ms
jor importance, however.
That thie Legislative department of
thie State govertiment needs to be con
fined to nanmedluties tire ''railroad
ing" through tihe Senateof the Anmend
ments, without one word of debate, am
ply testifies. This august body of so
Ions pushed through those measures,
vital alike to thIe interest of the citi
zen and his property, with such haste
as to east asuspicion over tihe whole af
fair. The rules of the Senate were
observed, while common decency was
violated in every instance. And this
is a Senate which takes. particnlar
pains to affirm that it is not composed
of politicians. We should thimk not;
for of all the acts of politicians, in the
common and vulgar acceptation of
the term, none will compare to the
trickery, indecency and outrage of
this action of the Senate, in dragging
amendments, tmhe people will utterly
repudiate at the polls, through without
