beautiful customs ever designed to
sweeten the heart of humanity. It
has consecrated one day in each year
in that month which is of all the love
liest, —May tenth —as a date for the
specific honoring of
MOTHERS.
Just Mothers! Not alone those il
lustrious dames whose fame twinkles
down through histoiy in the reflected
splendor of great sons; not alone
those conspicuous martyrs who have
laid upon the altar of mankind’s des
perate need the lives which they
brought into being through infinite
pain, and nurtured through years of
self-abnegation; not alone the strong
mothers, the wise mothers, the glo
rious mothers—but, inclusive of ALL
mothers and in veneration for ALL
mothers, will the men who think on
the significance of the day wear the
carnation of snow and spice, verily a
fit floral emblem of pure, fragrantly
wholesome, winsomely human and
completely fulfilled womanhood.
Days there are, upon which it were
impossible that the world did not be
come better through dedication to
ideals, for thoughts indeed are things.
Thus Christmas does not speak in vain
its annual message of peace on earth,
good will to man; nor does Memorial
Day fail to whisper that nobler lives
for the living are a far tenderer trib
ute to the heroic dead than tears alone
could be; while Easter lifts the soul
above the sordid things. So, there
will be something more real and vital,
more permanently uplifting, in the
celebration of Mothers’ Day than the
expression of a formal sentiment.
The universe does not understand
nor recognize bad mothers.. If a wo
man be unfit for this holiest office, she
becomes, so far as the general con
sciousness is concerned, de-humanized,
and yet not of the lower animals, for
they cherish their young with patient,
devotion. She therefore contributes
nothing to the law of averages, be
cause simply not considered. All the
mothers we know, or imagine, are not
only good mothers, but, by some mys
terious rule of beneficence it was giv
en to each one of us to possess the
best of all mothers, whose character
seemed to make it possible that per
fection might even be transcended.
Did she chance to be a sheltered,
fine lady? Did she wear exquisite soft
garments and move amid the quiet re
finements of wealth? Were her fin
gers like satin, whereon glistened the
sparkling things that caught your first
baby-attention ? She was perfect, and
the memory, of her beauty yet dims
the radiance of every belle before or
since. •

or mend a ball, or paste a kite, or
kiss the perpetual bumps and bruises
and “make them well” when either
heart or head were injured, she was
perfect. No matter where your lines
have fallen since, you would give
much of worldly success just to be
back in the little house with her, sing
ing softly at her work.
Or, if she steamed day after day

how plain she looked, how queerly she
dressed or how full her speech might
be of brogue or grammatical errors.
For the differing flesh of women is
as nothing, when the soul has been
kindled with the luminous flame of
mother-love. The palace understands
the cottage, the marvel of motherhood
makes queen and peasant woman akin
in suehwise as men may never achieve
kinship with other men. Station and
condition may vary, but, as mothers,
all women may be without flaw, equal
ly beautiful in the eyes of their chil
dren, and equally wise with the same
spiritual insight.

It has well been said that Love and
Death meet and brood over the wo
man who goes down into the Valley
of the Shadow for Love’s sake, and
in her newborn child renews the
breath of God as it was first breathed
upon man in the Eden of Innocence.
Who would not prostrate himself in
the presence of this miracle?
And so, Mothers’ Day should be
no perfunctory tribute to sentiment,
but a revivification df that spirit of
reverence which honors itself in ob
serving the day. Nor should it suffice
tha t there be a brief pause in the rush
of business, the wearing of a sym
bolic blossom for a few short hours.
It should make each individual
blessed with a living mother show her
the filial affection for which she too
often yearns in vain. Perhaps she
waits lonesomely in the old home,,
whence the boys and 2‘irls have gone,,
and are all too engrossed in their own
affairs to visit her, or write her the
intimate, detailed letters she will read
and re-read until the next news comes.
If the negligent sons and daughters
only knew how short a time she might
be left to await their tardy remem
brance !
It should make each who has lost a
mother, perhaps too early to prove
to her any of the devotion she de
served, resolve to live so as to do her
memory honor, to be such a man or
woman as she would have wished.
It should make all men gentler,
more considerate, more anxious to re

“THE VIOLET.”
By Nellie Burt.
(Written for the Vine and Fig Tree
Department.)
N a quiet little village by
the sea, there resided a
youth who was looked
upon by his neighbors as
being “stuck on him
self.”
One of his neighbors
once said to his comrade,
“Young Flemmings would
; *
* zr* *
not try to save an English lord, if he
were drowning, for fear he would get
his clothes soiled.”
“You are right, pal,” said the one
spoken to. “I would like to buy
Charles Flemmings for what he is
worth, .and sell him for what he
thinks he is worth. I’ll wager you
my hat I’d be so well fixed financially
that I would not have to do the work
ing stunt again as long as I lived.”
But “appearances often deceive,”
and such was the case with Flem
mings, for there came a time when he
ruined one of the handsomest suits
ever worn by any “sport,” and came
very near losing his life for one who
was neither a lord nor a lady, but one
of America’s fairest daughters.
The village maidens looked upon
young Flemmings with favor, which
may have encouraged the dislike of
the village young men toward him.
But this self-respected atheletic young
man seemed blind to their smiles and
graces.
His eyes and heart were opened at
last “in the twinkling of an eye” to
the charms of the new school mistress,
as she stepped into the village post
office and inquired if there was any
mail for Violet Brinson.
“ Well, I’ll be hanged if I ever saw
a daintier little creature,” he sighed
to himself, as lie handed her violet
scented missive post marked New
York. “The violet is her favorite
flower, and her friends have found it
out,” he thought.
Taking the letter in her tiny, jeweled
hands, she quietly and gracefully made
her exit.
Flemming had heard that the ham
let school had been opened, and that
the young lady assistant was from
New York, but beyond that he had
heard naught and cared less, until the
present moment.
The next day he inquired of one of
the young lady’s pupils as to the
hour that the school opened in the
mornings and closed in the after
noons, and he made it a rule after that
fatal day to be on the lookout for
Violet.
If he missed seeing her, he found
a heaviness about his heart that he
could not account for.
Once, when he had lost sight of her
day after day for a week, he asked
of her landlord if the assistant teacher
was at his home. He felt his heart
almost breaking, as the gentleman
made reply, “She is with us and very
critically ill. If she does not improve
soon, she says she will give up her
work and return home as soon as she
