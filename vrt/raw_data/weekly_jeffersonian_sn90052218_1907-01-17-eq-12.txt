We Must Qet Together.
Somehow, somewhere all those who
believe that existing 1 conditions are
wrong, and that there must be a
change for the better, will sink their
differences upon personal and minor
matters, and come to some common
ground of essential principle upon
which all can stand.
Can Mr. Walsh, with his Indepen
dence League, find this common
ground ?
Possibly.
Could Mr. Forrest, with his Jeffer
sonian Clubs, do it?
Perhaps.
Would a conference of such men as
Bryan, Hearst, Folk, La Follette,
Tillman and Watson accomplish it?
Hardly.
The movement which will succeed
in uniting all the radicals must come
from below, not from above.
Tn some way the masses must be
roused, organized and harmonized.
So far back as November 29, 1904,
Hon. C. H. Ellington, of McDuffie
county, Ga. wrote for publication in
one of the Atlanta papers an article
which itself suggests a plan. This
manuscript was never forwarded to
Atlanta, but when its author showed
it to me recently, the idea occurred
to me of submitting it to our readers
and of inviting brief letters from
them, giving their opinions of the
plan of union suggested.
Let Jeffersonians Unite.
Mr. Editor:
I was very much in hopes that Mr.
Watson, Mr. Bryan and Mr. Hearst,
the three greatest living exponents
of Jeffersonian Democracy in this
country, would be able to join forces
in one mighty effort to overthrow
the classes and wrest the government
out of their hands and reorganize a
people’s government. But it seems
that they cannot do so, that as able
as they are the task is too great for
them. What a pity! How strange
three great master minds, whose po
litical creed is practically the same,
believe in the same things, hate the
same things, want the same things,
and not least in their fitness for lead
ership, the great American people be
lieve in them; believe in their abil
ity, their honesty, their sincerity, and
yet they will not harmonize. What
a mighty trio of giants! What an
invincible army—people’s army—
they could organize if they only
would.
Their differences are mere matters
of method, of detail of how to do
what they all agree should he done.
And in the name of the business in
terests and the toiling millions of
this country, in the name of human
ity I appeal to them to reconcile their
differences and unite their forces in
a war of the masses against the class
es.
But if they will not arise to the re
sponsibilities of the hour, then let the
people act and T make this suggestion
that the Jeffersonian Democrats of
the United States, regardless of past
party affiliations, name a day in the
summer of 1905 in every congression
al district in the United States by
counties, when a great white non-par
tisan Jeffersonian primary will be
held for the election of one loyal and
able Jeffersonian Democrat in each
congressional district and two from
each state. Said elected representa
tive Jeffersonian Democrats to meet
in national convention in some central
place for the purpose of uniting in
one grand fighting army this great
force, which is now divided, this con
vention to determine the best meth
od of reinstating a people’s govern
ment by the people and for the peo
ple. If this convention in its wis
dom think best to raise the Jefferson
ian flag over a reorganized Democrat
ic party, well and good; if the con
vention think best to organize a new
party, well and good. Let every Jef
fersonian soldier follow the flag in
loyal devotion to the principles of
government he believes in.
Let Watson and Bryan and Hearst
go to that convention and there advo
cate their views as to the best meth
ods, and then let the convention de
cide which is best by a majority vote.
Now, Mr. Editor, we all know that
we can never win so long as we are
divided and I offer this as one way
in which we can get together, if we
are true followers of the immortal
Jefferson.
I hope you will publish this letter
ard comment on it editorially.
Yours in the fight for a government
of the people.
C. H. Ellington.

A DAY OF RECKONING.
Broxton. Ga., Jan. 1, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: You’ll find enclosed the
price for two of your magazines, and
the price for one of your Weekly
Jeffersonians.
T long to see your two periodicals
cover the Union like the dew that
falls from the blue canopy of heaven.
Every man that toils, every man that
labors, every man that believes in
justice—let him be king or peasant
—should follow your banner of jus
tice.
I am glad to see you spring away
from the jackal and the lion and
may your work continue as long as
men believe in justice. But Town
Topics, may its big-bellied editor,
and his dean co-worker of a bonny
honkadory soon fall like li Lucifer,
never to rise again.”
If T know myself, there is one
sweet and noble day T long to see—
that day is the day when young men
will devote themselves to the study
of justice, the rights of men, the
rights of labor, and capital, and pur
ity of government. If they do, noble
Sire, this nation shall live. If they
refuse, it must fall. May God spare
yon, and protect you and yours, until
vour doctrine shall be universal.
Your friend,
Henry Clay Ellis.

Hon. Thos E. Watson, Editor Wat
son’s Jeffersonian Magazine, At
lanta, Ga.
My dear “Tom”:
Please excuse the familiarity, but
you seem so dear to me since the
regular receipt weekly of your Jeffer
sonian, for it rejoices me so much to
know that one so much abler than
myself is doing that which I have
vainly tried to do on a small scale—
THE WEEKLY JEFFERSONIAN.
show up the evil of the bond bood
lers National Bank graft—the most
diabolical, devilish design the devil
ever devised to destroy the liberty
of a people. No wonder that the
Mann “mogul” and the “De
France” “di-dapper duck,” made
you “walk the plank,” for you had
just begun, in the New York
son,” to make old “Rothy” sea
sick, and they couldn’t stand it—
and so sought to strangle your “still
small voice crying in the wilderness,”
but they simply gave you more pow
er—and “God knows” it is need
ed.
And now comes the REAL “Wat
son’s” Magazine—a regular “trip
hammer,” to the “sledgehammer” of
the Jeffersonian, and it is with the
greatest pleasure of anything ever
done by me in my life-:—next to
“popping the question” to my wife
—to send you almost the last dollar
and a half I have on hand to pay
one year in advance for the real,
ONLY and Simon pure Watson Mag
zine.
Truly trials bring out the “stuff”
that is in a “feller,” as polishing
makes tfiie diamonds brighter, and
your “diamonds” are more brilliant
than ever it seems to me—beyond
all “carats” to register their value!
In the days of the people’s party you
loomed up a great figure, to me, in
the cause of the people, but now
you are a Colossus^—Hearst is a
“has been”—as you say Ihmsen was
his undoing—that was a great vivi
section of Hearst, and he goes into
eclipse, with me!
To me, Sir, you are the hope of this
nation. You hold the flag, and seem
able to do so—and being the natural
leader all should recognize you as
such, and “get busy” at for
the great battle of 1908, with your
self as the standard bearer, that is,
if the Trusts will permfit another
election—which is in doubt, with me
—the way they are planning to down
union labor; the natural, and (by
their convention work) one political
ally of the people’s party, which un
ited can win, and for fear of this
union, the destruction of labor union
ism is planned, and to Col. Mann,
through “clear case” bribery of its
National Secretary (De France)
plutocracy planned paralyzing peo
ple’s party. The latter trick has
failed, thanks to “Tom” Watson,
the “Coeur de Leon” and “Peter”
combined of the greatest crusade in
the world’s history—crusade against
the money trust,, mother "of ALL
trusts.
But the struggle against union
ism goes on. The Supreme Court of
United States has a*»ain in the in
terest of the money power reversed
itself in the case of the Colorado
miners—and they are to be hanged
—and a trumped up pretext of war
with Japan is to be used to mass sol
diers in the West to prevent an “up
rising” of “outlaws” similar to
those being massacred in the Phil
ippines occasionally, to make “shoul
der straps for murderers. Bah! it
is sickening, Mr. Roosevelt!
As before written in this letter,
Hearst is a “has been,” with the
people. He “shied his castor,” set
his lance and lost—and as you so
clearly show, should have—his tak
ing on the tactics suggested by Ihm
sen shows a “streak” in him it is
well the people found out before he
