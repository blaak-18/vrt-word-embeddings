Summary of Ebents as They Happen
By Tom Dolan
On the 10th the Payne Tariff bill
passed the House of Representatives
after stormy debates
which had raged since
the bill was first read.
Payne
Tariff Bill.
The fight on Standard
Oil and the odious deception embodied
in the contravailing proviso was suc
cessful to a certain degree. Speaker
Cannon exhausted himself in defense
of the Standard Oil without avail.
Crude petroleum was placed on the
free list. Other important amend
ments that have recently been made are
those eliminating the provision for a
duty on tea and the contravailing
duty on coffee. The duties on barley,
malt charcoal, iron, pineapples in
crates, saccharine, medicated cotton,
and cotton collars and cuffs as original
ly in the bill, w r ere inreased. To retali
ate against Turkey, which country
prohibits the importation of American
filler tobacco, a proviso was included
in the tobacco schedule increasing the
duty on filler tobacco from any coun
try which prohibits the importation of
the American tobacco.
The internal revenue law was also
amended so that raisers of tobacco
will not have to pay a manufacturers’
license in order to dispose of leaf
tobacco.
There were several technical
changes in the steel schedule, princi
pally downward, and lace curtains
and netting machines were included in
the proviso which permits the entry
free of duty of lace machinery prior
to May 1, 1910. Hides, hosiery and
gloves were left as reported by the
committee, hides remaining free and
increased duty being presented for
gloves and stockings.
Although a hard fight was made for
free lumber it was voted down. Fifty
five Republicans voted for free lumber
and thirty-eight Democrats against it.
The latter, by State, are listed in an
editorial of this issue.

his wife the attitude of the powers is
peculiarly brave, humane and just. A

The State Department of Agricul
ture has issued an order prohibiting
the sale of unbleached
flour in Georgia after the
first of next October.

colored bread of ancient day. The
order is on line with the decision of
the National Department of Agricul
ture which has the approval of Doctor
Wiley as well as of Secretary Wilson.
It is said that 75 to 80 per cent, of
the flour now sold in Georgia is
bleached by the nitrogen-peroxide pro
cess, because it results in making a
whiter flour and enables the mill to
use a larger portion of the wheat than
is the case where flour is not bleached.
It will readily be seen, therefore, what
an extensive effect this order will have
on the flour trade in this State. Most
of the flour mills in Georgia employ
the nitrogen - peroxide process in
bleaching. They will have to discon
tinue this and stop the use of expen
sive plants.

berland Presbyterian Church to unite
themselves and, incidentally, the rest
of the members, and taking with them
the church property, with the Presby
terian Church in the United States of
America. The object of the union
was to facilitate church work and
create a stronger church organization,
and a similar case to the one in Ten
nessee was won in favor of the validi
ty of such union in Georgia. The
opinion of the Tennessee court amply
sustains the original Cumberland
church in their refusal to be merged
into the larger organization, and gives
to them the church property. Which

dred thousand school
teachers of the United
States and Canada will
organize a league for the upbuilding
of their calling. It is to be known
as the North American Teacher’s
League. The purposes of the organiza
tion are stated to be: “Higher sal
aries, pensions for teachers, tenure of

jects that will be dis
cussed are Pellagra, the

office, national and state aid to edu
cation, reciprocity in state certificates,
clearer definition and extension of
teachers’ legal rights, academic free
dom, encouragement of the highest
professional skill on the part of the
teachers, more attention to school
hygiene, playgrounds, gymnasiums
and baths, for each school.”
The movement seems commendable.
Far better would it be for the teach
ers themselves actively to press for
ward for better work and better pay
than meekly to allow the initiative on
the part of some one else in reference
to pensions and other plans to restore
to them some economic equality with
the rest of the professions. It is trite
to say that our school teachers are
grossly underpaid, hardly worked and
that the demand made upon their time
and talent is out of all proportion.
In an interview given to the Asso
ciated Press last week, Daniel J. Sully
outlines a plan that will
be of great interest to
the cotton grower. In
part he said as follows:
The
Sully Plan.
‘ 4 When the farmers of the South
and the business men of the South
say the word, funds will be immedi
ately available in sufficient volume
to forever place the great industry
of cotton production upon a stable
foundation, free from the chance fluc
tuations of the market, relieved from
the attacks of manipulators and leav
ing the gigantic crop monopoly of
this section to respond unem-barrassed
and unrestricted to the legitimate
laws of supply and demand. The
result should mean to the South an
annual cash saving from $150,000,000
to $250,000,000.”
Continuing, Mr. Sully said his plan
contemplates, “the creation of an im
pregnable business system which shall
do away With the annual necessity of
the farmers sacrificing millions of
bales of cotton for pressing debt, con
gesting the market, hammering down
prices, upsetting the reign of supply
and demand and losing to this section
the tremendous sums that are its due
in return for the one crop indispensa
ble to the needs of civilization.
“I do not ask for one penny from
the Southern people, I do not ask the
pleading of one bale of cotton until
I have given ample good faith of suf
ficient financial banking, from sources
that are unquestionable, to carry
every detail of the plan Into effect,
and to safeguard the interest of every
former in the South, from the man
who raises one bale to the man who
raises a thousand bales.
“A minimum fund of $10,000,000,
subscribed by the most conservative
financiers of the United States is
available to be invested in such iron
clad securities as insure the ability
and responsibility of the plans pro
moted to redeem their promises and
obligations to the last detail.
“The people of the South will be
given the first opportunity to invest
in this project, if upon rigid investiga
tion is commends itself to their
judgment.
“The backbone of the plan it a
chain of bonded warehouses through
out the South sufficient in number
and capacity to house one-third of the
crop, and that one-third, as has been
demonstrated, will be the balance of
power which will render the market
congestion impossible and insure the
disposal of the crop in strict confor
mity with the laws of supply and
demand.”
In borrowing money on his ware
house certificates, Mr. Sully said the
farmer does not surrender the equity
in his cotton. “If it is his to sell
whenever he pleases, or to hold as
long as he pleases, with the plain
busniess exception that the sertificate
he may have used as collateral for the
loan is a prior lien upon the bale
w'hich must be satisfied out of the sale
of the bale when that culmination is
reached. ’ ’
The company would be paid a nomi
nal fee for each bale of cotton handled
and in this way, Mr. Sully figures a
fair profit wnll be realized on the in
vestment.
