THE JEFFERSONIAN.
An Easy Way to Save Money
All men ought to save money.
Some men do save money.
Many men will save money, if shown an
easy way.
THE WAY.
Do a little work for The Jeffersonianss. We
will give our full agent’s commission to every
person—man, woman, or child—who will take
subscriptions for The Jeffersonians and mail
us the correct amount, and we will send them
a receipt which will be a voucher for the com
mission. When the commissions mount up to
$lO, send us the receipts and we will give you
a ten-year bond, fully guaranteed, drawing
seven per cent interest.
HOW EASY.
By a little work at odd times you can build
up a nice fund for a rainy day, a nest egg for
the baby, or insurance against sickness. It is
easy work. For instance, ©ne of our agents
went out inte a crowd the other day and teok
five subscriptions to th© Magazine and eight
subscriptions to the Weekly. Two hours’ work
netted him nearly enough money to buy one of
these $lO ten-year bonds.
BOYS AND GIRLS.
Teach your boys and girls how to save
money. In the course of the summer vacation
an active boy or girl can earn from $25 to
SSO at this work. Think how proud they will
be when they have a little bank account of
their own! They will be bond-holders—these
little folks —clipping their coupons every year,
like sure-enough millionaires.
The bonds are fully guaranteed.
They draw seven per cent interest.
Tney are the best kind of insurance.

Rheumatism
Do you want to get rid
of it ? If so, take Dr. Miles
Nervine modified as di
rected in pamphlet around
bottle. In addition to the
direct curative properties
it has a soothing effect up
on the nervous system by
which the rheumatic
pains are controlled, and
rest and sleep assured.
It has made many cures
of this painful disease,
some of them after years
of suffering. If it will
cure others why not you.
If your case is compli
cated, write us for advice,
it costs you nothing and
may save you prolonged
suffering.
“I was Jo crippled that I could
scarcely walk. After having my shoes
on for an hour or two I could manage
to walk by suffering the pain. Then
I began to have pains all through
my system. My doctor told me I had
an acute attack of inflammatory
rheumatism. I read about Dr. Miles’
Nervine, bought a bottle and I com
menced to get better from the start
and for the past six months have
scarcely any pain, and am able to
walk as well as ever.”
