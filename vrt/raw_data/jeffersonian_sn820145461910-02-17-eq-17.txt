yhich you know absolutely nothing
-*of; especially when a wrong impres
sion is conveyed.
In a sermon delivered at the
Methodist church last Sunday, the
preacher said some one tried to get
him to read your articles on For
eign Missions, but he would not,
though he arraigned you in no com
plimentary terms, and another one
that heard him remarked he called
you a fool. Giving a verdict with
out learning the evidence, which
shows his sense of justice, or rather
injustice.

AN APPRECIATED LETTER.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l have been
thinking of writing to you for some
time. I keep closely up with your
writings, being more interested in
them than any others; you handle
questions that are of vital interest
to all the people, and you are a bold,
fearless and uncompromising writer;
you are no fence-straddler; you have
an opinion on all questions, not
afraid to state it and give a reason
for it. I have voted for you every
time I had an opportunity and am
not sorry for it, either. If it was in
my power I would make you Presi
dent. Mr. Watson, your writings are
going to have a visible effect on
this country in a few years, the peo
ple are drinking it in. Your exposi
tion of the question of Missions is
going to tell very soon, the yoke of
priestcraft is getting heavy, it is gall
ing the necks of the people, and I am
glad to see you turning on the light.
The Gospel is God’s plan to save the
people, and while you expose the
rottenness of the present methods
of Foreign Missions, we must not
neglect to develop some Scriptural
methods to carry on the work, or
else you will do more harm than
good. Notwithstanding the corrup
tion of the present methods, there is
need for gospel preaching.
Mr. Watson, you have such a gift
to find out facts I have a question to
ask you: A few years ago, just be
fore the Spanish-American war, the
Southern Baptist Convention had a
missionary employed in Cuba named
Diaz;„just after the war the board
dismissed him; he came over here
to the next convention and desired
to bring his case before the conven
tion; he w r as refused a hearing, and
the great Baptist host today doesn’t
know what he was dismissed for. I
know of a great many prominent
Baptists who would be glad to know
the cause.
Yours truly,
B. L. HENCELY.

ANOTHER PREACHER OPPOSED
TO FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Dear Sir: —I am so impressed with
the articles published in The Jeffer
sonian on Foreign Missions, I want to
express my appreciation. I have
long since been convinced that this
Foreign Mission craze was a farce,
and ought to be condemned by all
true Americans. The idea of rob
bing the church treasury of this
great civilization to hire these for
eigners to be Christians, -while thou
sands of children of our blood and
nation grow up in ignorance. I be
lieve in mission work, but I believe
in it just the way the Bible teaches
it. To do more than this is to dis
grace the Writ and its teachings. To
hire a man to be a Christian is con
trary to the authorized version of the
Bible; he progresses no farther than
the money carries him. I only wish
I had all your works in full on this
great question at my command, I
feel that I would then be able to
meet the issues I have to contend
with while on my work as a minis
ter. I feel it my Christian duty to
help the needy and destitute when in
my poweer to do so, but I nowhere
find where I am required to take my
children’s bread and give it to others
and leave mine to starve. But I do
find it plainly stated that he that
provides not for his own house has
denied the faith and is worse than
an infidel.
I want The Jeffersonian and mag
azine. I will subscribe for them at
an early day. I find in them many
articles that meets my approbation.
I would like to ask some questions
for information, if it would not in
fringe on your valuable time: Ist.
What has been accomplished in the
past fifty years in foreign fields, and
what has been the amount of money
taken from this country to do what
has been done? I will write more.
Wishing The Jeffersonian success,
I am very truly yours for good in all
these great undertakings,
REV. J. J. DAVIS.

HERE ARE SOME DEEP
THOUGHTS FROM A LIT
TLE GIRL.
Dear Mr. Watson: —In the Texas
Christian Advocate I noticed a letter
from Martha Nutt, in which she
says that the Mexican girls are made
up of the same material as the girls
of the United States, and are just as
genuine as other girls. Now, Mr.
Watson, what do you think of this.
I do not think that I am any rela
tion to these Mexican girls; I do not
believe in educating them and let
ting the orphans all over the United
States die from starvation.
I do not believe that the Bible
says to educate and clothe them, for
Bible plainly says, he that provideth
not for his own, and especially for
his own household, has denied the
faith already and is worse than an
infidel.
I read in the Book, “the call of
God to men.” The authors of that
Book claim that they are going to
make the world one united brother
hood.
Mr. Watson, what I want to know
is this: how are they going to do
that?
When the apostles were preaching
in Jerusalem the people of every na
tion were there and heard the gos
pel; if this is true, and we do not
doubt it, why are we going wild
about the poor heathen; why are we
children to be taught, even in Sun
day-school, that we must sacrifice
our all to the children of heathen
lands, while so many little children
of our own race and color must
grow up in ignorance?
Mr. Watson, you are teaching us
a great many things, and we all re
gard you as our friend; when we
want to know facts which concern us
all we look to you. I expect some
times we worry you, but we have
great confidence in your patience.
I am a little girl, just twelve years
old, but I love to know facts, I love
to learn the truth.
With best wishes to you and The
Jeffersonian, I remain,
Yours sincerely,
WILLIE GENTRY.
Slocomb, Ark.
THE FARMER PAYS THE
FREIGHT, THE POLITICIANS
GET THE MONEY.
Hon. T. E. Watson: —I am satis
fied it is a pleasure to you to hear
from your friends, which I believe
you have all over the United State.
No man can read your editorials and
remain in either of the old parties,
if he will only stop and think. Both
county and State officials, servants
of the people, pervert the law and
trample it under foot. You point
out the wrongs and the remedy.
Therefore, I can’t see why, in the
name of God, people can’t see what
will inevitably be the result. Would
to God that I had money to advance
a\\ / 11 11 1
Jeffersonian
the cause. The common peoples'
fight is for fair play. From county
commissioner to the Presidency it is
graft and fraud on every side. If a
farmer makes a good crop they swin
dle him out of it—the classes array
ed against the masses’ History re
peats itself, as you said in your
speech of acceptance as our candi
date for the highest office in the
land. O, when I read that address
how it increased my admiration for
you! The champion of equal rights
to all, and not a favored few', who
are organized to rob the poor and
helpless, who could help themselves
if they w'ould only do it, and w'ould
if they had a leader in every county
in the State of Oklahoma.
I am a poor, landless man, with
out a home of my own, but conscious
of the fact that I have discharged all
of the duties of good citizenship, and
that is some satisfaction to me in
my old age.
Hoping that you may have long
life and prosper, and that our side
of the political question may finally
triumph, I am,
Very respectfully,
A READER AND SUBSCRIBER.
A DOMESTIC MISSION SUGGES
TION.
Dear Mr. Watson:—Enclosed you
will find a clipping from “Comfort,”
of Augusta, Me., which please read
and publish with Uncle Charlie’s re
ply.
I think it is a shame for the peo
of Georgia to neglect our own peo
ple for the African negro, China
man and other races. If this man
was an African negro, there would
have been sent enough money to
support him and his mother.
I would like to know w’hat the
“Home Missionary Society” in Dal
ton is doing. I am a Methodist al
right, but don’t believe in this For
eign Mission we have on foot. And
if you stop the “rake-off” we would
have Jess Foreign Mission and more
Home Missions.
1 believe a certain one in all our
churches should be appointed to in
vestigate in certain localities the
wants and needs of the people. In
this way the people w'ho are neg
lected could be relieved. “Have
you thought of it, Mr. Watson?” the
parsons are not down on you any
more on the subject of missions than
they are on your political views.
