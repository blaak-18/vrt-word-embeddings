On aeeonnt of space we are preo
vented from giving this amateur
troupe a more extended notice. Last
Monday they gave their firt enter
tainment to a crowded house. The
grand opening was equal to any we
have seen, and it has as been pro.m
iounced by all who witnessed it; the
gags were rich and ceenmy. The
inlys were carried out splendid anil
the singing was beatmi0fl. Take it
all in all it was a thit.elass show.
Tihs, it will he men, from the large
audience, that "home talent" Is high
ly appreciated. The Home Minstrels
will give another entertainment
iWednesday, Jaope 18th. All those who
were not fortunate enough to witness
the first entertainment, will now have
a chance to see a hat kind of metal
thie 'Natchichies hays" are on the
"hnrnt corke style." Give them a
"big house."

Hall resists and is kill.
ed-A Sad Story of
the Captured
One.
Sunday night about ldeven o'clock as
we were wending our way homeward in
company with a few friends who reside
in the same neighborhood, we met at the
corner of Second and Nt. Deals streets.
two men, apparently strangers, who
were riding larg horses, hbut owl to
the daukneas created on that corner by a
live-oak tree, we were unable to distin.
guish the color of the horses, but the
features of the men were esily distin
guished that they were wbhte, they in
quired of as for the livery stable, they
were shown two places; at the time we
considered this rather strange for any
one to inquire for a livery stable, as
every body in this parish is supposed to
know where it is; after reeonsidering
matters, we came to the couealuson that
as the District Court was in session, no
doubt they were from a loeg distance,
and were either summoned as witnesses
in some important eae or a civil sait in
Court. Next evening we learned that
the men we had seen were horse thieves
who had stolen on Friday night, June
6th. two horses. one bay and the other
dark sorrel, from the stable of a widow
lady, tour iilem east of Marshall, Har
rison eounnty. Texas, and had been trae.k
eel by the Teas pesse from the stable
down as far as Manaseld, where Deputy
Shrift Hewitt, with a po as took one
road and the Texa posse took another,
so that the thieves would have no chance
to eeape theeluthes of the law. Depn
ty 8beriff Hewitt arrived here Monday
with his. posse, learning that be was on
the "hbot trail," ebanged horses for
fresher ones at Messrs. Hies & Htaon's
lively stable that he migt overtake
ihemn at Monett's ferry. Mr. Hewitt in
formed as that all the way down the
river he received eneouraging news
almoat the thieves, and lost no time in
ugainingl, on them; he asaj that on Tues
dlay, as day conmenced to dawn, they
were 4"l miles from this city, when lie
saw tweo horses in ano opening near a
honse, presently he saw two men, he or
dered his men to stick spurs to their
steeds to p,revesnt the ".lirds" from hav
ing a chance to make their erecap or to
get the use of their weapcons. In an in.
.tarnt they were on the fslgitives, throw -
ing" them coumpletely off their guardl,
th y dismlouunteld, leveled their guns at
them nd orderled then, to throw up their
hands, Willis.. C. Payne lieas P. B.
Hicks, complllied with tie order, but E.
W. Hall acted stubborn habot the nmat.
ter ansd ddll.d the authorities. He was
told by Mr Hewi t not to make any de
monstrations to draw a weapon, as he
wonld be killed, to this Hall replied that
they eoaldl kill, he wnl's afraidl to die,
hle then attempted to get hie pistol from
lis saddle, whirb was lying on the
ground, when the poses rtl, killing
him instantly. Hicks was then tied t.. a
hlere andm brought to town, and on their
return they were met by the Texas posse
who lhad Just arrived in town Hicks
was placed in Jail until next day, when
he was taken to Maneaeld, there to #wait
a requisition from Texas.
On Wedneatwey morning weu.alled on
Hicks at the jail for bhi. statemeati we
oaund him to be a ose looking young
mani shout 18 or 19 years if age, very 1
sociable in mtnnei r sad presents a gens
ilemanly appearance, we told him our
Iusiness, and he replied that he was
tory glad to have the oportunity of
having his statement published, we
mentioned what a serious thini this was
for a yonu ngman of his age to bee aunght
in; he replied, "I don't want ny man's
synipatnr in this matter, until I can
satisfy tte minds in all how I came into
posseason of tnhat horse, and alsm how I
eamen to he amociSted with Hall..
The folidwing is his statemenat:

and fill determination to carry out both
I the letter as well as tile spirit of our
criminalstatutes; it is also due to the
prompt punishmaent of those who have
been found guilty of fractious of existing
criminal statutes. It is a matter of sin
cere conglatulation -to the people, to
you- honorable court, as well a our
selves, that this state of exemption ex
ists throughosut the parish and among all
chlasses of our citizens. There is one
grave infraction of law which has been
an unmitigated crime under the statutes
and to which your honor called our spe
cial attention in your most exeellent
ebarge, that has more particularly em
plo ed our time than any other subject
- that is the almost nmimal practice of
Scarrying
CONxcaL.) WAIONS.
SUnder the sanctity of our oath a Grand
Jurors, witbhout fear or fhar, we have
presented oeighteen bill of indiotment
against citizens who have infrined this
law. It is an evil wbich is now attract
ing univeral attention aind against
whieh the lei ivelg machinery of a
number of States, as well as the police
regulations of several large cities have
been direeted. It is to be hoped that a
law will be enacted by the Coetitation
al Convention now n sessiaon, making it
not merely a matter of fne and imprison.
ment in the parish jail, but a penal of
tense. Thus and thus only, will the lives
of eitisens be protected from the casual
ties which are the result of the repreheo.
nible practice. Nearly every indictment
by your present Grand Joury has been
the result of carrying concealed weapons
PCI,c ROANs.
We have extended our investigations
into all matters preerated to as. We rae
loth to call attention to the condition of
the public reed% Existing laws seem
inadequate to enfore labor on the public
roals, and it is diaeretionary with over
seers when they shall work thes high
ways. Our pareohial legislative body
shbould fi stated seasons for working the
roads, and then are to it that the ordin
ances enacted are enforced, and over.
seers as well as bands promptly indicted
and' punished for their infringements.
The condition of

There is also a gmes negligence in re
gard to sign posts at cros-roads, and
Sie-posts along principal thoroughfares.
The laws in regard to these matters are
as a dead-letter among the ordinances of
the Police Jury, and should either be ex
punged or rigidly enforced.
