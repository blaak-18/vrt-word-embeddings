PAGE FOUR
VERY whipstitch, some
facile space writer like
Dorothy Dix, seems to
run out of a new subject
and proceeds to rehash
some hackneyed “Don’ts
for Women,” of which
there are apparently no
end. A favorite theme is
Loneliness. Some one, —maybe the re
cluse of the hall-bedroom in a big
city, or the village hermit, or
she who is cloistered upon an
out-of-the-way farm, —writes a pa
thetic little plea complaining of
an isolation most dreary. Whereup
on. the reading world, over her shoul
der, again is treated to a trite homily
on how to be popular. Fair phrases
and maternal counsel prevail, but the
darkling significance of it all is this:
Don’t be selfish; and Don’t be rude.
It is a cruel answer and must never
yet have failed to crush the timid cor
respondent, for thus far none of the: .
has ever mustered the spunk to hand
back the bunch of advice with a firm,
polite, No, thank you. Os course,
you understand it doesn’t take a very
great deal to blight those already
withered by the frost of an uncon
genial atmosphere. So the cold cor
rection has quite annihilated the un
happy wights. Yet a thought must
convince any one of sympathetic in
sight that the rudenes, selfishness, lack
of interest in others, tactlessness and
general lack of adaptability charged
against the lonely one, would apply
far more appropriately to those in
whose power it lies to promote the de
sired and innocent girlish good time,
and who remain so serenely indifferent
to any social obligations aside from
those familiar to “our set.”
The saddest life in the world is per
haps the one which would scarcely
dare confess itself sad: where the
ache of daily dullness and heart-hun
ger amounts to a constant inner trag
edy, but which makes no claim upon
the consideration of the heedless, such
as would the events we are so apt to
term “real sorrows.” For the latter
there is usually a temporary regret, at
least, which expresses itself in some
kindly word or deed to lighten the
load. For the former, the world has
yet no tolerance. While it may be
too much to hope that humanity yet
scarcely civilized may become social
ized at an early day, it is certain
it will get little forwarder so. long as
the views of the superficial remain
undenied.
In the first place, the feminine suf
ferer from loneliness cannot help'her
sex, and the restrictions placed upon
her by iron-clad convention are the
main cause of her complete isolation,
when she chances to be born outside
of, or to drift, through family re
verses, away from a leisurely, com
fortable, cheery social environment.
Contrast the condition of the young
business man with that of the girl in
commercial life. Fine character, good
breeding, pleasant disposition may be
equal in both, but he is valuable as
an escort, a filler-in at dinner, a
partner in the dance, and without
some very special accomplishment she
would be worse than the “superfluous
woman.” Even if society, in the or-
Under The Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
dinary sense of the term, were man
aged on an unselfish plan, the self
respecting girl could not accept any
thing that savored of patronage. Left,
therefore, to herself, what remains?
Simply the daylight hours spent at
definite duties within four walls; and
the evening’s boredom. Park, library,
theater, lecture-hall —are not in many
cases or places possible for the un
escorted woman. She may not en
joy the most harmless diversions
alone. What solace within doors?
The boarding house parlor or piazza
is monopolized mostly by cads and
cats. The private family is generally
so obviously reluctant to have her
upon any terms, and so engrossed in
its own affairs, that she feels herself
to be an intruder if she ventures be
yond her own room. How can she
avoid the sense of not being wanted
anywhere ?
As for the multitude of working
girls of less culture, the words of
Miss Jane Addams may with profit
be pitted against the opinions of the
Sunday Supplement pen-seratcher:
“For the first time, girls are being
prized more for their labor power
than for their innocence, their tender
beauty, their ephemeral gayety. So
ciety cares more for the products they
manufacture than for their immemo
rial ability to knead over the bread
of life and reaffirm the charm of ex
istence. The love of pleasure will not
be denied, and when no adequate pro
vision is made for its expression, it
turns into all sorts of malignant and
vicious appetites In every
city arise so-called ‘places,’—gin pal
aces they are called in fiction, —in
which alcohol is dispensed; huge
dance halls are opened, to which
young people are attracted, standing
wistfully outside a roped circle, for
within it five cents will procure for
five minutes the sense of allurement
and intoxication which is sold in lieu
of innocent pleasure. These coarse
and illicit merrymakings remind one
of the unrestrained jollities of Resto
ration London, confusing joy with lust
and gayety with debauchery.”
0, poor little girl who cannot for
get the refinements of “the home
you had before father died,” you are
one of those bluntly told that you are
isolated because you are a silly young
prig, a morbid mope, an insufferable
bore!* And each evening that suc
ceeds the weary day, makes the mem
ory of the old. training weaker, the
lure of such pleasures stronger. Pres
ently, in desperation, you will join the
still poorer creatures, scarcely more
than children, who have yielded to the
lure, or grown up knowing nothing
better.
Now the girl who is sidetracked in
the small community—is she always
to blame? Or isn’t the community
sometimes closing its doors against her
because her father drank, or her un
cle was a black-sheep, or the family is
shiftless, or some remote ancestor
made himself odious? 0, the hide
bound, prejudiced country town, that
holds the children responsible for all
the evils that ever befell the fore
fathers. We all know it. There is
so wide a difference between Miss
Seminary and Little District School;
3fcffersoniait
such an impassable gulf between the
toilette evolved by the local dress
maker and the home-made frock.
There is such constant care lest hospi
tality might be extended to those who
really need it!
As for the farmer’s daughter, again
the loneliness is largely a question of
sex. The men and boys come and go
freely, but it is neither convenient,
nor safe, for the girls to do much
visiting. Particularly is this true in
the South, where the black shadow
hangs over every wood and field and
highway.
No, Dorothy Dix and othets, the
lonely girl is not herself to blame, in
999 out of 1,000 cases. The pitiful
appeal she makes to you, and which
she would be too proud to utter if she
thought her real identity would be
discovered, is an indictment against
the coldness of society in general.
Snobbery is not confined to the big
cities. It lurks in the country as wel].
And Mrs. Moneybags continues to be
besieged with invitations which are
treated with real or affected noncha
lance, while Miss Penniless grows
warped and embittered in an unde
served neglect.
This being true, I feel like gather
ing the forlorn little sister to me, just
as I would a wistful baby shut out by
his thoughtless fellows, and saying:
“Never mind! Good books will never
fail, good work is needing to be done
and there are lots of folk just as lone
ly as you are, whom you may cheer
up. Don’t torment yourself with
introspection. Should, fame or for
tune come your way, you would need
a few personal peculiarities, anyhow,
for advertising purposes. If you
want’ to win appreciation, and the
good opinion of others, you are not
apt to be hiding any really wrong
thoughts or ugly traits within your
soul. The very best men and women
have often to meet and vanquish envy,
spite, malice and indifference. And,
no matter how bleak the present out
look, there is one unfailing rule that
will bring all and more of the com
pany you crave. ‘Let a man do
something better than any other man
can do it, and the multitude will break
a path to his door, even though he live
in an unbroken wilderness.’
The quotation may not be exact,
but is just as inspiring as though it
were. The finest kind of popularity is
that which comes by reason of what
you do, not because of the surrender
of principle or of individuality—and
most recipes for obtaining social fa
vor involve just such surrenders. For
get about being slighted, do something
worth while, and presently you will be
of the elect. And when you are, you
will remember to not only keep the
latch-string out, so that the lonely
ones may freely enter the atmosphere
of warmth and cheer with which you
will surround yourself; but you will
think betimes of those who may be too
diffident to accept the silent invita
tion. You will go out and find the
unhappy little creature who is suf
fering just as you suffered, smooth
some of the rough places out of her
path and bring into her life the
touch of personal interest and tender
sympathy so long denied to you.”
DADDY’S LULLABY.
Sing me to sleep, little girl, sing on,
Fondly my heart implores you;
And while you are singing a good
night song,
Remember your Daddy adores you.
Sing, and recall, while glad the strain
floats
Adrift, like a dream, on the river,
Whatever the world holds, good or ill,
That my heart is your own forever.
iSing, little girl, sing bold, sing mild,
And never mind foe or scoffer;
Dream that your Daddy would give to
his child
'The best.that the world can offer.
Instead of the cabin and barren wall,
Dream that the place is a palace;
Dream that old Daddy is king of it all,
And you are the Princess Alice.
Dream the little old half-worn shoe
Is a slipper gay and golden;
That the Prince is coming along for
you,
Like the Prince in the story olden.
Dream that your back will never know
weight,
And never a grief must carry,
For your Daddy is one of the Magi
great,
And you are his dearest fairy.
Then sing, little girl, sing on, sing
Who said that my child was crying?
Who said that her song was a make
belive ?
That her poor old Daddy is dying?
Oh, sing little girl, and never give
heed
To their/foolish old chat, I implore
you; x
For Daddy’ll come back to you, living
or dead,
To watch with the angels o’er you.
But should he come back here and find
you sad,
Some beautiful far to-morrow,
His heart, in heaven, could never be
glad,
But would break for your sake with
sorrow.
Then sing, little girl, sing loud, sing
clear,
Though the frost on the red rose
glistens;
And be sure, somehow, little girl,
somewhere,
That your dear old Daddy still lis
tens.
—W. A. Dromgoole, in Nashville Ban
ner.
