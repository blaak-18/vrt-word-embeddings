treasury to be loaned to the banks
of the state in order to relieve the
strained financial condition of the
country and that Governor Pindal
is quoted as saying that there is now
probably $1,500,000 in the vaults of
the state.
I am not familiar enough with the
financial problem of the country to
know the cause of the present strin
gency in money matters, bjit it is
strange that, when the country is ap
parently in a prosperous condition,
it should be in the midst of a
financial panic, and that the crisis
should come just at this time when
money is needed most in the South
to handle the cotton crop and enable
the farmer to demand reasonable
prices.
It is a well known fact that farm
ers through their unions are getting
in a position where they can fix the
price of their own products and the
local banks of the country are willing
to assist them to hold their cotton
until they are offered the price fixed
by the unions. At this juncture the
local banks are notified by the banks
in the East in which they have money
on deposit, that they. cannot draw
any of that money, and thus it stands.
What is the matter? Is the whole
thing a scheme by eastern financiers,
speculators and capitalists to thwart
the efforts of the farmers and force
them now, as they have in the past,
to take for their cotton what the
speculators are willing to give?
I believe that the- banks of the
South will be able to handle the
proposition and that any scheme of
eastern capitalists will be defeated.
The banks throughout this state are
in good condition and cannot be
crushed by any financial scheme. I
refer with pride to the three banks
of Mena which are doing business at
the same old stand in the same old
way, unaffected by the panicky
whirlwind which has caused the
banks in the larger cities to restrict
the amounts that may be drawn by
depositors. I have investigated the
situation here and find that our banks
do not want to borrow money from
any other source to transact their
business just as they have been
doing. Ts the farmers and their
local banks will co-operate they both
can stand “pat,” without the aid or
consent of the East.
However, if the state wants to help
the farmers and has money to loan,
why not let the farmers have it direct
and take cotton as security? Time
and space forbid going to details
as to the plans, but the state could
have an agent at each county seat
who would be authorized to advance
so much money on each bale of cotton
as shown by warehouse receipt.
If cotton is good security to com
mission men and banks, why is it
not good security to the state?
Why should the state loan the mon
ey to the banks at four or six per
cent and let the banks in turn loan
to the farmers at ten per cent? You
say this is populistic. party doctrine.
Suppose it is, the democratic party
in the last ten years have appropriat
ed many populistic doctrines. No po
litical party has a patent right on
any theory of government. The best
laws of the republic adminstration
were first advocated by the demo
cratic party. Democracy is opposed
to a government of either paternal-
ism or special privileges, but if we
must have either one of the other, is
not paternalism better for the whole
people ?
I am for anything that is practi
cable and right, that will assist the
farmers, to fix the price of their prod
ucts. The laywer fixes his fee, the
doctor fixes the price of his services
the merchant prices his goods, the
carpenter, the brick mason and the
painter fix their wages, etc. The
farmers of the country are about the
only people who have let others say
what they shall receive for their
honest toil. HAL L. NORWOOD.
A WORD TO HOLDERS OF
COTTON.
For two weeks the cotton market
has ben peursuing the course that it
seemed to us natural and inevitabble
it should pursue. There was a long
period of weakness while demand
from American mills was light. Then
there was a sympathetic collapse
during the acute stage of the panic,
and then, having a naturally strong
position, cotton made early recovery.
During fifteen days the spot market
has experienced a number of ad
vances, and has not lost a point, with
the result that good middling is bet
ter than 12 cents in New York, and
just a little off 12 cents in Columbia.
It is not material now why the de
mand from American mills was light,
it is probable, however, that in the
early fall they hoped to bear the
market, and that they were further
encouraged to stay off the market by
the difficulty experienced in securing
necessary funds to lay in large stocks.
During the panic, when prices were
tumbling, there was ractically no
domestic demand for cotton because
of the inability to command cash.
Fortunately for the South, cotton
growers “stood steady,” and there
was no scramble to sell for what it
would fetch. That would have been
the course a decade ago, because the
farmers were financially weaker, and
had no sustaining organization.
But the cotton grower has not
passed the Rubicon. During the
period of depression, when those
that might have sold a few weeks
earlier for S6O a bale, saw SSO a bale
quoted, there were doubtless many
that made solemn promise to them
selves and to their creditors to sell
“just as soon as cotton gets back
to 12 cents.” Now, those that have
determined to sell for 12 cents, those
that will not risk holding for more,
or that are under obligation to sell
for 12 cents, must be expected to
sell. But for self-protection as well
as for the protection of other holders
of cotton they must also determine
not to sell a point less than 12 cents.
Unless that determination is made,
the result will be as we here outline
it: The first day cotton touches S6O
a bale, a great quantity will be offer
ed; it will be absorbed at that price,
but the mark t will close weaker,
the day following much more will be
brought to market to be sold for 12
cents. If any considerable part of
these holders sell when offered $59.50
a bale then theqprice will continue to
drop just in proportion to the free
dom of offerings.
The natural position of cotton is
strong. There may be a little
recession because of heavy offerings
by the thousands wishing more cash

for the Christmas trade, but the ad
vance is bound to be again taken up,
and we see 13-cent cotton in the very
early future. Much, however, de
pends upon the farmer. He must sell
with discretion; that will strengthen
the position of those who are able
to hold indefinitely.—Columbia State.
HOLD YOUR COTTON.
My name is Charles Tucker —
My name I’ll never deny —
I’m a union farmer,
And shall be till I die.
Now, brothers, hold your cotton,
The crop is very light,
The price that we’re asking
Is now almost in sight.
I got the editor’s letter
That he sent out to me —
Asking me to write him
From this locality.
I
I’ll put it in a rhyme, .
And thus compose a song—
The cotton patch is empty,
The crop is almost gone.
Our cotton’s in the warehouse,
With wrapping all around,
Waiting for the spinners
At 15 cents a pound.
The seed is put in houses,
To keep it off the ground,
Or carried to the oil mill
At just 1 cent a pound.

THE COTTON REPORT.
It was not surprising that the
price of cotton futures on the floor
of the New Orleans cotton exchange
had a bearish tendency as a result of
the report of the cotton production
in the United States, issued by the
department of agriculture. Neither
is it surprising that this bearish
tendency was checked by the large
number of orders to buy following
the recession in values. The govern
ment’s estimate was larger than was
expected. This estimate is not
necessarily accurate. It is based on
reports from agents and correspond
ents who are by no means infallible,
and their reports are in considerable
part only estimates made up from
reports of individuals and locali
ties. The government’s reports are
liable to be erroneous; they are some
times notably inaccurate, and of late
years there is perhaps less confidence
put in them by the farmers if not by
buyers, manufacturers and conserva
tive students of agricultural con
ditions.
The crop for 1907 (not including
linters) is estimated by the depart
ment of agricultural at 11,678,000
bales of 5000 pounds each. This
estimate is based upon the amount
already ginned as compared with
former years together with as close
estimates of the acreage as could be
obtained, leaving the matter of how
much of the product is being held
by farmers for higher prices more
or less a question of speculation.
But even if there is a larger crop
than was expected this does not
necessarily mean that a good price
will not be maintained. The de
mand for cotton as a result of its
wider use the world over is gradually
increasing. More cotton is needed
at home, as a result of our steadily
increasing population, as well as
abroad, than there was even a few
years ago. Moreover, the cotton
planters of the Southern states are
in better financial condition than for
years, and a larger proportion of
them can hold on to their crops
longer than usual. There is a strong
tendency to do this, and the effect
is almost sure to be an increase in
prices later on. It is hardly probable
that until the price advances to 12 1-2
or 13 cents will there be a free move
ment of the staple. The disposition
on the part of many to hold out for
15 cents will naturally have effect on
the market.
Taking everything into consider
ation the prospects for prices that
will yield a good profit to the South
ern farmer are encouraging, and the
farmer knows it. He is doing
“pretty well, thank you.” this year.

Many districts of the Western
states which make a specialty of
growing cantaloupes have been struck
with a blight which seems to have
been to some extent brought on and
aggravated by rains and heavy dews,
and which does not seem to be ma
terially checked by any spray that
has yet been tried. Headway in fight
ing the disease seems to have been
made chiefly along the line of rota
tion of crops and the planting of
disease resistant seed.
One changes gives a good
story on a certain minister as fol

spoken of goes to church Sunday
morning in a carriage. He received
an anonymous letter recently calling
his attention to the fact that “the
Lord never rode to church in a car
riage. ” The minister read the let

A neighbor exchange says once
one of his subscribers received a dun
through the post office, and it made
him mad. He went to see the editor
about it, and the editor showed him
a few duns of his own—one for pa
per, one for type, one for rent and
several others. “Now,” said the ed
itor, “I didn’t get mad when these
came, because I knew that all I had
to do was to ask several reliable gen
tlemen like you to come and help me
out, and then I could settle all of
them.” When the subscriber saw
how it was, he repented, paid up and
renewed for another year.
