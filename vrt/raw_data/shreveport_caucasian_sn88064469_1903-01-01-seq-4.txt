If it was suggested ai a fat. it is inde
fensitle. If it was inttended to supplant
the musical rythmn of the Southern
man's pronunciation andl articulation of
plain English words. failure is stamped
on the effort.
It is not possible to defend it on any
reasonable ground. The "up-to-date"
articulation and pronunciation of Eng
lish words with the Yankee twang as
an additional contribution to an affected
style of speech is ridiculous. Why should
Southern teachers, educators of the
girls and boys of Southern men. borrow
any Yankee twang innovation when
there is so much beauty and musical ca
dence in the articulation and the pro
nunciation of English words---the Eng
lish language as it has been spoken by
the greatest men of the South and as
Southern men propose to speak it.
KANSAS 3LYNCHERS.
A negro. Montgomery Godlcy. was
lynched at Pittsburg. Kas.. on Christ
mas day by a mob of white men. There
is nothing singular in a negro having
been lynched, but the Kansas lynchers
hanged an innocent man. It has been
discovered that the policeman killed was
shot by Joe Godley, ao brother of the
dead negro. Joe escaped during the
lynching of his brother who pleaded for
his life, for a little time in which to
prove that he was not guilty, but the
Kansas lynchers who howled for his life
were deaf to all his entreaties, and this
too in a State which has 'always been
with the foremost in declarations of love
for the negro: a State where, in many
instances, the negro is socially on a level
with the white man. The negro, if guilty,
should not have been mobbed. If a ne
gro had killed a policeman in Shreve
port he would have been arrested, jailed.
tried fairly and hanged legally. But if
the negro had been guilty of an assault
upon a white woman, he would have
been hanged beyond all restraint of the
legal authorities. This is the difference
in the treatment of negroes in louis
iana and in Kansas or other State of the
North where'canting hypherites are al
ways ready with their denunciations of
the South. The Kansas lynchers. as the
Indiana lynchers and others of the
howling, sanctimonious, two - faced
skunks, the strenuous of the North who
would read a chapter on morals to the
people of the South who will protect
their homes nad their civilization re
gardless of the cants of the howlers, are
advised to direct their reforms to their
own people, % ho wantonly drive from
their midst the negro who may have in
curred their displeasure and lynch the
negro who is innocent of crime.
Will this hncident arouse Massachu
setts and Maine and the other states of
the North to a protest of indignation or
will their wrath be reserved for furious
belching when a negro may be hanged
in the South for having outraged a
woman. It is beginning to dawn on civ
ilized communities that missionaries
must soon be called into the field to en
lighten and hear the gospel of peace and
love .to the beninghted people of the
North.
Those Hamilton (0.) ministers who
burred Santa Claus from their churches
