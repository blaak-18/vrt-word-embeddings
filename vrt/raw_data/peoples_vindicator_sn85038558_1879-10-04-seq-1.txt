OVER THE BARS.
'Twa. mikling time, and the cows came
Fromthe meadows sweet with clover;
And stood in the lane, while pretty Jane
HBad quiet chat with the drover
Such a quiet chat that It leareely seemed
That a single word was spoken ;
While a maric spell with night dews fell,
And the rhyme of song was spoken
The cattle stood at the lovers 'side,
Witheout any show of vexation,
As thong imipressed that a live-bar rest
Was a part of their restoration.
And as Jan listened to the notes that
caseme
Ribght nder the bars and over,
Her heart took wing, the sil thing,
And nestle up close to the dr0wer.
She heard himtla' his home was poor,
.That h"'d nothieg butlove to gis heta;
And she amiled conteant,s lehoug lov
had spent
Every arrow be had in his quiver ;
And abe mmiled: eonteut, wheo the ve.
ningir " ,. .
:With voices of birds ar ringing,.
And her lipseoufeesed that. lowy aest
leould never prevent her singlng. -
o over the bars the lovers lean,
In the joy of their sweet eemrniounle
And their looks declared that povrty neer
