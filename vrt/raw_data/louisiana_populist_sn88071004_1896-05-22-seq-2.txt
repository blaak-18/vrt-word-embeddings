FRIDAY, May 22, 1896. fi(

A man who would be willing to
endorse the steal of a State, would nit
steal a parish if he could get away he
with it. o0

It is a line which requires a
peculiar eye to discern, that di- Cb
vides political dishonesty from per
so:lal dishonesty, and thank .God f
we do not own such an optic.
Any man that will rob the peo- off
ple of their votes will rob a widow bib
and orphan of their property, if tic
the law or public sentiment will vel
permit it. do:

No election is a fair election that or
will turn the State out of the fai
hands of the Democratic party. leg
They consider it is fair to beat be(
their opponents even if to do so all loc
honor is violated. via
The Board of Supervisors for
this parish counted the stuffed the
and fraudulent ward 6 box, but pla
threw out the ward 3 box, where she
every thing was fair and lawful. but
Yet we presume these men claim a
to be honest and impartial. me

We are very much surprised to qui
know that Mr. J. W. Freeman he
Claims the Sheriff's ofco, to which con
Mr. Jones is clearly elected. From eb
his many expressions of fair deal- par
ing before the election, Mr. Free- ele
man has somewhat receded. euc1
Foster is willing for the people te
to have a convention, or anything
else they want when their wants smri
do mot coneaflict with his own per- P"

ST. Retrospection aund a Proposl
lion.
IE . l'o ult :
The smoke of the battle has
cleared away and we can now look I
over the field and see the number
left among the slain, and examine
litor. those who are sorely wounded, and
sher. cogitate as to the causes that went
to make up the result. We have
been charged as being a party
4t made upI of oflice-hunters, and
while there are not half as many in
our ranks in proportion to the vo
ters as in the old parties, yet the
20no fact that there were too many of
n on that class, had much to do with
o nn the result of the late election in
a oour State.
- There are nnny parishes in the
-t in State that should have given a large
majority for governor and legisla
centture that only nule proof that
greed for local office will destroy
S"pr the chances of any great reform
movement where this greed is per
inre
oby mitted.to control. Our sister par
monltl ishes of Sabine, Vernon, Lincoln
. tnd Union, are illustrations of
game what can be done in disrupting a
pmrty in the scramble for local of
flees. Our people as a party are
for great National andl State re
ost forms, and not the vehicles through
me which certain individuals shall be I
pat into office, and made to draw
fat salaries.
to Change of office from one setof E
ki men to another is not the object,
iay but comes only incidently. The
offices must be filled, andt we want
them filled with friends to our
di- cause, but when it comes about e
er- that the struggle between these
a friends has the tendency to weaken r
and destroy us, it would be much
better for reform if there were no a
o-offices for which to strnigle. Sa
ow bin should have given the State ti
if ticket 800 or 900 majority at the
,ill very lowest. Vernon should have
done almost as well, Lincoln could
have given 1000. Union as much
'at or more. Several other parishes
he failed to elect their members to the
Y. legisture from our party simply
at because there was a struggle for
all local offices which brought on di- ai
vision, dissention and defoeat. L
or Now Mr. President. "1 move" g
od that we add one more plank to our
ut platform, and it is this. "No man
re shall seek local office of emolument
l. but await the call from the people, R
m and as soon as it is known that any
member of the People's party is
waiting for such a call, he be re- it'
to quired to resign from any position w
in he may hold on any of its various lit
h committees, and that thereafter he i
m shall be debarred from acting in of
L1- party official capacity until he is m
e- elected to office, or his defeat for
such office be officially promulga- th
le ted." ur
This would place any man de- P
ts siring to be a cadidate in such a bi
- position that his personal interests
im his own election could not en
Sdanger the success of the party,
for he would no longer have any
voice in its councils. Then the
party after its nominations are cal
made should be as honorable as all sp
* other parties are, and stand by its Sa
Snolminees. There are some politi- an
• cal organizations that debar any HI
, of their members from rumnin ar
s for ooce of any character, for cal
I they bold their members solidly to- he
gether, prepared to east their
I strength solidly for either of two pl
candidates pat up by other party wh
organizations or for an independ- bet
ent. The plan if adopted by us im]
Smight work well for m u a State Hi
and Nationas party, but we need Cre

- The Biennial Report of tile State
, Treasurer of ALouisiana, for"). ':,1;,
t will carry into oithIcial history the
- following burning truths:
Having discharged the duties of
S State Treasurer during the last
four years to the best of my ability,
andt while conceding to others the
same honesty of purpose which I
) claim for myself in the perform
e ance of my official duties for the
good of the whole people, to whom
I am accountable, myv term of office
mdraws to a close with a full sense
of having impartially and honest
e ly performed all the duties ilupos
ed on me as Treasurer.
During the recent general elec
tion my name was submitted to the
people of the State for re-election
as Treasurer. I amn honest in the
belief, and believe that the best
people of the State. regardless of
their political affiliations, believe
that I have received( not only a ma
t jority of the whole vote honestly
cast, but a malority of the intelli
gent white vote.
It now looks as if the will of the
people, as expressed at the ballot
box, is to Ite (lisregar(ded. If I
am deprived of this victory it will
be through- the perpetration of
such election frauds as have never
before been experienced in the
history of the State of Louisiana.
Information from reputable men
in many of the parishes of the
State, and a personal inspection of
the election returns in the office of
thetSecretary of State, justifies me
in coming to the conclusion that
there is a deep-laid scheme to an
nul the expressed will of the peo
ple and deprive me of the position
I am entitled to.
Respectfully submitted,
JOHN PICKETT,
Treasurer State of Louisiana.
