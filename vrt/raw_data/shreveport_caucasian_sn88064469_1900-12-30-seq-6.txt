VITS OF THE HOUSE.
HUMORISTS WHO ENLIVEN THE PRO
CEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
Chief Among Them I. "Private"

Term-His Mantle Likely to Fall on
Chbamp Clark.
[Special Correspondence.]
WASTHJAGTON, Dec. 24. - Every con
gress has its humorist, and some of
them have half a dozen. There is al
ways some member whose keen wit,
mirth provoking drollery and talent as
a story teller make him a distinctive
character among' his fellows. Such a
character was the late S. S. Cox, who
years ago was recognized as the hu
mnorist of the house of representatives,
though he was much more than a 1u
wtorist. So. indeed, have been most of
the so called funny men of congress.

speaker, though he was recognized as
fully competent for that position.
W~liam E. Mason, now Illinols' jun.
Rer senator, won much distinction as a
&...,lt.and story teller while serving in
the house. And there are others. The
greatest of these, however. is "Private"
John M. Allen of Mississippi. who Is
now serving his last term in congress,
haying refused unanimous renomina
tion and certain re-election. For 15
years there has tben none to contest
his pre-eminence as the humorist of
'she house, and all of his colleagues
who have been re-elected to the Fifty
seventh congress sincerely regret that
he is not to return, a regret shared
alike by Republicans and Democrats
and even by those who have had occa
lon to wince under the shafts of his
keen wit. -Mr. Allen is a pronounced
partisan, and his speeches are often,
leveled at the Republicans or at some
particular Republican member, but
there, is no venom In his humor, and
his opponents laugh as heartily as his
Democratic colleagues at the droll sto

QUAIL SHOOTING IN VIRGINIA
Rare Sport it Ia Hunting the Gamy
Little Bobwhite.
[Special Correspondence 1
HANOVER. Va., Dec. 24.-Virginia, the
"mother of states and statesmen," is,
with all its other attractions, the para
dise of sportsmen. With dog and gun.
It seems to me, a man can have more
sport right here in old Virginia than
almost anywhere else in the country,
or at least anywhere within reasonable
distance of the centers of population.
This Is the home of bobwhite, the
gamiest of game birds. The season for
the shooting of quail in this state is
now well advanced-in some counties
it is almost over-but there Is still op
portunity for bunting in this section,
and with a keen scented pointer one
can readily raise a covey of birds, and
if he is a reasonably good shot he
ought to be able to take a good bag of
game. The open season in this county
and in many other of the counties con
tinues until Feb. 1 and in a few of the
counties until the 14th of February.
The quail is so thoroughly identified
with this state that naturalists have,
In addition to its genus name, ortyx,
AFTER QUAIL IN VINGINIA.
designated It Virgtnianus-a just trib
ute. for nearly every hill and dale of
the Old Dominion holds its bevy of
these little brown "bords." as they are
fondly called by the natives. But few
sectIons of the state are without them.
and the scarcity of the birds in those
sections, if scarcity It can be called, is
caused by the prosperous cattle gras
ers reducing the plantatons to grass.
thus destroying the cover in which the
quail love to dwell. Bobwhite is one
of the most domestic ot all the wild
bird family. His disposition to fre'
quest the localities close to human
habitations is 'peculýr to.bimself and
folowed by no other bird. He seems
almost to love the society of man.
So pretty, so small and apparently
so confiding is our little friend the
qIl that it seems almost a shame to
kill him. And so indeed it is to kill
him after the manner of the pot hunt
er. ,To take him except on the wing.
as be goes of with a soul stirring
whir on his arrowy flight across the
fields. is downright criminaL Hunting
Bob fairly and decently with dog and
gun is not murder, but an entirely dif
ferent thing-it is sport.
The first necessity for quail shooting
:s a good and well broken dog. Either
.pointer or setter will do. You may
have a 5500 Llewellia with a good
pedigree. You will do better to tie him
up and go borrow Bill Jones' sunburnt
pointer or an old lemon and white
setter which never flushes and never
mangles a bird in retrieving when you
order him in. Without the dog, and a
good, well broken one at that, there
can be no quail shooting in the sports
man's sense, but In the sharp, crisp
air of the bracing fall and winter days.
when the sun has melted the snow like
frost sad the scent Bles low and strong,
thq sportsman, with the dog and gun
he loves, can find the highest type of
sportsmanly enjoyment. On a good
seenting day and In a good quail coun
try, such as is found in this and other
sections of Virginia, the man who likes
bunting for the sake of hunting, and
not for the mere sake of killing birds.
Is sure of a good day's sport. His dog
must be fast, and. if the field is large
and open, the sport begins the moment
the dog is cast off. It is a sight to
warm a man's blood to see a well
bred, well broken dog beating out a
stubble or weed field in quest of the
game. Then suddenly there rises from
asthicket or hunch of dry leaves a bevy
of the browv, swift flying little beau
ties. Crack goes the gun, and he must
be quick and accurate of aim if he
brings them to bag. But it Is great
sport. and mowbere is It so enjoyable
as on the veldts of Virginia in these
crisp. lavigorating December days.

AUTOMATIC SERMONS.
A London Clergyman Who Has Hit
Upon a New Idea..
Almost within shadow of the Monu
ment stands the most extraordinary
church in London. This sacred edilice
is known as St. Mary-at-Hill.
Into an interior which carries one
back to long (ead ages- the oaken fa
cade and pulpit are nearly five centu
ries old-a modern, not to say sensa
tional, note has been interpolated in
the hope of solving the problem as to
how to bring back the masses to wor
ship. Tbhis hope has certainly been
gratified, for the editice at every serv
ice time resounds to the tramp of many
feet instead of being left to desolating
emptiness which characterized it for
merly.
From under that ancient pulpit the
maw of a huge brass instrument pro
jects itself, a lass drum is seen reared
against the legs of a grand piano, a tri
unial magic lantern is descrited in the
organ loft and before It stretches a
huge white sheet supported by the
fluted columns of the church.
The brass instrument under the pul
pit is called a "'monsterphone." It per
forms pieces of music for the entertain
mnent of the congregation- not necessa
rily sacred music - and it varies its pro
gramume with an occasional address
not exclusively on spiritual thenes.
For the special edifi-ation of a I)aily
Mail representative it gave a capital
rendering of Memdelssohn's "'Weddinig
March." followed by an address by the
Archbishop of Canterbnry couched in
sniple. telling language. such as his
intended hearers would understand.
The ma ic lantern in the organ loft
throws pictures on the screen stretched
across the center aisle. and when serv
Ice Is being held "Captain" It. Coleman,
sometimes with the aid of a speaking
truipet, explains the incideint depict
ed. A skilled pianist presides at the
grand piano, a numnerou, stringed or

forms pieces of music that are known
in every household, the lass drum
booms and echoes through the venera
ble pile, and the Ite'v. W. Carlile or
sonie other preacher tells his congrega
tion some plain home truths, no subtle,
theological hair splitting, no didactics,
but straight rhetorical blows from the
shoulder.
Such Is the scene that may be wit
nessed at St. Mary-at-Hill during the
dinner hour on any week day except
Saturday and every Sunday evening.
It Is the Rev. Mr. CarlIle's method of
bringing the people to church. He has
succeeded, for the congregation, num
bering once basely a dozen, Is now over
600. At midday the workmen in their
toll stained clothes spend part of their
dinner Interval listening to the "mon
sterphone" or looking at the magic lan
tern pictures, and the Sunday congre
gation Is just as homespun in its char
acter. Mr. Carlile Is satisfied with the
results of his novel effort. He Ia con
vinced be is "getting at" the right sort
of people and proudly refers to the bur

were recently left in the pe*s.-Lon

The World's Largest Grapevine.
The world's largest grapevine is lo
cated In the Carpenteria vulley, in San
ta Barbara county. It had its begin
nings in 1842, when a Spanish woman,
one Joaquina Lugod! Ayala by name,
planted a cutting of the old Mission va
riety of grape. From the start it gave
promise of an unusual future, and to
day, after balf a century of growth, it
stands the monarch of the grapevines
I of the world. The trunk measures at
the base 8 feet 4 inches to circumfer
ence. At a height of six feet from the
ground it divides into four main
branches, the largest of which has a
circumference of 3 feet 5 inches.' It
covers an area of 100 by 134 feet. Six
ty-fve stout posts with erossbeams sup
peyt its enormous spread of brapchea.
The present area. large as it may
seem, does not fully represent the pro
digious growth of the vine, for its own
er, Mr. Jacob Wilson, unwilling to con
cede it more room. cuts it back heavily
each year. In 1806 a record was kept
of the amount of grapes yielded by "Ia
vina grande" for that season. and the
astonishing total of ten tons was re
corded. During the World's fair and
again at the time of the California
Midwinter exposition large sums were
offered Mr. Wilson for the removal of
the vine for exhibition purposes, but he
wisely declined both.-California Cor.

The Gee. Will Temple.
About ten years ago the Rev. J. S.
Bitler, a Methodist minister, saw In a
vision a mighty church built for the
masses in a large city. Since that time
It has been the object of his life to
build that temple. He discovered no
means, however, with which to build
the structure until a year ago last Au
gust, when he met A. J. Wharton, a
rich mine owner of Colorado. To him
Mr. Bitler unfolded his plan, which met
with such favor in the eyes of the mine
owner that be decided to give his aid to
the work.. He presented to Bitler 100
acres of jmining land, and a telegram
the other day announced a rich strike
on the land worth $1,000,000. Mr. Bit
ler says that be will build a church in
Chicago to be called the Good WW1 tem

An Exeellent Blunder.
Blunders are always entertaining to
people who are better informed than
those who make them. A choice selec
tion brightens the pages of the report
of the board of education for 1890-1900.
It would be difficult to beat the follow
ing passage from an answer as to the
carbon dioxide present in the air: "It
you seal up In a tube a plant in one
bulb and an animal in the other. the
plant will produce the exygen neces
sary for the animal and the animal the
C02 necessary for the plant, and they
will go on living together for hundreds
of years."- London Telegraph.
A BIT OF LACE.
Napoleon Slapped Josephine's Face
Because She (at It.
For $2,000 has been sold in Paris a
piece of lace which was the cause of a
quarrel between Napoleon and .Joseph
in.. in which the cheeks of the empress
were slapped. It had been the proper
ty of Mile. l'erusset, daughter of a fa
vorite maid of the flighty empress. Na
poleon had brought the lace from Italy.
He often brought her beautiful things
on his return from a successful ca(t
paign, and Josephine never asked him
how he had got them, for she thought
that perhaps he would not care to tell.
It was a large square of the fuest old
point de venise, and Josephine as soon
as she bad it in her possession sent for
M. Duplan, her man milliner. and ask
ed him to make with it a certain tichu
and a peplum.
"Inmpossilile. your majesty." answer
ed Duplan. "The piece is too large.
and we could not arrange it graceful
ly.,.
"Well, cut it then!"
"Cut a treasure such as that! Oh,
madam, I could not do such a thing."
"Nonsense!" cried Josephine. The
lace was draped on her shoulders. She
knew how she wanted it. So she calm
ly took a pair of scissors and in a sec
ond had it set right, while long. narrow
pieces of the priceless stuff fell round
her.
At this moment the emperor entered
the room. "Cannibal!" he cried. And
he gave her a sounding slap on her vio
lently rouged cheeks, which were soon
covered with tears. Duplan discreetly
withdrew, and the lace was thrown In
to a chest of drawers. .Josephine could
not hear the sight of it after that and
at last gave it to Mme. I'erusset, her
favorite maid. The odd bits of it have
now been sold for $2,000. Another bun
dle fetched $1.000.
The passion of Josephine for lace
caused frequent scenes between her
and Napoleon. She would 'save lace,
and she sellom let anything stand in
the way of acquiring It. It is even said
that this frivolous fancy helped to
bring about her downfa!l, for Napo
leon, who at fi'-st would not hear of
forsaking her, one day said to the
Prince de Wagram: "The cup is full
now, prince. What do you think Jo
sephine did lately? 'Nobbled' one of
my young generals and made him pass
lace for her in his top boots through my
own frontier! Her soul Is made of lace,
prince, and that is too fragile a stuff
for an empress' soul!"-New York
Press.
"KING OF INVALIDS."
The Plight Which Gave That Title
to a Tomas Philadelphian.
In a small dwelling at 1218 Cabot
street, a little thoroughfare running
west of Twe'fih street just above Gi
rard avenue, lies a young nan known
throughout the length and breadth of
this broad land as the "king of Inva
lids." His throne is a bed from which
he has not moved for ten years.
As his only companions, his faith
ful nurse. Miss Carrie Dontry, and his
pet dog. Charles H. Conrad waits for
death, with the knowledge that noth
ing else can ever release imn from his
sufferings. Science can offer him no
hope, for hundreds of the most emi
neat physicians have visited his bed
side and turned away with a shake of
the head.
Rheumatoid arthritis is the name of
the strange malady with which he is
aeicted, and its effect is the formation
of bone around the joints, rendering
them extremely sensitive and perfectly
motionless. Elbows, wrists, knees and
ankles are all dislocated and abnormal
ly enlarged. while the rest of the trunk
to emaciated, and trunk and limbs are
alike contorted and twisted.
It is not ossification pure and simple.
as in this case Conrad's sufferings
would be much less. As it is. his whole
body Is so sensitive that the least
touch causes excruciating agony. His
arms are bent Inward, the left hand
slowly growing toward the stomach.
between which and it a heavy pad of
cloth is placed In an effort to change
its course.
Conrad was a strong and athletically
built young man when 21 years old,
now ten years ago. Exposure brought
on rheumatism, and this developed into
the present malady.
Through his nurse he is kept in com
munication with every chronic invalid
in the country, and by them he has
been given the title of the "king of in
vallds."-Philadelphia Times.
Paid Sunday School Teachers.
For some time the Sunday sebcoi
teachers of the Arlington Street church
of Boston have been paid, and the plan
is said to work well. The pastor, the
Rev. Paul Revere Frothingbam, says:
"Sunday school teachers are very much
better than they used to be. Teachers
today have to have some fitness for the
work. .The time is coming when It will
be considered a distinction to be allow
ed to teach. A Sunday school teacher
should be able to tell plenty of stories.
Children remember stories and so re
member what the story teaches. Sto
ries should be picturesque and should
appeal to the fancy. Jesus himself was
an Incessant story teller."
How Wales Eats.
The Prince of Wales Is very conserv
ative in the matter of eating and drink
ing. He dislikes long lists of comesti
bles, and as to beverages it is well
known to his friends that only certain
wines are acceptable to his palate. He
is also very particular as to what ci
gars he smokes. The heir apparent
likes to sit down at a fixvd hour to his
meals and. very rightly, waits for no
body. Indeed it is recorded of him
that on one occasion a relative of the
prince, a personage of high degsee, ar
rived an hour late for luncheon. His
royal highness observed: "I hope you
will like the ceffee. It is still quite
hot."
