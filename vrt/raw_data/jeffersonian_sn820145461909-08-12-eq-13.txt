Coca-Cola, a Drug Drink
By Mrs. Martha M. Allen
Some good people seem to be very
much puzzled because the Woman’s
Christian Temperance Union has for
years been opposed to the use of
Coca Cola, although it is not an in
toxicating beverage. These people
do not understand that the W. C.
T. U. is seeking to protect the chil
dren of tts own household, as well as
the public generally, from all habit
producing and injurious drugs,
whether hidden in beverages called
harmless, or used as medicines. Coca
Cola until a few years ago contained
two harmful drugs, cocaine and caf
feine, the former only in very minute
quantity. The manufacturers of this
drink always maintained that their
product did not contain cocaine, but
in a suit which the Coca Cola Com
pany brought against the United
States Government in 1902-3 for a
refund of taxes charged upon their
product as a patent medicine during
the Spanish-American war, Govern
ment chemists showed the presence
of cocaine.
Since that time chemists analyzing
Coca Cola have rarely found cocaine
in it. However, the report for 1907
of the North Dakota Pure Food Com
missioner says of the examination of
this drink, “Gave a reaction for co
caine.’’ The Coca Cola thus report
ed upon was purchased in the fall of
1906 in Atlanta, Georgia, where the
company has its headquarters. This
would seem to indicate that the com
pany’s efforts to produce a coca ex
tract without cocaine are not always
successful, for the Coca Cola manu
facturers claim that they have found
a secret process by which the flavor
only of the coca leaves will be ex
tracted. It is said upon high author
ity that this so-called coca extract is
made from the residue left in the
manufacture of cocaine.
There were a good many things it
did, and did not do, which afford no
special satisfaction to the onlooker,
and if bi-centennial sessions are de
termined upon perhaps the State
would profit to greater extent than
even through bi-ennials.

It may be asked, “Why are coca
leaves used since cocaine is no longer
desired as an ingredient of the
drink?" It is because without some
use of coca the company would lose
the right to the trade name Coca
Cola.
It is well here to explain that coca
leaves, from which cocaine is extract
ed, bear no relationship whatever to
the coca bean from which coca and
chocolate are derived. These leaves
are obtained from a Peruvian shrub
known as Erythroxylon Coca. The
fresh leaves, as used in South Ameri
ca, have an exhilarating effect for a
time, but medical writers say this is
not true of the dried leaves imported
into this country. Some people, ig
norant of the fact that cocaine is the
active principle of coca leaves, are
chewing them thinking they are
stimulating and strength-giving. All
such are in danger of addiction to co
caine, the most enslaving and de
grading drug yet known to mankind.
'rhe drug which is now the main
constituent of Coca Cola is caffeine.
Caffeine is the active principle of the
kola (also spelled cola) nut, and is
found, too, in tea and coffee. The
general sales-manager of the Coca
Cola Company told me that they get
most of their caffeine from ten. With
only the flavor of the coca leaves, and
with the caffeine taken from tea, how
does the company justify its adver
tising statement: “To the invigorat
ing properties of the coca leaf are
added the sustaining qualities of the
cola nut?”
The advertisements state that Coca
Cola is no more harmful than tea
and coffee. But every intelligent per
son knows that tea and coffee are in
jurious to children and weakly per
sons, and to any one if indulged in
immoderately. Yet children and
3effersoniart
young people not infrequently drink
five to ten and even twenty glasses a
day of Coca Cola, and some buy and
drink it by the bottle and pitcher.
Has any one ever been injured by
Coca Cola? Many travelers in the
South, anil people living in the South
ern States where this drink is much
more commonly used than in the
North, have assured me that young
people who become addicted to this
drink develop nervous disorders and
some are wrecked by it. One W. C.
T. U. woman of high standing wrote
me, “The sanitariums are full of its
victims and they are just like drunk
ards.’’ Newspaper clippings have
come to me with notices of boys go
ing insane, and the physicians in at
tendance said the trouble was caused
by cigarettes and Coca Cola. Some
W. C. T. U. women in New York
State, who have been making a study
of this drink say they see much ner
vous trouble among those who have
become addicted to it. A prominent
physician of Washington, D. C.,
writes me that he thinks Coca Cola
.even worse in its effects than beer,
which we all know to be injurious.
A health officer says, “Many factory
girls are spending most of their
wages on Coca Cola.”
Mr. Samuel Hopkins Adams, who
wrote the “Great American Fraud”
series of articles for Collier’s Week
ly, was sent to Georgia by Collier’s
to study Coca Cola. He wrote to me
of it as follows: “I reported to Col
lier’s that I am convinced that Coca
Cola does not contain cocaine. But
! I do most emphatically believe that
it produces habit, not so pronounced
indeed, as alcohol or morphine ad
diction, but, nevertheless, baneful
and difficult to break. I hear from all
parts of the South both by letter and
by personal interview of cases where
the addict must have his fifteen or
twenty glasses of ‘dope’ (the South
ern term for Coca Cola) per day. I
hope most sincerely that your organi
zation will not either explicitly or by
implication give Coca Cola ‘a clean
bill of health.’ ”
The Bureau of chemistry at Wash
ington has examined Coca Cola, and
Dr. Wiley says also: “When caffeine
is separated from tea and coffee and
used as a separate drug it exerts a
much more specific action upon the
system than when in natural combi
nation. Its general effect is to induce
that unhappy state described as ner
vousness, with deranged digestion
and impaired health.”
Dr. H. H. Rusby, dean of the Col
lege of Pharmacy of Columbia Uni
versity, New York city, a high au
thority, says: “Caffeine is a genuine
poison, both acute and chronic. Taken
in the form of a beverage it tends to
the formation of a drug habit, quite
as characteristic, though not so ef
fective, as ordinary narcotics. Per
manent disorders of the cardiac
(heart) function, and of the cerebral
(brain) circulation result from its
continued use.”
The Druggists’ Circular for May,
1908, contained a query from a drug
gist as to a good formula for a kola
nut soda syrup. The answer was in
part as follows: “There are two kinds
of druggists. One kind puts any
and every kind of stuff into stock,
and passes it out to his customers,
young and old, ignorant or learned,
foolish or wise, his only desire being
to get a profit. The other kind of
druggist refuses to stock some things
at all. Kola drinks owe their vogue
to the caffeine which they contain.
Caffeine is a poison which is cumula
tive in its effects, and an excess of
which has not infrequently caused
death. We believe you would better
be on record as discouraging rather
than encouraging the growth of the
caffeine habit, especially among
young people, who constitute a large
part of the soda-water trade.”
The London Lancet of January 25,.
1908, reports the results of experi
ments made in Paris with kola given
to horses to determine its action in
relieving fatigue. It apparently di
minished fatigue, but the horses re
ceiving it lost more weight than those
to whom it was not given. The ex
perimenter said this showed that
kola (caffeine) like alcohol, can give
the tissues a lash with a whip, but
that such energy, artificially produc
ed, was at the expense of the organ
ism. So, when people see the allur
ing advertisements of caffeine drinks
which “relieve fatigue,” let them be
ware of the relief which carries with
it injury to the body.
The sales-manager of the Coca
Cola Company told me that Coca
Cola was first sold as a patent medi
cine, but when it passed into its pres
ent ownership it was decided to sell
it as a beverage.
Will parents be wise when they
read this, and warn their children to
beware of drug drinks which enslave,
and lead to impaired digestion and
nervous breakdown? Will religious
editors read this and continue to ad
vertise Coca Cola as a harmless
drink? ***
