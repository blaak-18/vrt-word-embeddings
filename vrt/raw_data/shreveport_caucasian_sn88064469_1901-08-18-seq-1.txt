SOMETHING ABOUT
DIAMONDS
Every one interested
should know. Do you
know---every one should
know---that dealers in
Diamonds make a very
small profit on these
gems?. The man who
buys at the lowest price
can always sell at the
Ipest price, for in
ýance a dealer buys a
lot of diamonds at $100
per carat he must sell
them for a little more
than that price---if an
other dealer buys :these
same goods for $85 or
$IK) per carat he can sell
them at a profit for $100
per carat. Now this is
just what we are doing
---we are selling nice
white crystal diamonds
at $100 per carat, we
have no competition on
these goods, a call at
onr store will convince
you of this fact.

Official Proce dings of th9 Ses

City Hall, Shreveport. La.. Aug. t
(oort.-ouncil met in adjourned -
sion. Acting Mayor Hicks in ti
hair. \ý ith the following menmhbr"
present: Allen. Alston. Agars. Craw\
ford. Gtuynemer. Hughes, Jackson. Ma
Ibry and \V lgner.
The mayor read the following:
_'pon the suggestion of the secre
tary of our council. I will ask all nm mn
hers of the council and officers of the
city in addressing communications to
the mayor, or to the mayor and city
Counctl. or to any of the different corn
mitlees. or to any of the chairmen of
the different committees, to begin your
comnlunication as follows: The Mayor.
The Mayor and City Council. The
Finance Committee (or any other com
nittee), the Chairman Finance Com
mittee , or any other chairman). Leav
ing off the words. Honor, His Honor.
Honorable. Dear Sir. Sir. Gentlemen,
orany other word. And when you have
headed your communication as above.
begin at once to state your business.
and when you have finished leave oft
such words as Truly Yours Truly, Very
Truly, Your Obedient Servant, Believe
me (or us) to be ect., Very Resepect
fully, or Respectfully Submitted, and
simply sign Respectfully.
The secretary was authorized to
erase from all communications in the
future such wordt as suggested in the
above recommendation.
The fire committee was authorized to
put in proper condition the house of H
Herold that was knocked out of pluml
by the falling of the old engine hous
on Travis street.
The contract of Busby & Arthur wat
presented and read and on motion o:
Mr. Guynemer was accepted and th
mayor authorized to sign same. witl
the amendment that the contractors an
to pay for the party wall owned by Dr
John Comegys. Adopted.
Shre*port. La., Aug. To, Igot.-The
Mayor-sed City Council: Pursuant t'
our" agreement with you under date o
May 2. we prepared plans and specifi
cations for what is known as the Allen
dale and Texarkana Annex sewers anm
advertised same to be let at public bid
ding under date of August 2. The en
closed advertisement was inserted it
two issues of the Engiineering News o:
New York. two issues of the Engineer
ing and Building Record of New York
six issues of the New Orleans Picayun
and six issues of the Shreveport Timet
and Journal. On the day set for the
opening of the bids, August 2, not one
was received, and looking about for
reason we discovered that Sherman
Tex.. had advertised what seemed to b.
a much larger contract to he let on the
5th. and as there was not time betweer
the 2d and 5th for contractors to figur,
up a job of this magnitude, we con
clud'd that the bidders that might have
been here had gone to Sherman and
on this supposition sent a represenTa.
tive to Sherman to invite the unsuc
cessful bidders to return to Shreve
port to a letting on the ninth, and the
result was that we received three bids
as follows:
Guild & Co., Chattanooga $97,26o.
T. J. Shea, St. Louis, $98,950o.
C. M. Burkhalter & Co., Birming
ham. $ro5.725.6o.
Detail of the lowest bid as received
is enclosed herewith.
Going back to the subject of our es
timate an dthe ordinance ,which budg
eted the interest on these sewers, you
will find that our estimate on the Allen
dale sewer as originally laid out with
the outlet along Cross bayou was
$55,o0oo. Our estimate on the Texarkana
Annex sewer was $16,ooo, or a total of
$71.ooo. Since that time it was found
impossible to utilize the steep bank of
the bayou on account of its at present
being occupied by the Shreveport and
Red River Valley railroad and we were
forced to lay out a new route along the
alley between Cypress and Caddo
streets, which in our opinion would in
crease the icost $16,ooo, or making a to
tal estimate of $87.oo0o. which included
the to per cent for engineering; this
estimate was based upon the data we
had kept from the costs of previous con
structions done by us and of course in
cluded no contractor's profits. We had,'
however, believed that a contractor
with a well equipped plant could reduce
our cost sufficient to do the work at
the same price and still leave a fairi
profit, which from the bids submittedI
seem sto have been an erroneous con
clusion.
While Guild & Co's bid would indi
cate thatit is for all of the work or
none, yet Mr. Guild just before leaving!
the city indicated his willingness to put
in the Texarkana Annex sewer only at
the price bid, which you will note on
the profile or grade on which we esti
mated $16,aoo is $18,g95.
As you will see, it remains for you
to determine whether or not this con
tract shall be awarded on the bids re
ed oulr - anlte Ilia tc 1t, -ta . ite t
if the contract is anlardýt la ýupl mpuiI t
tary" ordinance tnnt.t hi p--a. d l :tl t

:ionalt aimount to cover exCtalIttn
Iplht the to per cent for engineering.
wih:ch we he>lievc would make a total 4f
lapproximating $t1o.ooo. or render it
accessary for you to budget the ; per
cent on $39,oo000 additional.
Analyzing in a messure Guild & C,'"
bid. if you will subtract frlotl the totatl
the hid on the Texarkana .\nnex. .r
section six. vou will note that he hide
for the Allendale sewer $78.30;: and
subtract from this hid on section five.
which are only the lateral: in the A1
lendale district. vou v 11 find that the
colst of a trunk line from Red river to
the Texas plank road by the route laid
out by us and adopted by you. is
$73,0,o. which does not includee the to
'ier cent for engineering, but you can
further estimitee with a certainty that
the cost of future sewers on this side
if town will not exceed $I per foot.
since this trunk line follows the lowest
,art of the valleys, and future sewers
can be laid in light cuts and be given
good grades.
We are holding Guild & Co's check
twaiting your decision and advice as to
-ur further action in this matter. Yours
truly,
SHIREVEPORT V\ATERWORKS Co.

Shreveport, La.. Aug. 15. Igo1.-To
the Mayor and Council: Your city en
gineer submits hereto attached a sketch
or plan on 1-8 inch to the foot showing
the proposed outlet and inlet to the
sewer connection under Louisiana
street, also approximate cost of the
same. The total cost of each connec
tion is as follows: 7.2oo brick at $16 per
I,ooo, in wall $152.20: 5 cubic yards of
cement at $8 per yard $4o: total cost of
the above work as per sketch attached
$192.20.
I therefore recommend that the city
furnish the brick for this work and let
ting the balance by contract. I also cal!
your attention to the matter of sub
drainage on Sprague street. Jordan
street, Plank Road and Commerce
street. I would earnestly recommend
that the city or improvement commit
tee be empowered to negotiate for the
purchase of five or six carloads of vit
rified tiled drain to be used throughout
the construction of our new work, rang
ing from 18 to 36 inches in diameter, as
it would be impossible for us to make
any permanent improvemertc in refer
ence to sub-drainage, especially under
ground, unless it is done with the above
material.
I earnestly hope that this report will
meet with y ulr hearty approva' and im
mediate action. Respectfully.
FRANK \V. K..xE.
City Engineer.
