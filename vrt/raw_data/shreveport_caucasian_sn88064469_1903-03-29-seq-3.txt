Luxor. Egypt, March 10.--"Nile Notes
of a Howadji." No doubt you read
this rare and radiant work of George
William Curtis when you were young,
or, if you are still young and have not
read it, do so now. You breathe in
with it the true atmosphere of the Nile,
and once thus filling you this will
henceforth be a part of you. If you
yourself visit the Nile. you will know
its fascination before you set sail up
on its enchanted waters; if you never
visit it, you will know its enchantment
nevertheless in a degree.
Still the lateen and triangular sailed

hires a steam dahabeah or launch at
or near Cairo and makes of it a genuine
houseboat for himself and friends while
he is doing the Nile. A party of a few
friends may club together and hire a
vessel of this kind for not great ex
pense. The dahabeab is a sort of
house barge, with a kitchen in the bow
and a raised cabin aft, containing
sleeping roonjs, saloon and promenade

tiwning, under whiclr passengers may
sit and watch the Nile country as they
glide onward and upward or downward,

history and encyclopedia. Modern
4gypt as pictured on the Nile today is
greatly more interesting to anybody
except an antiquarian than the Egypt
of the pyramids and tumbledown tem
ples. There is the strange mixture of
past and present that makes the whole
seem unreal, a phantasmagoria of
which the new view comes on the
scene before the former one has disap
peared. The universal Yankee, son of
the newest great nation on the globe,
wakes the echo banks of the old Nile

wife-he In the latest British, ,phe in
the latest Paris clothes-sit under a
machine woven canvas awning and
look out upon the banks of the great
river where camel caravans come down
for water precisely as they did 5,000
years ago. Still the Arab men have
their heads swathed in big white tur
ba.si, asti the women are swathed all
over and veiled in black, the most per
spiration producing, torturing hue that
can be Worn in a tropical country.
Their men keep the women mmhmied
in the uncomfortable black probably
because it serves them right for having
had the presumption to be born fe
males.
It is surprising how the women can

move down to the river's edge with
earthen water jars upon their heads
and fill and carry these away without
spilling a drop. A white woman would

water buffaloes down the Nile bank to

Are sisters under the skin.
The oxlike buffalo proceeds clumsily
into the water and lies down. That is
his way of taking a bath. Nothing but
his nose is visible above the surface.
His brown skinned, black draped mis
tress orders him to come out. He does
not budge. The woman shouts vocifer
eusly. Still he pays no attention. It
is necessary to his health that he shall
be thoroughly cooled off in this glorious
Nile current. Yet more fearsomely
shrieks the black robed Egyptian wife.
She calls on all the old time divinities,
the cat headed goddess. the dog beaded
rod and the okapi headed one, to curse
that obdurate brute, but the obdurate
brute is not moved a hair's breadth.
The woman cannot well wade in after
him. Her drapery is too voluminous
for that. She can only wait till the
water buffalo gets a good ready. Then
he grunts and comes deliberately out,
lumbering up the steep banks, all un
heeding the feminine blows that are
rained upon his flanks.
To the steainer landings come laden
camel caravans, with great bales of
goods and baskets of figs and dried
fruits. TJaat, too, the camel caravans
have been doing 4,000 or 5,000 years,
only in the ancient times there were no
Nile steamboats or Egyptian railways.
A camel is not at all the patient, gentle
creature you learned of in your school
books. On the contrary, though per
haps generations of bad treatment
have made it so, it is stupid, stubborn
and perpetually complaining aloud.
When a camel is made to lie down to
be loaded, it groans and rages audibly,
as if it were about to be- killed. When
it is made to lie down again to be un
loaded, it makes the same whining,
groaning, scolding, protesting noise, as
though nothing was right with it any
how and whatever way it was treated
it was imposed upon. It is always kick
ing mentally, always making known
that it is abused and imposed on, yet
always putting up with things as they
are. The camel is like some women
one meets-always complaining of in
justice, but always submitting to it.
In the caravans the pack camels are
marched in a string. A rope or strap
around the nose of one is fastened to
the animal ahead of him, in turn an
other is fastened to this one, and so they
move onward. A camel in the act of
lying down is perhaps the awkwardest
animal in creation. A writer describ
ing the process says: "Creakingly, with
many unoiled joints, the camel col
lapses in sections; grumbling, he rises
again and allows himself to be led by
the nose by the smallest child."
Other things than cnmels groan and
creak perpetually as they work on the
Nile banks. These are the rude pump
ing wheels. Sometimes in the early
lightr their complaining is the only
sound that vibrates above the silence.
There are two kinds of pumping ma
chines, itf contrivances so rough can
be called macbines. The larger kind is
called a "saggler." It is a wheel with
a chain of earthen pots attached, and
the lever that turns the wheel is work
ed by o~ or buiffalo power, like the one
it the illustration. The other variety
of water raising apparatus has a chain
of leather buckets attached, and it is
operated by mere man power. A boy
may larrup the oxen around their path
at the saggier machine; two or three
men must sweat and bend to the work-.
ing of the other, called a "shbadouf."
Some of the Egyptian natives are
brown skinned, the brown occasionally
merging into almost black. Other na
tives are copper colored, like Ameriean
Indians, giving plausibility to the the
ory that Egypt, the most ancient, was
settled from America. That at least is
the newest theory of science. The na
tives, men and boys, go often more than
half naked about their work, their
skins shining like burnished bronse or
copper, You see sometimes on shore a
slim, graceaul brown boy wholly naked
except for a girdle and a crown of

he makes, like a child Bacchus. Some
times the naked boy with the burnish
ed bronze skin would make for himself
a skiff to row upon the waters. Easily
done. He gathers a large bundle of the
branches or stalks of the darra tree.
The dagra, spelled also darro, is the
Egyptian sycamore. The boy ties the
sticks firmly together, so they cannot
float apart, shoves the bunch out into
the water and mounts and sits astride
it, .his bare legs hanging down in the
water on each side. Then, with a
spadelike paddle, he rows himself
boldly upon the great river and propels
himself safe across.

You have just got within the vesti

He apologizes, but the coin you have
given him is bad. You look at it. Yes,
it is bad. It is nothing but a bit of

You are pretty certain in your mind
that it isn't the coin you gave the man

lImilarity on Animals and Men.
It has been observed that if the
tamed dog is taken back to the wild
state he loses his voice. These "sound
ing voices" are produced in the animal
throat in a way similar to human lan
guage, but are not "voices" proper nor
"languages" proper, and yet they are
full of psychological expression and re
veal the animal's psychic states. If we
tickle a chimpanzee in the armpit, the
touch produces a grin on the face simi
lar to that of a man under like circum
stances. He also emits laughterlike
sounds. The hame is the case with the
ourang outang. The gorilla knits the
brow when angry, Just like men.
We often observe in apes a complete
change in the facial muscles when
something is going to happen, be it
agreeable or disagreeable. It is so also
with the child. In apes there is evi
dently the same connection between
the facial muscles and vocal muscles as
in man.
Character Building.
Character is the wool of honor from
which a coat of mail can be woven that
the swiftest arrow of shame or the
keenest knife of disrepute cannot
pierce. Every thought that enters our
mind, every act we do and every word
we utter adds a link to the golden
chain of character. The strength of a
steam engine can be estimated to with
in an ounce of its limit, but it is im
possible to estimate the force of a no
ble character. The hardest hearts are
softened and the most repulsive dispo
sitions become fascinating. Our fail
ures and our successes help to form a
reputation that may be destroyed by
an external force, but the destruction
of a character can only be effected by
some internal force.-Our Boys' Maga
zine.
Her Reason.
Dr. Porter had responded to a note
left at his door by a farmer asking
him to go as soon as possible to see his
little boy, who had "a very bad cold."
The doctor took one-look at the child
and turned to the mother.
"Don't you know your boy iscoming
down with measles?" he asked se
verely.
'tYes, doctor. I knew he was," said
the woman.
'"Then what in the world, did you
mean by writing me he had 'a very bad.
cold? " asked the doctor.
The woman hesitated for a moment;
then, looking at her husband, she said,
with sullen frankness, "Neither him
nor me knew how to spell measles."

character of "The Seditious Man,"

"I see your honor shakes his head at

"I have not intimated." replied the

"That may be true," the court re

I reserved the right to remove it in any
manner I saw fit. Proceed with your

Caleb Cashing's Dress.
Caleb Cushing's peculiar manner of
dress and his eccentricities were fre
quently the subject of newspaper arti
les. Although quite a large and port
ly man, his clothes always seemed to
be two or three sizes too large for him
and of the cheapest material. He al
ways during both summer and winter
wore a large cloth cap pulled close
down on his head and altogether look
ed anything but the brilliant jurist
and diplomat. One day, after reading
an unusually caustit comment upon his
dress, he remarked to the writer, "I
guess by the time that fool is as old as
I am he will care more for comfort
than fashion."
Sees on an Ostrlih Farm.
It is no uncommon thing to see a
male ostrich strutting about followed
by three or four distinct broods, all of
different sizes. When the incubating
process is completed, the cock bird
leads his young ones off and if he
meets another proud papa engages in
a terrific combat with him. The van
quished bird retires without a single
chick, while the other, surrounded by
the two broods, walks away trium
phantly.
Gave Himself Away.
After preaching on the occasion of
the reopening of a restored church the
bishop thanked the churchwarden, an
old farmer, for his a.are in the good
work. "And I must thank your lord
ship for your sermon." was the reply,
"but I could not help thinking, as you
talked about sin, that your lordship
must have been a little wildish your
self when you were a young man."
Contentment.
One who had tried several times to
jump across a stream and had repeat

he said to a friend, "How much better
I am than you in having accomplished
