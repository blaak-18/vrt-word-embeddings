securing them. The p.o le can ld vill
get what they ivant in a government like
ours when they hive the cotraie of
their convictions. Politicians dare n, "t
stand in the way of public sentiment
when it is aroused and ready to assert
and enforce its power. If the people of
Louisiana really want nominat ons by
primaries and all officers made elective
by a popular vote, they will have it so
or know the reason why. We believe
the people. want these reforms, but we
shall see.-Homer Guardian.
The people know what they want, but
being law-abiding, conservative and pa
tient, are slow in manifesting their dis
pleasure beyond complaint or silent pro
tests. When the people will, they will,
and from all indications they are awak
ening: rubbing their eyes and thinking.
When they get on their feet and begin
to move, silently, earnestly, determined
ly, they will secure what they want and
should have. In the meantime the press
of the State, the press that would help
the people in the awakening, will con
tinue to direct and point the way to
emancipation, to political freedom.
GORýAN AND FOSTER.
Senator Murphy J. Focter of Louis
iana was ambitious to become a member
of the Senate steering committee; but
Gorman had the naming of the commit
tee, and he passed the Louisiana senator
by. Murphy J. is a great politician in
Louisiana and usually has things his
own way, but when he goes up against
Arthur Pue Gorman he meets a man
who knows a thing or two about the
festive game of politics himself, and he
may expect to lose out, at least, occa
sionally.- -Homer Guardian.
Yes, that't all right, but nex' time Mr.
Gorman he will know something when
he go up agajvsst Mr. Frosty; and, when
Mr. German he wakes ' up my friend
fromtSaistte Marie he will find put that
Mr. Frost is a goid craisf ,s eater, and
he .ikes the "hisque," the crabs, the
g t alo.Ale and the shriithp and all the
nice things fixed xp in the fine Creole
style, with hot pepper and garlic and
.enion in them all. Mr. Gorabn what he
know, Ch? He eat the terrapin with the
taste of mud! He think because he is
from Maryland and was "a gold bug"
he ras, so smart, hat he can never be so
"slick" as Murphie J. ,When he was sit
ting with Etzpatridc and them othelr
fellows in New Orleans . fixing tlei
idle triggers. Gormfn he think he was
one great big man but in Louisiana,
akotig de of Murphie J. Frosty, he was
like one little pfaitl sonkee.
The $apoleoinville Pioneer, for: some
unaccountable reason, is of the opinion
that Justice F. T. Nicholls will be the
next Demnoeratic candidate for governor
of this State; and with wonderful con
etgacythe cletir headed editor of the
asfeld Journal says that "twhile he
does not oncur. with the Pioneer, still
there is not a man in the State whom
lie would rather vote for than Francis

THE FLOOD OF 1849.
Mr. Enny Wells of Bayou Robert.
one of the oldest native born citizens of
the parish, called today to renew his
subscription. He remembers perfectly
the immense flood of 1849 in the Red
river valley. He says that in 1849 all of
Alexandria was overflowed except a
few spots here and there. The land
above Alexandria, known as the
"sland," all the way from here to Boyce.
was overflowed with but few exceptions.
The water ran over the island into
Bayou Boeuf, and through Bayou Rob
ert. A' that time there was a ferry on
Bayou Rapides where Bayou Robert
united with Bayou Rapides. During the
overflow of 1849 the water was almost
a solid sheet frmo the pine hills on the
north side of the river to the pine hills
on the south side, ten miles or more
wide. the levees in 1849 did not amount
to much. -Alexandria Town Talk.
In 1849 when "levees" was mentioned
it was more in the line of raising "the
pot" than of restraining the flood of the
river. An old 49'er once said within the
hearing of the Caucasian Grinder:
"Well, sir, in '49 there was a flood which
was a flood. It beat Noah's forty days
rain. Shreveport was then :a smaller
place than it is now-(this conversation
is recalled as a reminiscence of the flood
of -). "Well, sir, talk about rain
and water and more water than whiskey
and all this nonsense! Well.. sir, there
was so much water in the country, at
the time, that a man drunk as a 'biled
[uil' would sober up as straight as a
judge st he sight of old Red booming
down t the Gulf. Everything' was wa
ter; even whiskey straight had a water
tac abbit't it, and to give tone to his
whiskey even a man of temperate hab
its had to mniL irs a. little red hot Cay
enne pepjer with it. Several generally
sober-sided tried to 'full up' and raise
the tomw but-. It was not possible
for ra mah to keep up a 'jamboree' on
account of the water. The water cov
ered every inch of land from the hills
in .Bossier artd Arkansas to the hills in
Texas and Caddo parish. Where is now )
Duck lake and Silver lake and Market
street steamboats and alligators could
Boat at ease. You may all talk about
water and rain, but there never was
such water as in '49."
And the man who said all this was
seemingly astonished, somewhat dum
founded, because not a man in the
crowd ventured to question a single
word of his statement. Every word he
spoke, especially his reference to the
man being "tanked up" "sobering up"
at the very sight 6f Red river, were' ac
cepted without reservation. The 49'er is
always all right. It is hot the flood of
'49 which is worrying the people, nor
the whiskey, but the water of 1903.
And in this connection, this asserva
tion is oflered without fear or apprehen
sion of .successful refutation or contra
diction but in no sense of transcending
the speculative inadvertency of the
'49'er as 'to water and whiskey, and that
assertion is that at this time there is
more water than whiskey in the country
lnd that sotse men will become "tanked
up" and "full up" all water to the con
trary notwithstanding. Now, Mr. 49'er,
disprove this!
RIED RIVER VALLEY.
The Coushatta Citizen says: "The Val
ley road has let the contract for the
construction of its extension as- far as
Baton Rouge. They will not bridge the
Mississippi, but will transfer their trains
from Water Valley at the head of the
Atehafajaya riiver, by means of a ferr

HELD UP BY BANDITS

SIX OF THEM KILLED.
Drives of :ie Sta e Al-io Met an Aw"
Sful F it t and Not a Soul Is Left
to T1l the Trauiie Tale of
hle:I and Pudr
Angeles, C V Ir(M h 11.-A dis
pat: 7froi Tucsoni. Ariz., to the Her
ald savy thit Mexican bandits held up
the stage which runs between Potam
and Torin on the Yaqui river, in So
nora, last Tuesday night, killing all
six passengers. Among there were
Filiberta Alvarado, a wealthy Mexican,
who owned a number of ranches along
the Yaqui river. The authorities at
Guaymas were at once notified. Alva
rado and his wife had taken the stage
from Potam to Torin, and the men no
doubt thought they carried a large sum
of money with them. The stage car
ried very little mail and scarcely any
money or valuables. The holdup
took place about half way between the
two towns. Just how thestage was at
tacked will never be known, as all pas
sengers and the driver were killed.
They were picked up the same after
noon of the tragedy, and the circum
stances give evidence that they put up
a fight, else they would not have been
killed. Their bodies were rifled of
everything of value on them. The
traces had been cut and the horses
had been allowed to run wild. The
cover and body of the stage were shot
full of holes.
It is thought by the Guaymas au
thor; ies that the perpetrators were
some bandits who had taken refuge in
the mountains back of the Yaqui river
and were watching for Alvarado.
Friends of the murdered ranchman say
he had little money with him at the
time. Alvarado had been married only
two months.
With him were Senorita Julia Beredo
and Senorita C. H. de Gonzales, both
of prominent families of that country,
and both of whom were murdered.
