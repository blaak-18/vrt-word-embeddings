Said the Preacher: “The Women Are
Strangers to Us!”
One of the New York papers car
ries this item:
“WARDLAW SISTERS NOT AIDED
BY CONFERENCE.
Methodist Clergy at Newark Decide
They Can Do Nothing.
New York, April 7.—The Meth
odist Conference in Newark, N. J.,
decided yesterday that it could do
nothing for the Wardlaw sisters, Mrs.
Caroline B. Martin, Mrs. Mary W.
Snead and Miss Virginia Wardlaw,
awaiting trial in that city on the
charge of having murdered their
kinswoman, Mrs. Ocey W. M. Snead.
The old women appealed separate
ly to the Conference by letter, im
ploring aid and directing attention
to the fact that they are the daugh
ters of a Methodist clergyman, John
B. Wardlaw.
“The women are strangers to us,”
said Rev. Dr. Jesse L. Hurlburt,
speaking for Bishop Anderson. “We
can not help them, for it would be
necessary for us to constitute our
selves into a court of justice to do so.
The dignitaries of the church men
tioned in their letter are of the Meth
odist church, South, which is a separ
ate denomination from the the Meth
odist Episcopal church, and therefore
have no official connection with this
conference.”
The letters of the three women
were identical, declaring that they
are held prisoners “under a gigantic
mistake.”
The clipping was sent to me by
some one signing his name “Little
Tom.”
Little Tom made sarcastic refer
ence to the fact, that the poor old
women were not natives of China.
Wasn’t that a cold-blooded re
mark—“ The women are strangers to
us?”
And it would be safe to bet that
the Rev. Dr. Jesse L. Hurlburt is
subject to severe, intermittent ab
dominal turmoil, concerning “the
lost” of heathendom.?
The three women in question are
old and poor and ‘friendless. They
are accused of an unnatural crime.
They are presumed to be innocent
until proven auilty. They are in
prison, and are pleading for help.
BUT. “THEY ARE STRANGERS TO
US.”
And if I were a sport, I’d stake
both the Jeffs against the Union City
Percheron, that the Reverend Doctor
Jesse L. Hurlburt is visited regularly
by distressing grips and gripes about
the Koreans, the Chinks, and the
Japs.
“Strangers to US!”
“STRANGERS to us!”
Same race, same color, same creed,
same tongue, same nation, same lo
cality—consequently, uninteresting.
Nothing to cause an elegant $2
per plate banquet!
Nothing to call for a mass-meeting.
Nothing to excuse a spectacular bit
of stage-play. Nothing to ride into
public notice on. Nothing to cause
a salary to come in sight. Nothing
to excuse the appointment of an
other “Board”; and a few more
secretaries, stenographers and clerks.
N®: just an ordinary occurrence,
relating to c®mm®nplace old women,
whose s®uls may go to —, so far as
the Rev. Dr. Hurlburt is cpncerned.
He, and the like of him, feel mar
vellously concerned lest the alleged
heathen be “lost”; but of and con
cerning the 60,000,000 Americans,
who don’t even pretend to be Christ
ians, the attitude of the Hurlburts
‘amounts to saying:
“You can go to h —ll, if you’ve a
mind to: it’s not our business to save
you. Our business is to win “Africa
for Christ”; discipleize Korea;
transform Buddhists into Christians,
and save China.
Oh, yes: we are a unit on that.
Say “China”, to the helpless prison
ers in the synagogue, and even the
Tight-wads turn to India-rubber. The
man who won’t pay his grocery-bill
will cough up coin for China, every
pop. But you let some poor little
orphan children, or destitute old man
or woman, in this country, appeal for
a lift: it’s like churning butter to
get any coin for them.
Last year, the papers were saying
that a lineal descendant of John
Wesley, a destitute and desolate old
woman, was about to starve in Eng
land.
I expected to hear the religious
press resound with the case, and with
appeals for charitable contributions.
Something may have been done to
provide for Wesley’s grand-niece;
but, if so, it escaped my attention.
“The women are strangers to us.”
They are the daughters of a Meth
odist preacher, and they appealed di
rectly to a Methodist Conference:
but their prayer for assistance, at
this awful crisis in their poor old
lives, was almost contemptuously
spurned.
But how can we buy up “Our Dear
little Dora”, all over Africa, if we
give aid, in this country, to all who
need it?
How can we maintain our free
drug stores, hospitals, orphanages,
industrial farms, etc., in Japan, Ko
rea, India and China, if we go to
doing similar work among the needy
and the non-Christian of our own
land?
How can we supply the best of doc
tors, surgeons, trained nurses, and
experts to teach agriculture, me
chanical arts, and physical culture to
the heathen, if we go to doing the
same thing for our own people?
How can we furnish gold leaf, to
plug rotting teeth; and music
teachers to teach Japanese girls to
bang the piano, if we go to sending
out missionary dentists, music
teachers, etc., over here?
How in the world can we put up
the coin which enables the mission
ary to keep “at least three servants,”
in his luxurious home, if we go to
helping friendless old paupers in
America?
We just can’t do it, Brethren!
We just can’t do it!
We have our “marching orders”.
We have no discretion in the matter.
And the word “go” and the word
“preach” undeniably mean other
things, in manner and form follow
ing:
Teachers, of literature, mathe
matics, music, farming, blacksmith
ing, carpentering, mechanics, sur
gery, medical science, sewing, cook
ing, hygeine, and any other vener-
Jeffersonian
able thing that will be good for the
heathen.
Physicians, male and female, who
will travel about healing the sick.
Surgeons, who will either take a
“station”, or meander around look
ing up folks who need operations per
formed.
Trained Nurses, who industriously
nose around and gad about, the
whole Catholic and heathen world, to
wait on the afflicted.
Architects, who are kept “in the
field,” designing beautiful and mag
nificent school-houses, colleges,
Churches, Missionary residences,
Asylums, Orphanages, Gymnasiums,
Hospitals, and Dispensaries.
Carpenters, kept constantly at
work, building these costly struc
tures- in heathen lands.
House-boats, for the missionaries
to travel in.
Medical Supplies, of all kinds, and
the latest and best, dispensed freely
in the hope that the pills and the
capsules will win souls for Christ.
Cash, wherewith to “redeem”
black orphans, “all over Africa.”
Salaries, for the Home Board, ditto
for the Foreign Board, ditto the pub
lishing house which prints the stuff
that does the business; ditto for the
missionary papers and magazines
whose purpose in the life, here be
low, is to train every missionary
mouth to naturally express the word,
“More!”
Again, Salaries, for the Mission
aries, and their wives, with an al
lowance for children which must
have a natural tendency to rivet the
missionary mind on the Scriptural in
junction to “multiply and replenish.”
And, once more,Salaries, for the
teachers, and doctors, and surgeons,
and nurses, and attendants, and as
sistants.
And —once again, my hearties!
Salaries, for Experts who teach
farming, ditto for those who teach
mechanics, and same for they who
tutor the heathen hand and mind in
the gentle art of shoeing a horse!

THE JEFFERSONIANS, Thomson, Ga.
Bear with me, yet awhile, Breth
ren, while I mention that there is the
Salary, for the noble souls who
teach the benighted heathen how the
American carpenter uses his tools.
By initiating Chinks, Japs, Hindoos
and Africans into the mysteries of
jack-plane, brace and bits, turning
lathe, et cetera, it appears that we
win their souls for Christ.
Please excuse me, I must use that
word again
SALARY, for the natives who are
hired at so much per, to enter the
field for the conversion of their own
kith and kin.
As I’ve already used the word
“Salary”, so often, I will not refer to
the engineers and crews who man
the house-boats and naptha-launches.
Oh, it is a lovely system. And the
local preacher, in this country, is
just as much the pack-horse of it, as
are the haggard congregations whom
he is compelled, often, to harass for
More Money.
How long will it take the local
ministry to begin to understand
