IN MEMO11 IAM.
On Frida;i the 8th inst., 2 o clock A. M
departed this life, C. EMIt.E SOMP.AYRAC,
aged 14 years aid 5 months, an ohl and
honoi ed citizen of this parish.
Unlike many, whose excellencies of
heart and character, receivio their gloss
from the wrangling tongues of the gos
sipping world his, with no words to her
ald their Ieauty, or proclaim his wealth
of heart. found a solemn and sanctified
cxlpression, in the magnificence of his
charitable acts Like a distant ship at
sea, t less se, tiless scet the heavier and richer
she is laden. A man of excellent busi
ness tact, a first class planter, punctual,
faithful, and exact in the fultilment of
every business engagement, his name
stands amongst the first on the honored
list of this parish.
Possessed of sufficient mecans, and cast
ing aside the seltish motives, which al
most invariably control those similary
situated, he took under his paternal roof
and care the children of imistoirtune, faith
erless, and mnotlerless; rescued them from
the smtres of a cold and uncharitableh
world, and as they entered his heart and
home, blessed and called them his own.
After nmtn, nurni, years of intense suftr
ing he ended his mortal career within the
midst of his dutiful nurses ofCote Joveuse
and Ilrevelle Island.
We kneel to-day beside thy grave and
call the friend, benefactor, Fr TI nER. The
tear of gratitude will ever moisten thy
seplchre, and the flowers of memory will
eer lm ver Iloom over thee.
A SON, AND A DAUGHTER.

That Terrible Scourge,
Fever and agne, and its congener, billions
remittant, besides affections of the stom
ach. liver and bowels, produced by mias
matie air and water, are both eradicated
.tld prevented by the use of Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters, a purely vegetable elix
ir, indorsed by physicians, and more ex
tensively used as a remedy for the ablove
class of disorders, as well as for many
others, than any medicine of the age. A
languid circulation, a torpid state of the
liver, a want of vital stamina, are condi
tions peculiarly favorable to malarial dis
eases. They are, however, surely reme
died by the great Preventive, which, by
invigorating the system and endowing it
with regularity as well as vigor, provides
it with a resistant power which enables
it to withstand disorders not only of a
inala'ial type, but a host of of others to
which feeble and ill regulated systems
are subject. The Bitters are a safe as
well as searching eradicant, and have
widely superseded that dangerous drug
qulinine, which palliates but does not
eradicate malaria. March 2.5t.
The Detroit Free Press is publish
ing many interesting articles refer
ring to incidents and actions during
the late war ; and is also doing much
to aid the South inducing immigra
tion by the publication of correspon
deuce and articles relating to our ad
vantages, soil and climate. The
Free.Press we regard as one of the
very best family pa:pers published and
it should be cordially sustained by
the South.
The little captive girl told a mighty
man of war, who was suffering from
leprosy, to bathe three times in a riv
er to be clean, and be did and was
clean, so we say use Home Stomach
Bitters and be healed of all liver dis
orders.

It is llly opinion that were the engines

she hatd all the spale on the river ont

After the Ilope had been st huk and was

There was no other vessels outside of the

Nothing that has occurred in this
is to be omlaredb in point of real
value and importance to the peopll,
with thel passage by tihe Legislature
ft the hill granting State aid to the
,New Orleais and Pacific Railway.
This action secures the early com
pletil, of the road, which will place
us in con iunitatiot with Shreveport
aild Marshal, Texas. It is a small
estimate to say that New Orleans will
receivet an adihitilt of 500,000 hales of
cotlt)n, whiilst there is no calculating
the qlantity of grain, cattle and other
producI ts of Noith Louisiana and Tex
as, that now findl their way to St.
Louis anld Mlemphis, which will be
certain to seek this port.
Besides this, the buiiling and ope
rationi of the road will give hundreds
Sof our idle people eiployment; it
will gtve business and life to work
shops, macehinists, fonu dries and oth
er indu stris; it will open up to set
tleeent and cultivation some of the
most valuahle lands in the State;
itt fine, it will add vigor attd spirit to
ievery interest, and make Lonisiana
something of the State it should hbe.
\Ve deemtt it duel to these Senatrs
whlto voted for this bill to put their
Snames on record, so that in lthe future
it will be known who were the wise
statesImen aind progressive legislators
who vnled fur the greatest enterprise
ever conceived for the general welfare
of otur State.
The vote was as follows:

Special to Agents and Advertisers.
The VI~JoICtror has by hard work
built up the leading circulation of the
country papers of this State, in facts
circulation far above the average.
That circulation is constantly on the
increase and demands the fullest rates
from advertisers.
Hereafter and for all times, no ad-.
vertisements trill be taken for less than
our published rates. Every adver
tisement in our columns is a paying
one and that too in cash. It is use
less, therefore, for advertisers or
agents to address us for other rates,
or to send advertisements to be in
serted for less than our card. They
will not meet aftention. No cut occu
pying more than two square will be
inserted at all.
We dont want to hby any thing in
the shape of pianos, organs, blacking,
starch, sewing machines, and such
like and piay therefor in advertising
and so none of that class of adverti
sets need apply.
All advertisements payable quar
terly in advance.
These are our rules-they are as
awful atid as imperitive as fate, and we
will have them observed or fill every
colomn of the VINDICATOR with red
hot editorials and other choice read
ing matter.

W'e have heretofore favored giving
conservative and ecnomical fmeas
tires a fair trial. and what is the re- "
sutilt ? Many months of valuable time
has been wagsted trying to patch up 1
thie ld cionstitutioji Iecanse it w:1.

Again we say, don't count the cost
too closely. for the evils under which
Louisiaina is now suffering, is like a

The Modern Seven Ages of Man,

All thlie world's a stage, and all the

ani his coat-tail pockets filled with
colnfetionery; then a soldier, f ,ll of
strange oaths and hugs, jealous in
honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
seeking the bubble reputation even
in the cannon's month at $13 a month
and fountl; and then the ahhderman
with a bay window on his stomach,
full of wise sausage and other things
to eat, who charges $2 for marrying a
man and kisses the bride without
leave or license. The sixth age slips
into the lean pantaloons, with or
without ruffles, as the case may be;
last sceno of all that ends this strange
eventful history is second childishness
and mere oblivion, sans teeth, sans
taste, sans everything except the fac
ulty of lying about the hot summers
and cold winters of his younger days.
Rather Cutting.
[Teche Courier.]
We are astonished to see that tile
representatives in both branches of
the General Assembly from the parish
of Orleans, have this far dictated to
the representatives for the country
parishes what shall or shall not be
idoie in matters mter lrially affecting
the interest of the country parishes.
It is well kniown, that for the past
thirty years tile politics of this State
has been coutrolled, and mianaged by
a few political bUnllllnmers, who gene
rally reside at the capital, and who
have no interest in common witlh theil
people. It is equally well known
that these politicianis generally control
the average law-nmaker, anridtl shape
legislation in accordance with their
ideas of polities, and we are free to
admit that the indications are ill fa
vor of the presnltnition tlhat the pro
posted ameudnenltts were conceived
by a set of political bunimers, in their
own interest, to be used its a hug
bear to carry the next election. The
peoplle should and will examine for
themselves, antid vote for those amend
ments, or tinot, just as thei'r consciences
dictate, and the politicians located at
tile capital will find that they don't
amount to much after all.
