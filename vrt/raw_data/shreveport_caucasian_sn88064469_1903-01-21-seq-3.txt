APPiEAL TO SQUIERS.
The Protesters Assert New Republic
Is Levying Oppressive and Un
lawful Taxes and They In
sist it Be Stopped.
New York. Jan. 21.-Three hundred
American citizens,* property owners
and residents of the Isle of Pines, says
the Herald's Havana correspondent.
are preparing to resist forcibly, if nec
essary, any further exercise of sover
eignty there by the Cuban government.
Formal demand has been made upon
Minister Sjirers for the protection due
to American citizens on American ter
Minister Squiers for the protection due
with President Palma.
American residents on the island say
they own and occupy more than two
thirds of the land there. They., assert
that the Cuban .government is' levying
oppressive and unlawful taxes in the
Isle of Pines and spending the pro
ceeds in the island ,f Cuba. Admin
istration of justice in the Isle of Pines
is said to be unreliable.
The protesting Americans say they
have'settled in the island with their
families and mean to stay. Before in
vesting their iponey in the purchase
and improvement of real estate they
received official assurances from Wash
ington that the Isle of Pines was ter
ritory of the United States. They re
fuse to pay further taxes to the Cubans
and ask that steps ,be immediately tak
en to establish a government in the is
land under American authority.
E'he situation is becoming serious,
and an' open rupture is likely to occur
if President Palma sends rural guards
to the Isle of Pines to enforce collec
tion of taxes.

MITCHELL'S REPORT.
Decument Deals With a Number of Sub
jects Relating to Miners.
Indianapolis, Jan. 21.-The first
thing on Tuesday's programme of the
Miners National Wage convention was
the reading of John Mitchell's pnnual
report. The convention met promptly
at 9 o'clock with 900 delegates in their
seats.
In his report President Mitchell
said: "For the justice of our claims I
have no fear of the outcome."
The fact that strikes are becoming
less numerous, Mr. Mitchell said, is
due to toe operation of joint agree.
ments Local and general strikes, he
said, occurred more often in districts
where operators refused to recognize
their organization, or treat with its ac'
credited officers.
Mr. Mitchell continued "With each
succeeding year relations become more
cordial between operators and miners
in those districts where tro e agre'"
ments exist and bond munt:' ^1 .iýuif.
dence and " pect have peree'>tihly in
,-creased. 'i ,at the business reiatihrn
ship now existing will continue and
grow as time goes on is my earnest
hope and confident expectation."
Concerning incorporation cf trade
unions Mr. Mitchell submitted an opin"
Ion by Clarence Darrow of Chicago, at
torney for the miners before the strike
commission, in which the following
sentences occur: "Demand for incor
poration of trade unions is the last
trench of those who oppose organized
labor. It is impudent and presumptu
ous. No friend of trade unionism ever
believed in it or advocated it or called
for it. It is demanded by those inter
ests and those. enemies who have used
every means at their command to op"
pose trade unionism to counteract' its
influence or to destroy it. How labor
organizations shall manage their own
affairs is not the business-of corpora
tions or eniployers. This new demand
for incorpcration labor unions Is not
only unjust and unreasonable, but it
is impudent and insulting to the last
degree."

Fairs Gone.
San Francisco, Jan. 21.-A sensa
tional discovery was made, says the
Call, when the personal effects of the

Fair's famous pearl necklace of five
st. ings, valued at $15.000, -had . been
tampered with, and instead of _real
pearls In the necklace cheap Imita
tion gems bad been set In their places.
Numbers of articles of -ewelry which

on credentials was then taen up.
Following the response of Piceiden

Secre'ary Wilson then annoure
the call for the convention.
After the reading of the call, thi
committee on credentials made its re
port. The commfttee on rules and th'
general order of . business was, a',
pointed with instructions to repor
at once.
It was found that many debega e
who were present were not reto
-en favorably for the reason that,
locals they represented had not .it
all of the assessments which had heef
made against them. The report war
unsatisfactpry to many delegates a-ri'
a motion that the committee on c se
dentials be Uistructed to seat all del
egates whose locals are not in arrear.

carried.
The question arose over the anthra
cite workers. On account of the grea'
strike of last summer and fall man:
of the- locals were not able to pay
their assessments.
After work was resumed many o'
the dues were paid but they did not
reach national headquarters in lega
time to be credited. This will be
settled.
