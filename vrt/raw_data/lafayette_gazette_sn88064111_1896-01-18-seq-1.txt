But the man who Is fitted to-think for the

Then dare to be honestly Just what you are.
And dare to be voted a crank:

I A WOMAN'S SAVING HAND.
MY EMILY BARTON,
He was ruined. As be left the gam
i bling house on Kearney streets San
Francisco, and wvahdered out into Gold
en Gate park he had absolutely not a
dollar in his pockets wherewith to pur
chase a lodging or a meal. The down
cast profile was tlLtEir-cut and firm, ar
guing powerful individuality in its
Owner, and yet a mania had seized hire
as it had seized many a weaker man.
and he had staked his all and lost.
The moonlight touched his bowed
head softly, silvered the outlines of his
figure and revealed his haggard white
ness.
It fell on something else-something
that glittered in his hands like steel.
"Stop! Don't do thatl"
It was a woman's voice that spoke, a
woman's touch that tested lightly on
his eleevp, n woman's great dtisky eyes.
set in a face such as one sees but sel
dom in a lifetime, Which were raisetd to
his. She had strolled out to enjoy the
beatuty of the evening, and, absorbed in
meditation, had wandered farther than
she knew.
The man's arm dropped to his side.
lie looked at her in silence, wondering,
admiring, perhaps a little ashamed.
"Why did you want to do it?" pur
sued the gentle voice. "Does life seem
so evil a thing to you?"
"I have been a fool-a madman! I
am ruined!"
"But you are a man. You can work.
You can regain all that you have lost."
He shook his head.
"I cannot find employment here, and
I haven't the means to return to my
home, in Chicago."
Her hand slipped into her pocket and
out again. Adroitly she drew the pistol
away from him and pressed something
Into his hand in its place.
"See, I have bought this thing of
you," she said, hurriedly. "You need
not feel too grateful. Christians should
help each other. If you want to repay
cue, swear to yourself that you will
never do--what you attempted just
now. I must leave you now. Good-by."
And she was gone before he could
stay or thank her-swallowed up and
lost in the shadow of the trees.
"Miss Ferris, allow me to introduce
you to Mr. Fergus Landeck."
The first time they had met alone un
der the stars, in San Francisco; now
they were amid a fashionable gathering
in the home of one of the railroad mag
nates in New York. She was in evening
dress, with diamonds sparkling on her
throat and in her hair.
For an instant she returned his gaze,
questioning, perplexed; then there was
a flash of recognition, and he saw she
knew.
"W'ill you take me into the conserva
tory, MLr. Landeekl It is so warm
here."
They left the ballroom and strolled
under the domed glasshouse where the
palms and lilies grew.
"You have not forgotten, them?"
It was his voice, low and tremulous,
whitch broke the silence.
"No; nor yoU, it seems."
"There are moments in a man's life
which he never forgets. That was one
of them. Do you know I have often 1
wondered whether we should ever meet
again, and I dared not indulge a hope
until this evening, when for the first
time I learned your name. Miss Fer
ris, shall we sit down for awhile? Iam
very grateful for this opportunity of
speaking to you alone. I want-I want
tc return to you, wlth many thanks, the
-the gift you gave me. five years ago. 1
Ah, don't say no. The obligation un
der which you placed me will none the I
less exist, and-and I shall always keep
the little purse, nlwvays--In remem
brance of that night-and you."
"Fortune has evidently favored you
since," she said, after a pause.
"Yes, fortune has indeed favored me,
Miss Ferris. Youl gift was like the en
chanted purses in the children's fairy I
tales-bottomless. It enabled me to
reach the home of nay parents in Chi
cago. I became a reformed man, and
soon secured employment as secretary
to the manager of a car construction
company in Detroit. By industry and
thrift I saved a little money. With it
I bought land in a rising town of North Ia
Dakota. The starting of a big factory
there gave the town a boom, and the
land I had bought for a few hundred
dollars I was able to dispose of for $55,
000. I engaged in other speculations, t
exercising my best judgment, and ev
erything I touched seemed to turn to
gold; whatever I did was right. Mloney
came to me in tens of thousanda. I am
to-day worth $300,000, and if it had mot
been for yeu I should be lying in aui- I
cide'a grave."
Slomething glistened on her lashes.
She drooped her eyes and toyed with
the feathers of her fan.
"I atglad, very glad, you hvre snu- I
seeibded,"'
He gaIted lingeringly on the graeeful
outlines of her figure, the curve of her
full white throat and cheek, the brown
, hair which waved and curved about her
brow and neck.
"And you"--hi roiee sse k lewer still
- - 6tl have hnkt inirrietd 4'
i"Nd, as you see. But it is probable
that I shall lose my freedot soon."
"Does that mean you are engaged?"
"It means that Mr. Harold McCor
I mik the noted stock operator proposed
to me by letter this morning, and that
I am to give him his answer to-night."
"Ahtt is It ti bz 'yi6e9i
She laughed a little.
"Do you know that is a very strange
question to put on so short an acqdflint
ance, andethat our conversation is be
coioing unusual in the extreme? Mr.
Landeck, you seem in forget that we
were introduced nbly hal an hour ago."
"You were piesthit at the tndbt tal
emn moment of my existence. Let me
a little behind the scenes of your own
life," he urged.
fhlt hesitated, and cast ii tr'pid gliinc
at him. Her lips, quivering as with
some hidden emotion, strove to smile.
"We seem fated to have strange con
fldences,' you and 1," She said, and
laughed uncertainly. "If you are very
curious to know, it is 'yes.' I shall ac
cept hitli."
Perhaps it uica otiljr Lfney or tUs
flickering of the gas lights, but it
seemed as though a sudden spasm
crossed his face, boret of disappoiht
ment or of painH
"Ybu care for him, of course?"
An utncontrollable impulse moved the
woman to dash aside the barrier of con
ventionality and give expression tO
what she felt. She railied her eyes to
his. they met, and the anguish in
them touched him to the heart. She
shook her head merely, then turned
her face away.
"Then tell me why you are going to
marry him."
"Because he is rich. and my father's
property is heavily mortgaged. I may
as well tell you the reason; everybody
will know."
"You ihtend to sacrifide ydiUtself fhe
your faamily's sake?"'
"'Sariilfcel What an ugly way of put
ting It! I am going to make a 'mar
riage of convenience.' Other women
are doing the same thing every day."
There was silence, save for the sub
dued sound of distant music.
They were alone.
In the dim light of the eonservatory
the man was blind to all but the white
clad form against the mass of foliage.
The heavy perfume of the exotics
seemed to rise and stifle him; the wom
an's beauty intoxicated his senses; the
consciousness of her presence thrilled
his very soul.
He leaned over and touched her gent
ly on the arm.
"Sylvia, we are scarcely more than
strangers, you and I. Perhaps you'll
tell me I am mad. But 1 love you
Heaven knows I love you. I berleve I
loved you-then. Sylvia, will you-oh,
for pity's sake, take me instead of him?"
"A most romantic affair," said the
society papers when they were mar
ried. "He proposed to her the first time
they met."-N. Y. Weekly.

lefusalm of a Scotch Photographer to
"Take" Opera SIngers
An English operatic company whose
members recently returned to London
after a tour in Scotland had a curious
experience in one of the inland towns
where a performance was given. It
was one of those places where, among
certain classes, the animnus against the
itters is almost as great as the consump
tion of whisky. As it was the last halt
in the tour the members of the troupe
agreed to have themselves photo
graphed and accordingly went to the
local photographer and explained their
intention. "WVerra weel," replied the
Scotchman. "1 sail be verra gled to
tak yer portrcts, for ye seem a douce
and respectable set o' leddles and gen
tlemen." "And as we are artists," sug
gerated the principal tenor, "and there
are lots of us, perhaps you would see
no objection to making some reduction
from your usual prices?" "Ertists, are
ye?" said the photographer. "I dinna
ken what that may be, but what dae ye
t4ae, may I speer?" "Oh," answered the
tenor, who fortunately understood the
Scotch language, "we are singers." "In
the kirk?" queried the camera manip
ulator. "Oh, no," replied the other, "we
are the opera company who are per
forming at the theater."
The Scotchman took a step back
warmt, iaised his arms into the air and
cried: "Awn' wi'ye; awa' wi' ye! Ye
are the deevil's bairns, ye are,and I wad
na photograph ye for naething-I mean
for onything ye would offer me-no,
not for a' the money ye tak' in a week
for playin' BSatan's antics on the brods.
Ertists ye en' yerselsl Ye are children
or the deevil, ye arel" And he ordered
them out and shut the door against
them. This is the reason why no au
thentic photograph of that opera troupo
will be handed down to posterity, for
next day the tour ended and the mem
bers dispersed to their homes.-Londoa

Some Of these o i-ners hate sought to
cultivate their land by hired Chinatneh
or by leasing to tenanits; largely for
eigners; but the great acreage ihas been
given over to vast herds of cattle, horses
and sheep.
This state has her share of electric

calls for an investment in seeling and
irrigating. Grain growing formerjly
yielded large returns by means of the
machinery Used, which first attained
perfection in this state, biut is now out
of the question on lands held at tiihese
prices.
Fruit growing, for which California
is and ever will be distinguished above
all the other states of the union, re
quires an investment on each acre equal
to or greater than the price of the land,

owners had no dif fctilty in placing
mortgages of $5,000 to $500,000; Pay
day comes finally, however, when prin
cipal, as well as interest, must be met,
and there is no alternative except to let
the property go at reduced prices.
While this is t disappointment to many
families, itiho hoped to see the nsteg
nificent estates go to theiir childreh,
perhaps for generations to come, yet it
will be of incalculable benefit to the
state.
These great landed estates in
clude many of the most desirable lands
in the valleys, which selections were
made in early days and purchased as
Spanish grants, often at a nominal
price. Other raniches, sometimes con
prising hundreds of thousands of acres,
were purchased in part from railroad
grants of every alternate or the odd
numbered sections or square miles,
while the even numbered sections were
acquired from the United States
through the various land laws, and
finally gathered into the millionaire's
estate. This land monopoly, which has:
so retarded real development, is cer
tainly giving way under the pressure
of the new conditions.
Most of the great lords of the soil
have passed already Intp the sear and
yellow leaf; while several have dropped
by e way, and, and their surviving
pain ers, or heirs, evince less and less
desire to pay taxes on the whole world.
Much of the land which is coming on
the market at prices within the reach
of people who are looking for homes is
already under irrigation, and canals are
extending their beneficent waters over
other drybutwonderfully fertile tracts.
Hitherto the subdivision of lands and
welcoming of immigrants has taken
place chiefly in a few localities, but the
forced conditions above described exist
in all portions of the state.
While California is better adapted
to specialties in vegetation than any
other state, by reason of her great va
riety of climatic and soil conditions, it
remains true here, as elsewhere, that
the family which produces on its own
acres its supply of vegetables, milk,
butter, eggs, poultry, meat, fruit and
nuts, as well as grass and grain for the
domestic animals, is independent of
market fluctuations. The fact that
such results are easiest attained in an
arid region under irregation was first
set before the American public by Hior
ace Greeley when the Tribune proposed
the Greeley colony for Colorado. That
was an experiment, but its successful
results and all that has been learned
during these years in the arts of agri
culture, horticulture and Irrigation are
now common property, and at the com
mand of the most inexperienced.
The flurry which was excited by the
Judge Ross decision adverse to the
Wright irrigation law is passing away,
and the hope is generally expressed
that the United States supreme court,
where the case is soon to be heard, will
rule against the Wright law. The
bondholders will be protected where
value has been received, and other and
fairer ways will be worked out than are
provided under that law. In fact, only
a comparatively small portion- of tihe
irrigation of this state was begun under
the Wright law, and capitalists were
from the first disinclined to invest in
those securities.-N. Y. Tribune.

-How to Cook Ment.-Take care the
fire is made up thoroughly, and all the
various cooking utensils required are
ready for use, clean, and at hand. The
joint should be overhauled and cleansed
where necessary. Baked meat should
always be placed upon a trivet, and
that in a baking tin, care being taken
that the joint is placed in the center of
the dish, and does not touch the sides
of the oven. Ventilate the oven. Boiled
fresh meat should be immersed in boil
ing water, as the heat draws out the
substance which forms a coating that
retains the juice of the joint. Broiling
wants special care, such as a clear fire
and warm gridiron. Coke is better than
coal. Frying: Pan should be warmed
first and then fat thoroughly boiling.
Meat or fish should not be put on till
fat boils. Stewing: The joint in this
case is placed in cold water, and should
simmer only, never really boil. This
takes a much longer time than either
boiling or poasting.-Liverpool Mer

A Progreslsive Nation.
Denmark, although a small country,
and relatively thinly populated, can
certainly lay claim to be the most pro
r~ressive nation in Europe, and is deter
mined not to permit the grass to grow
under its feet. The state schools which
the government has established for
popular instruction in the most advan
tageous methods of making butter and
other agricultural and farm produce,
which constitute the staple industry'
of the kingdom, have already achieved
a success the fame of which extends
throughout Europe, and even to such
far-off countries as Japan and Siam.
The construction of the Kiel canal by
the Germans has had its counterpart in
the organization of a magnificent free
port at Copenhagen, and now within
the last ten days a railroad ferry line
has been estblished from the Danish
capital to Malmoe in Sweden, by means
of which a tourist can travel all the way
from Cadiz, in Spain, or Constantinople,
in Turkey, to the northernmost point
of Norway and Sweden without leaving
the train.-N. Y. Tribune.
