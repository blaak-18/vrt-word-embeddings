" READ THIS!
We send out several samplle
copies this week, take them and
read them, and if you think you
can Support a paper that is run in
the interest of the people, send us
your dollar andi we will send you
the paper for one year, or if you
land rather take it on trial for six
months send us fifty cents. Give
us a trial anyway.
SALUTATORY.
In appearing before the peoplej
of the great city and parish of
Natchitoches an;d the public at
large as editor of the LorsrANA
POPULIST, we do so fully realizing
the sacred duties and obligations
we assume toward a great people.
Human nature is vari&l and there
are as many minds as there are
many men, and for any man to pre
same his ability to please all would
be assuming an arrogance border
lng. on imbecility. Therefore, in
our mind the only safe line of poli
ey to pursue is one that will give
equal justice to all, commending
what is right and condemning that
which is wrong, contending for the
sad that will bring lpeace, happi
ness and prosperity to all alike.
1ealizrng the great andt powerful
influence wielded by the public
piess our efiorts will be directed to
the aoial, moral and religious up
buildinllg of a eeuntry we love, be
eauuse it is oar native land, leaving
every one free to exercise his own
moral, religious, social and political
ogiaions as dictated by his own
iPdipgment and couscieunce, at the
i ie Ale offering our columns to
iin who may differ with us for a
she and dispaseonate discussion
e· lAimportant issues, for in the
multitude of oldion great truths
are revealel.
In polities the POPULIST will be
devoted to the education of the
people in the great principles of the
keople's party. We believe that in
,all republican forms of government
the masses of the people ahould be
a,r ht intoelese relationship with
the Indamental principles of that
mvernment. This can only be
deme by a gteui of education that
ea reseh the nma at the plow, at
the re, and in all stations iand
·mdilk Sin s in life, this the People's
- proposes to do and by this
S us wry a wonderful reform to
'a 01ostsful termination. It is a
eeatl .reetion upon this country
tht after . most wonderfhl eareer

.men to assist us in (ontendl'ug for

out it our boasted freedomi is but a

Democrantic Economy.
The )Demiocrats in the last eain
paign proit:sed to give us aln Cecno)
mical administration if elected. but
instead they have extended their
extravagance beyond all human
comprehension, in otfher words, ex
elusive of pensions. President
Cleveland, fbr his first full fiscal
year expended $1,295,677 more to
carry on the government than was
expended in the final fiscal year
ending President Harrison's ad
iministration.
There have been many increases
in the salaries of l)eiocrtic offi
cials, especially in diplomnatic and
consular service. The salary of
the first assistant Secretary of State
is increased fromt $3,500 to $4,500.
The minister to Belgium is increas
ed front $7,500 to $10,000. The
ministers to Switzerland and Port
ugal, Messrs. Caruth and Brcadij
head, are increased from $5,000 to
$6,500. The minister to Mexico,
who receives an annual salary of
$17,500 has the salary of his secre
tary of legation increased from
$t000 to $2,550. The minister to
Nicaragua and Costa ltica, for the
first time, are allowed secretaries
of legation at $1800. Inl addition
to this, there has been estahblished
the ofIlioe of a clerk tfr each mer
ber of Congres, at a salary of $100
per mouth, anti other extravagance
too numerous to mention here.
How can the Democrats ask the
farmers of this country, whose pro
duc has! ,en shrinking in vahle
at a ruitous ate, or the laborers, I
whose wages have been reduced
to starvatioin rates, to support I
or fellow it any longer. It is
ertaitunly not reasonable that the
people will follow any flrther a
party that has deceived them. The
people who have these increased
salaries to pay, must increase the
sweat drops in order that more cot i
ton, corn, wheat, oats, etc., may be I
forthcomting. They rire forced to
compete with a declining market
produced by the destruction of one- ti
half of the money of the people, t
and this done too by the party that
detnatds more sweat for the increa s- f
ed salaries of oflcials. Why should c
Cleveland'*appoinaeee xeceive more
salary than hmas been paid others a,
for doing the same work for years? ii
We see tino justice in it. li
The strike Commwuion is still at
work, and many prominent men
have testihed before the committee
that all the destruction of proper-!
ty and other devilment done 4ur'
ing the great strike, was done by
totghs that were not strikers, or i ;
any manner eoniiaeted with the ,
ralroad. The conseniius of ophnioii ii
is that the most practical manner ,
of settling the differei'es between
railroad emiployes atad emiiljloyers is, a
the goverumnnt owuershlil of raill-i
roads. ie
