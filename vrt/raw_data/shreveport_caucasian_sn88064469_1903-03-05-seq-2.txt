Uncle Sam's
Big Game
Preserves
[ISpecial Correspondence.]
Lander, \Vyo., Feb. 24.-At least in
point of area, Uncle Sam has the lar
gest zoo in the world, though there are
others into which are huddled a greater
variety of animal life. This is the Yel
lowston National park. embrac('ing
3,s000 square filies, where roam at will
uncounted herds of wild animals in
digenous to the country-buffalo, elk,
fleer. antelolpe and the like.
The Yellowstone park is an ideal and
unique big game plreserve, and as there
is no open season here the animals are
safe from the huntsman, becoming ab
solutely fearless of injury from man.
Although they are as wild as the wild
est mountain forest can produce, every
species knows to a nicety the boundary
of the preserve and keeps within it.
Even the timid deer have lost their
sense of fear and the noise of a dis
charging gun has no terror for them.
It is not an unusual thing to see a
group of them grazing within a few
rods of a posthouse or hotel, apparent
ly satisfied that no harm can come to
them under Uncle Sam's protecting
care. The firing of the sundown gun
a twelve pounder-will not cause them
to stop munching the bunch grass
which they have kicked up under the
snow. But the hauling down of the
flag will attract their curious attention
much more than the noise of the gun.
The park is patrolled thoroughly by
the government to prevent the shooting
of the animals. Two troops of cavalry
are divided into single scouts and pa
trol the 3,000 square miles of the park
constantly, and as the years go by and I
this plan is continued the game comes
to know and not to fear its human pro
tectors. Poachers receive fair trial be
fore a United States judge, but if it ap
pears that they are on the reservation
for the purpose of destroying the game
they are dealt with in accordance with
the severe laws provided.
Public sentiment among the residents
surrounding the park has been awak
ened, and their sympathies, which at I
first seemed not to be favorable to the
plan of game preservation, have now t
become thoroughly in harmony with
Aid intent of the government.
Under these wise provisions the
numbers of each species have greatly
increased until now the park is full

of big game, making it a very para
dim for the huntei, If he were only
permitted to hunt. However, he can
emly look on -in wonder.ed with -such
pleasure as a true sportsman can feel
tI the passive contemplation of what
would be a splendid shot.
In late years black and brown bears
have been increasing in numbers and
ean be seen at any time feeding on the
garbage piles at the emp posts and ho
tels. These bears are perfectly harm
less so long as they are kept in a wild
state, but when they are fed and pet
ted, as some of them have been in the
past, they lose all fear of human be
ings and are liable to do considerable
damage to property and provisions.
They are also liable to frighten tour
ists by following them with the expec
tation of being fed. Several of the
black aid brown bears that had been
too thorqughly civilized had to be killed
last sumnr because of their sociable
instincts.
One of the most interesting expeti
ments which are being conducted in the
Yellowstone park at present is the en
deavor to raise buffaloes. At the last
session of congress $15,000 was appro
priated in a bill for the purpose of pro
viding an inclosure and securing a
small herd of buffaloes. This intention
on the part of the national legislators
has been carried out, the inclosure has
been provided and a small herd estab
lished within it. The buffaloes are ap
, parently doing well, and as the herd in
creases they will be given the freedom
of the entire park.
In the matter of fishing the policy of
the government is less restrictive than
in hunting. Trout fishing is allowed in
the pArk, and in the clear lakes and
mountain streams much fine sport can
be had. That there may be no cessa
tion to this sport it has been recom
mended that a small fish hatchery shall
be established in the park. Seven mil
lion black spotted troutwere hatched
in Yellowstone lake last seaso..
Yellowstone park has been aptly des
ignated "the wonderland of tie United
States" and is year by year attracting
tourists in increasing nufnbers. Con
gress has begun to realize the worth of
this gkme reservation, and the appro
priations which have been made dur
ing the past few years have been such
as to permit of many improvements to
the park which were greatly needed.
Much has been done in the way of road
building and repairing, and the pleas
are and comfort of a trip through the
park have been greatly enhanced there
by. TI~e railroads have also begun to
asbow an interest in the park, and the
travel~tg public is to have an easier ae
mee than eretofore.
