He married Eliza E. Evans, Decem
ber 17, 1868, who with eight children
and fourteen grandchildren survive
him.
After coming out of the service, he
went into reform work, being one of
the organizers of the People’s Party,
of which he has been a faithful ad
herent ever since. His five sons and
two sons-in-law are also still in the
fight. He was a great admirer of T.
E. Watson and Judge S. W. Williams,
whom he helped to nominate at their
last convention. He was also present
at a number of other national conven
tions, going as a delegate from his
state.
His wife and family have lost a
true husband and father and the com
munity an honest, upright and
straight-forward citizen.
“POPULISTS NOT DEAD OR DEAF
IN TEXAS.’’
• * r t • - •
Flowery Branch, Ga., Feb. 11 1909.
The Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga.
Gentlemen: Find enclosed $1.50,
for which send me your weekly Jef
fersonian, etc., as per card received.
Am glad to avail myself of the offer.
Were I a writer, or even a talker,
would tell you of my love and regards
for our beloved Tom Watson. lam
a charter member of the old ' Pop
party in Hall, and I’ll tell you she is
not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb. Hur
rah, she spurns the ring rule same as
ever; she lives, she breathes, she’ll
come, she’ll come. Pass it down the
line. Yours gladly,
Alfred Maddox.
ANOTHER WORD ON MISSIONS.
Coffee Springs, Ala., Feb. 22, 1909.
I have read your editorials on the
mission question with much interest,
and do most heartily agree with you.
I am not opposed to educating and
Christianizing the heathen ; have never
been. But I think it blind charity
and misguided zeal to go thousands of
miles in search of objects of pity
on whom to bestow our open-hearted
ness, and neglect our people round
about us who need our help so much.
From, a moral standpoint, we have
millions of men and women in Amer
ica in need of the gospel whose moral
standard is not superior to the heathen
we are trying to Christianize. Al
most every daily paper teems with
crimes as black as hell itself; and
it seems to me that if our surplus
money and energy were spent a few
thousand miles this side of Asia our
almshouses and prison cells might be
partially emptied, our homes made
more secure, and probably our women
in some of our cities could take an
afternoon walk without police protec
tion.
I have on my desk before me a lit
tle pamphlet containing some educa
tional statistics issued by the State
Department of Education at Mont
gomery. This pamphlet says that there
are in Alabama 443,590 white children
over ten years of age who are illiter
ate. Think of it! The great State of
Alabama containing a half million il
literate children, children who have
reached the age when the basis of an
education should be nearing comple
tion and they haven’t started I And
what is true of Alabama is true of
other States in a greater or less de
gree. To neglect these and send our
help to foreign peoples seems to me
a shortsighted policy; for no nation
can rise above the individuals that
compose it. And if we expect this
nation to rise to the summit of its
glory and maintain a government of
the people and for the people; and
if we expect to hand down to pos
terity a civilization richer than we
found it, we can not afford to be
growing crops of illiterate children a
half million strong in a single state.
Respectfully, J. W. Steely.
BETHANY.
Vienna, Ga., Feb. 14, 1909.
My Dear Mr. Watson: I suppose
it js no uncommon thing for men and
women to admire your “Bethany,”
and write you how they were held by
it and shed tears at the latter part;
and then tell you how you are en
shrined in their hearts.
This being true, I do not like to do
a common thing—follow a customary,
worn-out path. But you will pardon
while I deter you in your busy duties
to say your sad, sweet story held me
stronger than the Mariner held the
wedding guest. It made me love the
pure, sweet Nellie, rejoice in Ralph’s
winning her instead of the preacher;
and, at the close my “tears fell like
the rain.”
“Bethany” will touch any man who
has a heart. I have spent today—
Sunday—reading it and feel I am a
better man.
Such a strong sentiment and such
a fascinating story touch men’s hearts
and you bless their lives. My father
is an old-line Populist and I follow
after him and both of us love Tom
Watson. Yours, W. L. 5...
PREFERS DEATH TO STATE SAN
ITARIUM.
Kingston, Ga., Feb. 7, 1969.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson —My Dear
Sir: lam sending you clippings from
the Rome Tribune-Herald which hope
you will publish in your Jeffersonian.
I believe that hell-house at Milledge
ville ought to be inspected. I hope
you will do all you can to get Mr.
Bell freedom. Respectfully,
L. D. Broadwater.
RURAL TELEPHONES IN TEXAS.
The old time plaint that public own
ership will not work, is a back num
ber so far as this part of the country
is concerned. One of our most im
portant public utilities is absolutely
owned and controlled by the people
themselves.
About five years ago a few farmers
organized a co-operative rural tele
phone association with only two dozen
members; now, the Rural Telephone
Union, an organization growing out
of it, covers whole counties, giving
free service throughout the system.
There are good exchanges at more
than a score of towns and villages
and these exchanges are connected by
trunk lines, owned jointly by the ex
changes are connected.
To say that seventy-five per cent,
of the farmers, including renters, have
’phones is putting it mildly. Indeed,
in some places it seems that the R.
*T. U. is about to outstrip the R. F.
D. The R. T. U. exchanges at Ber
tram and Liberty Hill have more rural
patrons than the post offices have.
After the cost of installing is met,
the expense of the system is trifling,
3effersonlan
ranging from $1.50 to $3.00 per year
and this includes the entire service.’
As an illustration of the phenominal
growth of the telephone union, one
town will order a car load of tele
phones soon to be used in that im
mediate community.

“STARTING RIGHT.”
Clifton Jordan, Boston, Ga.: lam
a little boy twelve years old and have
one dollar of my own which I send
you to renew my father’s subscription
to the Jeffersonian, as he says he can
not spare the money, and we all like
to read your paper so well we can’t
afford to do without it.
“ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE
OLD GUARD CONTRIBUTES TO
CAMPAIGN FUND.”
Dr. Abram Neff, La Luz, N. Mexico:
I take pleasure of once more address
ing you and enclosing draft for three
dollars and ten cents, for which please
renew my subscription to the two Jef
fersonians and ten cents for a few
of the Tom Watson watermelon seed
that are advertised in your paper by
a namesake of yours; all to be sent
to my address. The other dollar I
wish to be placed to your credit for
past campaign fund, and I hope that
many other subscribers will do like
wise until you are fully reimbursed
for what you expended in the last
campaign. I have always supported
you in all of your publications, from
the first reform paper you ever pub
lished to the present time, and as you
have never wobbled in the faith, I
can claim as much for myself and as
long as you remain steadfast, so will
I. Many of my friends in Missouri
displayed like Bryan, a backbone of
sand.
From your incipieney in the re
form work 1 have admired your course
and have ever been ready to uphold
your hands in the noble work that
you have undertaken and pursued.
Through the last campaign I could
render you but little assistance as in
the territory where I am temporarily
living, we had no vote in the-presiden
tial contest, but my prayers were daily
for your protection and preservation
and that God would increase your
powers and ability to present the con
ditions as they exist to the American
people.
Your first utterances to your fol
lowers after your campaign was en
couraging to the old guard, who have
watched and followed your every foot
step for the past many years. I hope
the conference you spoke of at the
close of your canvass will be held be
fore the close of the year 1909, and
that a perfect and systematic plan
may be evolved by which a satisfac
tory organization of all reformers
may be reached.
“ENCOURAGEMENT FROM GEOR
GIANS NOW LIVING IN
MISSISSIPPI.”
J. R. Heggie, Vaiden, Miss.: En-

Os this use $6 for the list of books
which I enclose, and apply the bal
ance to the fund to reimburse you for
the expenses incurred in the last cam
paign.
Sleep
Sleep is nature’s re
building period, when the
energy used by the brain,
muscles and organs is re
newed. If you lose sleep,
your system is robbed of
the strength sleep should
give. Continued loss of
sleep multiplies this loss
until you become a phys
ical wreck. Dr. Miles’
Nervine quiets the irri
tated nerves and brings
refreshing, invigorating
sleep. Nervine contains
no opiates, and therefor
leaves no bad after-effects.
“For over two years I suffered un
told agonies; my triends thought I
was going crazy. I could not sleep
nor rest at all. I tried different doc
tors, but failed to find relief. My
head would ache all the time; I was
like one drunk; could not concentrate
my mind, and was so restless and
worried that sleep was out of the
question. After taking one bottle of
Dr. Miles’ Nervine I felt wonderfully
changed. I am now on my third bot
tle and am gaining all the time. I
can lie down and sleep like a child,
and am able to do my work.”
MRS. MAY SCOTT. English, Ind.
Your druggist sells Dr. Miles’ Nerv
ine, and we authorize him to return
price of first bottle (only) if It falls
to benefit-you.

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown In
Georgia. It has every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
