HEN the Jeffersonian
decided to have a page
for its feminine read
ers and earnestly invited
them to consider it
theirs —to fill it with the
the things of which they
were thinking—to follow
eo
freely any line they
ehose—>wo awaited the response with
vast interest, which is an altogether
different thing from mere curiosity.
The result has been a little bit sur
prising, but the surprise has been
wholly of ah agreeable nature. In
stead of the inconsequent or the tri
vial, the humdrum and the commoii
place, there has come in each in
stance conclusive and most gratify
ing evidence that the women into
whose homes our paper goes have
reached a mental altitude which enti
tles them to leadership in the realm
of affairs.

It would be a poor complirtient to
ally individual, arid ail undeserved
disparagement of the human sister
hood, to say that she was “above the
average/’ We like to feel, rather,
that the entire average is steadily
improving, constantly climbing high
er, leaving the foothills for the moun
tains glorious. So, we will not say
that any one woman, or any one let
ter, has impressed us as “above the
average,” but do feel no hesitation
in saying that the Jeffersonian con
tributor's are much above the aver
age of those who generally write to
other periodicals.

There had been no expectation that
political questions would come up —
and, lo! nearly every letter has ex
hibited an understanding of National
issues and a spirit of true Jefferson
ian zeal which augurs well for the
ultimate success of those principles
of Democratic government which
must prevail if our common country
is to regain and preserve the freedom
for which it was founded.

Perhaps, after all, it will lie with
the women of our land to accomplish
this, the loftiest achievement the
Twentieth century can know. “Who
saves his country saves all things,”
and should our institutions fail —
should the light die here —how ter
ribly would we have neglected our re-'
sponsibility toward all humanity, for
all the ages to come!

The greatness of ancient Greece
was not alone due to the fact that
her people possessed genius, but to
the system of slave-holding which en
abled a leisure class to develop its
manifold talents. This class was not
analogous to our negligible quantity
of “idle rich,” but simply meant that
the native Greeks as a whole had
time enough left from other pursuits
to enjoy, appreciate, encourage, un
derstand and create systems of phil
osophy and art which may never be
surpassed. In America, today, what
leisure class have we except our
women? Lazy, few are, but, happily.

both within and Without the home
life are most women cheerfully pro
tected from the more sordid and try
ing experiences which are a matter of
course in the lives of the opposite
sex. And, since men regard as sacred
the obligation thus to shield all wom
ankind, is it not the privilege and
the duty of those go spared the
heavier toil and more continuous wor
ries, to hold fast to the ideals which
men, in the heat of partisan politics
and the hurry of business affairs,
temporarily lose sight of? Surely.

Where a husband has but time, per

"Tollow Thou Me.”
How can we follow when the way is dark,
And up above the hill toils higher yet,
\ And the dread load we bear is care and cark
And otir dim eyes with bloody tears are wet?
Is it right? Oh, tell us is it right that those
Who love Thee find reward in gall and blight,
And meet the thorn and ne’er the perfumed rose,
While others win prosperity’s sweet light?
How can we follow when Thy face is hid,
Or wears a frown that chills our very blood?
How can we follow, till our souls are rid
Os all the woe that is our daily food?
Oh, God! Thy words seem laden with a sneer,
When evil flaunts its banners in our face,
And shows its power almost potent here,
Its pride and pomp, its altitude of place!
i
How can we follow when we see cast down
The saints who followed from their early youth,
And led such unsoiled lives, the brightest crown
Could add no luster to their brows of truth?
And yet to them all joy and song denied
Through years of pain, and toil and tempest, led
They bore with Thee the cruel spear-torn side,
And died in bitter woe with thorn-pierced head!
*
Is loving Thee a crime to be full paid
In poverty’s fierce clutch, in anguished hour,
In home ties wreck in hollow coffins made,
Where lie entombed life’s fairest fruit and flower?
Small wonder, then, that few can keep the faith,
When rotting earth roust be their place and past;
When life is dust, and the wild thrill of death
Is welcome as a friend who comes at last!
, Hamilton Jay.
ing. Consciously or unconsciously, he
will absorb and utilize the informa
tion she thus acquires. As for the
children, any school teacher will tell
you the difference in the capacity to
learn between pupils from book-lov
ing homes and those where neither
the father nor the mother takes any
interest in solid literature. And the
daily table talk of a cultured family
is worth about as much to young
sons and daughters as a university
training in after years.

■So, whether “votes for women” be
viewed with hope or dismay, the re
sponsibility of women is as clear on
political lines as any other. The
Farnjers ’ Alliance owed pinch of its
3effersonidn
success to the enthusiasm of its fem
inine members, and never dreamed
of shutting them out. It is reassur
ing to note that the same spirit is
with us still and that the contribu
tors to this department sympathize
with the sentiments which were crys
tallized in the Ocala platform and
are anxious to do all in their power
to encourage and aid.

The way of reform does not lie
along the primrose path. To be a
Populist means to encounter super
cilious smiles and shrugs—even
sneers. Yet —women are not physi
cal or moral cowards. The world
would come to a standstill if they
were either. What do you imagine
is the daily meed of insult and dan
ger which is fearlessly encountered
by refined and delicate ladies in the
foreign mission field? And cannot
we afford to ignore so small a cross
as a raised eyebrow or a trifling so
cial slight?

Then let us be up and doing.
Georgia and the South will lead the
radicals henceforth —and the Jeffer
sonian women will not be indifferent
to the movement. Someone has sug
gested that we . form clubs. Is it
practicable to do so? Would not
such clubs be pleasant and profita
ble? If so, who will be the first to
respond w’ith a good working plan
for us to follow?
CHILDREN AND READINCk
By E. S. Martin.
I find it a matter of very genOfal
solicitude with parents to find some
means of inducing their children to
read improving books while they have
the chance. I don’t find many par
ents whose success in this endeavor
matches their efforts or their hopes.
Bookcases with glass doors and mo
notonous looking sets of books behind
them are comparatively scarce. Os
course you may lead a child to a li
brary, and even leave him there, and
not be able to make him read; but *•
he is more likely to read a library
than he is to read the parlor book
case, especially if the bookcase is
locked because the books in it are so
nicely bound. Familiarity with
books—even if only with the backs
of them —seldom breeds contempt. It
is much more apt to breed friendship,
and sometimes it breeds strong affec
tion like that for dear people.
The enormous dimensions of the
mass of human knowledge as con
tained in books is liable to daunt
young readers, and discourage them
from even nibbling at so huge a cakx
The long books are so long, and there
are so many of them, and life, all
told, is but a span! Help the young
readers to a release from that burden
some feeling and to appreciation of
the truer sentiment that a good book
is the record of the thoughts of a
good mind, and that, whether one
reads much or little of it, contact
with the mind that made it is profit
able. —Harper’s Magazine.
SACKING THE TUILERIES.
An Incident of the Revolution of 1848
In France.
The sight that presented itself was
the strangest I have ever seen and
has remained in my memory almost
as vividly as if it were yesterday.
The magnificent apartments of the
palace were soon filled with as strange
a set of ruffians as you could meet
anywhere. It seemed as if they were
all mad or drunk, and yet they were
as jolly as sand boys. They seemed
positively to revel in destruction and
to yell with delight as they smashed
and tore everything in pieces that
they came across. There w T as scarcely
a picture that was not cut into rib
bons, and ornaments, however costly,
were thrown down and broken to
atoms.
While I was standing in one of the
grand apartments, looking on in won
der, a little man, with a sword al
most as big as himself, stood in front
of a magnificent mirror that reached
from the floor to the ceiling. He sur
veyed it for a moment, and then, as
though he were about to storm a town
single handed, went deliberately up to
it and with one blow of his great
cavalry blade shivered it to pieces.
As they fell at his feet, he put on a
grand air and said, “La!” as if this
was one of the greatest deeds he had
ever accomplished and the proudest,
