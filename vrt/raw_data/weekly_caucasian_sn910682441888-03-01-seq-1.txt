Fate of John Ramsay, M. D,
BY TV. H. S. ATKINSON.
I am a physician. I have made a life
long study of tho human brain, and
may, perhaps, ba pardoned if I say that
my opinions upon diseases of tho mind
now carry considerable weight among
members of tha profession.
It is only a week or two sinca I wa
called to a large asylum for the insane iu
Northern Ohio to examine a case which
baffled th3 skill of the local doctor?.
Alter disposing of tint matter I took an
unprofessional stroll through the insti
tution in company with my old friend,
the superintendent.
The asylum over which I now made a
tour of inspection w is a most beautiful
build ing, resembling in its appoint
ments the homes of the wealthy and
opulent. Wo wandered through room
nfter room and along successive halls
and corridors where men and women in
every stago of insanity passed the time
in various harmless amusomcnts, or were
restlessly confined ia tho cars of ward
ers and nurses. Of all tho misfortunes
to which humanity is heir, this loss of
reason is, to my mind, tho saddest by
far; and, though I might be expected to
have grown hardened by long years of
familiarity with all phases of weak in
tellect, I never cca;e to feel devoutly
thankful for that greatest of all benefits
conferred upon men by r. beneficent Cre
ntor a sound brain.
We had passed through the greater
part of tho enormous institution and
wero approaching that portion of the
building set apart for the rcsilenco of
the superintending physician my
friend, Dr. Habcrshon. Taking from
hia pocket a key, Dr. Hatcrsh.on In
serted it in the keyhole of a door. Bo
fore turning it, he looked at me in a
strange manner and said: "If you
were not an old med., Hartly, an I as
familiar with strange cases as I am my
self, I should warn you to keep your
countenance and betray no surprise on
entering hero. And I speak, anyhow,
so as to be on tho safe side." So say
ing he turned the key in tho lock and
opened the door. We quietly entered a
very neat but plainly furnished room,
and I confess that, although I have
witnessed queer, weird, wild and. oft
times blood-curdling sights, I never felt
so startled in all my life as I did at that
moment The room was not by any
means dark, for it was well lighted by
a large window running all along one
side, but placed above the reach of a
man, even though he should stand upon
a chair; yet at the farther end of tho
room I noticed a student's lamp burniug
over a plain pine-wood table, upon
which rested a human skull and some
writing paper. Seated at this table,
pencil in hand, was a man about the
same age as myself and Dr. Ilabershon
(40 years) gazing intently upon the
skull. What startled me so severely
was tho fact that when I had last seen
that man more than fifteen years since
I had seen him iu exactly
such a position, with precisely similar
surroundings. And yet, what a dif
ference! Then he had just graduated
at the head of hij class from our col
lege, and was looked upon as one of the
most promising young physicians in the
country now, he was a helpless maniac !
"Ramsay?" I involuntarily queried,
only partially , believing my own eye-
onnoadea. "You need

Ittmsay, Hibcrho3 and myself were
nil students together ia Philadelphia.
We were in ths same classes in college
and jointly occupied the same suite of
room. Furthermore we were all mak
ing a specialty of studying the human
materially differed from each other wti
tint Ramsay knew more than we two
fellows together.
True, Rnmiay w&, in regard to hii
theories and speculations, what many
people would call a "crank" but then
succsssful cranks are esteemed to be
gcniuies, and certainly Rsmsay was, in
my judgment, quite as near tho one as
the other.
Wo three follows all fitted in the
same social set, and although Loth Ram
say and Hibershon knew good and
beautiful fcirls by the score, the fates
decreed that they should fall in love
with tho same young lady. And yet,
strange cnoticrh, they never displayed
bail feeling toward each other, nor ever
sought to make tin lady's position an
unpleasant one on account of the rivalry.
It seemed to me, an onlooker, as though
there was a tacit understanding between
O
them, that no undue influence should be
brought into play, but that, knowing
how both loved and admired her, the
object of their admiration and esteem
should be left quietly to choose between
them.
(J race Thorncy croft was a most beau
tiful and estimable girl and, though I
have been an old bachelor all my days,
I do not wonder that any man should
have sought her for hi) wife.
Ono day Grace, with her father,
mother and a brother, were down to
Atlantic City, where they took a sail
boat and went out. A sudden squall
overtaking them tho frail pleasure boat
was upset and Graco was tho only mem
ber of tho party who escaped with her
life. She was picked up in a fainting
condition and tenderly cared for, but
that her mind was shattered she was
insane. All that wealth, combined with
skill, could do was done for Grace, but
it availed nothing and tho physicians
and friends at last gave up the case as
hopeless. Hiberihon was himself al
most crazy with grief and could not
bear to go near tho poor girl. As for
Ramsay, ho shut himself up in his den
a small, barely furnished room whsro
he was in the habit of pursuing his
studies and experiments. There was a
determined expression on the fellow's
face and when I looked in on him
(which was seldom) he was always busy
with his papers and books sometimes
engaged in dissecting the brains of dogs
and other animals, and onco examining
a human brain.
He seldom spoke or even so much as
remarked my presence, though once he
said in an excited tone: "I shall cure
her, Hartly it shall bo done at any
cost."
So for day3 and weeks he sat ovor
that bare pine tablo gazing at the skull
in front of him ever and anon rapidly
penciling diagram of tho human brain
and of tho nervous system.
Late one evening I was sitting with
Ilabershon when there came a rap at
the door and Rinnay entered. Ho was
very quiet, but knowing him as well as
I did I could tell he had something
beyond the ordinary on his mind.
' Boys," ho said, "I think I have
found what I have been searching for
I think I can cure Grace. I say think,
because, after all, it is only a theory of
mine and mny utterly fail, but I think
not. Perhaps you Bay I ab.ou.ld not
theorizo and exnerinnnt on a woman
whom, as you know, I Iovj. Well, it
won't do any harm tD her and it may
do her all possible good. To-morrow
morning I shall try to do thj work."
Then turning mora particularly to
Ilabershon, he continued: "Ed., you
and I both love Gracs Thorneycroft,
Now, in tho presence of Hirtly, here, I
want you to promise me that, whatever
the consequences of my operation, you
will care for Grace as long as sho lives.
and. if necessary, care for me. too." i
1 think neithor Ilabershon or myself
understood tho purport of theso words,
when tiny wero spoken, though their
meaning was clear enough later on.
However, Ilabershon gave the request
ed promise and we parted for the
nii-lit.
The next day, in the forenoon, Ram
say, in the presence of the two physi
cians who had been ia charge of Grace,
began his operations. I was. an inter
ested observer from a distant part of
the room, but Habcrihon could not be
induced to be present. Ramsay told
the older doctors that if his theory
proved perfectly successful in practice
he would be able to give his method of
cure in writing for tho benefit of the
medical world at present, ha said that
it was utterly impossible for him to in
telligently explain his idea. However,
he guaranteed that the attempt would
bo perfectly harmless to tho patient and
tho doctors stood by ready to pre
vent any undue or dangerous experi
ment. For myself, I have not the least
idea to this day just what the means

his life in which he proved that genius,
ho partially failed; and, in that by

The First Razor.
The earliest reference to shaving is
found in Genesis xii: 14, whure we icad
that Joseph, on being summoned before
the king shaved himself. Thero are
several directions as to s'aaving in
Levitticus, and the practice is alluded
to in many other parts of scripturo.
Egypt is the only country meitioned ia
the Bible where shaving was practiced.
In all other countries such nn act would
have been ignominious. Herolotus men
tions that the Egyptians allcwed their
beards to grow when in motrning. So
particular were thoTi5 -o shaving at
subject of reproach and ridicule, and
whenever they intended to convey the
idea of a man of low condition and
slovenly habits the artists represented
him with a beard. Unlike the Romans
of a later age, the Egyptians did
not confine the privilege of
shaving to free citizens, but obliged
their slaves to shave both beard acd
head. The priests also shaved the
head. Shaving the head became cus
tomary among tho Romans about 360 B.
C. According to Plinv, Scipio Afri-
canus was the first Roman who shaved
daily. In France the custom of shav
ing arose when Louis XIII. came to the
throne young and beardless. The
Anglo-Saxons wore their beard3 until,
at the conquest, they were compelled
to follow the example of tho Normans,
who shaved. From the time of Ed
ward in. to unaries l. beards were
universally worn. In Charles II.'s
reign the mustache and whiskers only
were worn, and soon after this the prac
tice of shaving became general through
out Europe. The revival of the custom
of wearing the beard dates from the time
of the Crimea, 1854-55. Penman's

elers requiring extraordinary means to

become wcll-nizh impassable to horses
for long periods, and thon the only
means of communication from farm
house to farm-house and hamlet to ham

sturdy Norseman binds upon his legs
his long fleet "ski" and flies easily and
gracefully over tho drifts and shoots
like lightning down the hills and steep
mount tin sides, and out of stern neces
sity has learned to draw a vigorous
amusement. The history of the "ski"
is the history of the wonderful people
who uso it as a Lir.hright. Norse
mythology is full of it, and some of the
most stirring pas;ages in Norwegian his
tory draw their romance from tho bold
and daring feats of hardy "ski" runners.
The "ski," pronounced softly and de
fiantly "sh"," familiar and dear to tho
runner as his sweetheart oftentiin?s, is a
long and narrow strip of wood, often
pine, better of hard wood, made with a
curling nose to override the snow, and
bearing near its centre a strap and rest

strength of tha runner and the pur
pose of the ".ski, " seldom exceeding
ten feet, however. For mountain and
denso forest traveling they are made
shorter and for military manoeuvres.
when worn by soldiers, are of unequal

Generally they present only the wood
en surface to the snow, but some
times, especially when designed for
travel where many hills are to be as
cended, their bottoms are covered with
deer hide, the hair pointing backward,
and acting as a secure anchor against
retrogression. They solve the problem
of walking on the snow on tho sime
principle as the more clumsy and
slower plaited snowshoe familiar in
American forests, by dividing the
weight of the wearer over a large sur
face. The American snowshoe is also
in U3e in Norway, but, as was remarked
Ly an expert runner, "it is too slow for
men, and we give it to old women and
put it on horses."
The feats of speed and dexterity per
formed on their "skis" by expert run
ners are wonderful. On a level surface
they move as fast as a good hone, but
it is coming down hill that they show
their mcttlo. Curving gracefully over
the crest, as the slopo grows steeper
they gather speed liko lightning, until,
with full headway, they shoot through
the air with the speed of a railroad
train, fairly taking away the breath of
the daring runner with tho rapid motion.
A well authenticated account is current
in Norway that one Finnish woman, a
very expert runner, ono day tried tho
descent of a peculiarly steep mountain
side, and attained such fearful speed
that when those who awaited her at the
end of her bird-like flight received her,
she stood bolt upright on her "skis,"
dead, the breath literally ravished from
her lip by her rapid descent The

games with tho "skis," a "hop" is gen
erally made by building up a cliff with

declivity, and this is made high accord

Then there we hundreds of circtHss,
big and uttle, and various side snows,
which patrolled tha country from ocean
to ocean. Out ia tha. wost, too, mny
of the small shows had gambling at
tachments, which helped materially to
rako ia the money. A proprietor of
one of these thought no'hing of paying
$1000 for any animal which happened
to strike his fancy.
"But many of these parties made
money so fast that they shortly closed
up business and quit. Then came tho
financial crash of 1873, and the fctagna
tioa of every kind of business, and the
failures of most of these circus and
showmen remaining. The i th? new
mi who came into the biuimss di I not

to buy large numbers of animals or very
valuable specimens. So it has been ever
since, with a consequent stagnation in

scarcity of certain kinds of wild ani

A Man With a Silver Hand.
Daniel Goodwin of Weymouth, Mass.,
has a German silver hand, and, not
withstanding the fact that there are no
fingers on it, ho is able to keep pace at
his trade that of carpentcring--with
those blessed with the customary num
ber of digits. An injury to Mr. Good
win's own hand necessitated its ampu
tation. It was not until he ha I invent
ed a substitute, which he hoped would
enable him to support himself and
family, that he would consent to have it
amputated. His scheme consists of a
socket, reaching half way to the elbow,
into which socket tho stump is placed,
and at the Other end of which a hole is
drilled with a thread cut. The con
trivance is a great success. Mr. Good
win has a surprisingly large number of
useful tools that fit into this tappod
hole, and he can drive nails all day wifh

Many lirds are fond of rice, but the
chief marsul?r is tha rlce-blrd" or
"bololink" of the totth. These winged
"anarchists" do not visit tha field by
scores or hundreds only, but by thou
sands and by innumerable multitude.
Sometimes whole fields are destroyed,
bringing to tho rice-planter a "crop of
discouragements" instead of a crop of
lice.
During ths time the rice-bird are so
numerous, hundreds of loyi and men
are employed, called "bird-niinder,"
who alarm tho bird by discharging fiie
arms, and in various way strive to keep
the birds from th(! field. Bird-trapping
and netting and egg
destroying are resorted to without
apparently diminishing the numbers,
ind with about as much visible benefit
is a fence might bo in keeping weeds
from a garden. In the "Annual Report
of Agriculture" it i stated that the
tnnual loss occasioned from bird
aggregates $2,000,000.
One largo rice-grower says: "We em

Petroleum as a Medicine.

been continued for too short a time, as,

fact that it dimmlshJs expectoration,
which also loses its purulent character.
The petroleum is popularly taken in
doses of a teaspoonful before each meal,
