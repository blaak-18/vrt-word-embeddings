J. A. Scarboro Writes Dr. Len Broughton
Dr. Len G. Broughton, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Brother:—ln the Georgian
of the 15th inst.. I note report of
your challenge to Brother Thos. E.
Watson, to discuss “the question at
issue concerning the Foreign Mis
sion question,” and his declination
for the reason that you are a preach
er and he is not.
I have also noted former chal
lenge to Mr. Watson, by a number
of Atlanta gentlemen, to meet Mr.
Ellis, of Philadelphia, on the same
subject, and the rather caustic criti
cisms of Mr. W atson, made from
time to time, both for his written
statements about methods in mis
sions, and his declination to meet
Mr. Ellis.
I have read all Mr. Watson has
written upon the subject, carefully;
and having been an interested stu
dent of mission methods for many
years, and had some part in oppos
ing the things connected with mis
sions. which Mr. Watson is now op
posing, both what he has written and
the effort to have the subject dis
cussed in Atlanta have been intense
ly interesting to me.
If I understand Mr. Watson—and
he has made himself quite clear —he
is not opposed to missions at all,
but what he does oppose is the ex
tra-Scriptural attachments, which he
has specified, now loaded on to the
missionary enterprise and the sup
porting churches, and not embraced
or contemplated in the Commission
as given by Christ in the New Testa
ment; as well as the ponderous and
expensive machinery in operation
and the innovations and departures
from New Testament democracy and
polity which have grown up in mis
sionary organizations.
And since your challenge is not
specific as to what phase of the
question you propose.,to discuss, and
since you say “the question at is
sue,'’ when there are several, it
seems to me that in order to in
telligently and profitably discuss
the proposition it should be specific,
setting out the precise question, or
questions, proposed for discussion.
If this can be done and straightfor
ward discussion can be had, either
in the press or on the rostrum, of
the issues involved, much good can
be accomplished, information given,
mistakes corrected, etc. And it is
my earnest desire to see this good
accomplished that induces me to
write you this letter and propose to
you, and any others who may wish
such discussion, that the proposi
tions be fully and fairly stated, and
then go before the public and
give the facts so necessary to an
intelligent decision.
And to this end I propose to you
a discussion of the following formu
lated propositions, which, I think,
fairly state the real issues involved:
1. Resolved, That the methods in
Mission work, now in operation in
the Southern Baptist Convention
and its auxiliary State and local
bodies, and all like organizations in
the various Christian denomina
tions, are Scriptural in plan or or
ganization, doctrine or teaching,
practice or method, and design or
purpose.
J. A. SCARBORO, Denies.
2. Resolved, That the Commission
given by Christ for the evangeliza-
tion of the whole world, embraces all
the things now used by missionary
organizations in connection with the
work of preaching and teaching the
Gospel, such as literary and scien
tific, industrial and technical educa
tion, benevolence or the care of the
poor in heathen lands, hospital
work, free medical service, medicine,
etc., and the erection of church
houses, hospitals, school-houses, and
any and all that appertains to edu
cation and civilization in the home
land.
—, Affirms.
J. A. SCARBORO, Denies.
These propositions embrace every
phase of the work, both as to organi
zation and doctrine, and economics
and practice.
If you have any objections to the
propositions as stated, I shall be
glad to co-operate with you in the
formulation of propositions which
we can agree do state the issues.
And now I respectfully challenge
you to a discussion of the issues
stated in the above propositions, or
such propositions as we may agree
do state the real issues in contro
versy, in Atlanta or any other place
south of Mason and Dixon’s line,
time, place and details to be agreed
upon.
If you will affirm above proposi
tions, or others clearly stating the

issues I will deny them,
and we will go to the public for a
verdict.
It has been my earnest desire and
effort for many years to get the facts
about these matters before the pub
lic. They are vital questions which
concern every man interested in
missions, and they are up for exami
nation not only in our owifland, but
throughout the Christian world and
on mission fields as well. The de
nominational press has suppressed
free discussion of these questions be
fore the people, and great and grave
injustice has been done to the cause
of truth and right by such suppres
sion. And I rejoice that this living
issue has forced itself on public at
tention despite the efforts of a par
tial and partisan denominational
journalism which has designedly
kept it from the public as long as it
possibly could.
It is to be regretted that those
who should thank Mr. Watson for
entering upon the discussion of a
subject of such tremendous import
and co-operating .with him in the
effort to have all the facts of the
present methods pursued given to
the public, should have exhibited
such a spirit of partisanship and
partiality as to lead them to adopt
methods and use language about
him which no Christian man should
use of another; and to deny to him
the right of reply in the religious
press when both his intelligence and
veracity were assailed in that press.
I am a Baptist, as you are. It is a
trophy claimed by Baptists, that they
have led the world in the advocacy
and defense of free speech and
press, and it is a matter for hufirilia
tion and sorrow for Baptists when
Baptist papers deny the right of free
press to their own brethren whom
they assail.
Assuring you of my respect and an
earftest desire that such discussion
may be had as will give the public
full information cm the issues involv
ed and so end in the amicable ad
justment of differences, the correc
tion of the errors so common to our
frail humanity, and lead to more
consecrated efforts for the accom
plishment of the will of God and the
salvation of lost men, I am
Yours for investigation,
