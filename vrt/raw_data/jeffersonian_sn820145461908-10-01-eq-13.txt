Os this book Mr. Watson says: “In
order that editors, speakers, lecturers,
and voters might have in the conven
ient storehouse of one volume all the
scattered information now contained
in many; and in order that they might
have a brief statement of the line of
argument which we adopt upon all es
sential issues, I have written this book.
I have endeavored to fill it to the brim
with facts, important facts, undisputed
facts. I have tried to make it an ar
mory from which reformers can draw
every weapon of offense and defense.”

THE AD MAN’S GALLEY.
' By James Lanier.
Ixere is the verdict of one of our
advertisers: “We consider your
Weekly Jeffersonian the best advertis
ing medium in the South. We
received over two hundred answers
from our advertisement in the past
two weeks, and still they come.”
That was from Miller’s Young Amer
ican Directory.
The President of Locust Grove In
stitute writes: “We are well pleased
the results of oilr (advertising
with you, and you may count on us
for a larger ad next season.”
Wessels, the mail order man, says:
I received better returns from mv
two-inch ad with the AVeekly Jeffer
sonian than from any other of the one
hundred Southern publications in
which I used the same space.”
A word about our premiums. We
have five agents now working for the
dictionary, one for the dinner set, sev
eral for Bibles, one for the fountain
pen, one for a mission lamp.
The offering of such valuable prem
iums marks a new departure for the
Jeffersonians. We have always given
nandsome commissions to out agents.
One agent, the other day, made $12.75
in a few hours’ work. But some peo
ple don’t care to accept cash commis
sions, and as we do not wish anyone
to 'work for us without compensation,
we are offering these premiums. They
are all of solid value. You can’t go
out and buy the Imperial Dictionary
for less than ten dollars. The set of
silver plated cutlery will cost you
fifteen dollars if you buy it at a
store; but you can get it by securing
15 subscribers to the Weekly, or 20 to
the Magazine. Two or three days’
work among your friends, and you
can get a handsome dinner or break
fast set of semi-porcelain plates and
dishes, some valuable books, a fine
clock, the set- of 26 pieces of Rogers’
silver-plated cutlery, the best cook
book in the world, or a razor, or a
fountain pen, or a Student’s Bible
or a big Family Bible, or many other
articles of household use.
Every now and then a letter comes
along and says: “Please change Bill
Smith’s address to Goshen, Idaho,”
or some other place. We have to sit
down and write to him.: “Mr. Bill
Smith: Are you a subscriber to th’e
Weekly or the Magazine, and what
was your former address before you
moved to Goshen, Idaho?” Before
we get a reply a week or ten days
have passed by, and Mr. Bill Smith
wonders why he doesn’t get his paper
at his new address, and says uncom
plimentary things about the circula
tion department of the Jeffersonians.
Have you any idea about the mail
ing list of a magazine or a weekly
paper? Do you know what it is?
When we receive a subscription let
ter, it is handled first by the cashier,
who marks upon it the amount of
money enclosed. Then it passes to
another clerk, who gives it a serial
number and typewrites the name, ad
dress and date of expiration on a
card. These subscription cards, after
they have been carefully checked with
the original letter, go to the mailing
list entry clerk, who writes each new
name in its proper place on the list,
and changes the date of expiration in
'Jeffersonian
the case of renewals. The cards are
then filed in cabinets, strictly in al
phabetical order by states, by post
offices and by surnames of the sub
scribers. Each card boars the num
ber of_ the subscription.
Suppose a complaint comes in that
John Jones, at Smithtown, Alabama,
is not receiving his paper. The com
plaint clerk takes the letter, goes to
the filing cabinet, and pulls out the
da we r which has the A1 aba m a cards.
He runs through the cards, Abbe
ville, Andalusia, Anniston, Binning
ham, until he comes to Smithtown.
Then he looks through the cards for
the Smithtown subscribers until he
comes to John Jones. That card is
numbered 27015. Back the clerk goes
to the files of subscription letters,
which are all in numerical order, finds
number 27015, and compares the in
structions in the letter with the entry
on the mailing list. Perhaps he finds
that a rural route has been omitted;
or that the printer, in setting up the
mailing list, has made an error; or
perhaps John Jones himself, in send
ing in his subscription, did not write
his name plainly, or gave the wrong
address. The entry is corrected, Mr.
Jones advised by postal card, and the
clerk goes on to the next complaint.
Now, as to the mailing list. At the
printing office in Atlanta- it may be
seen in the form of solid rows of
type, lying in brass galleys, one above
the other. It is in strictly alphabeti
cal order. First comes the heading
of tlie first state, in big letters, ALA
BAMA. Then follows the first town
in Alabama—say Abbeville. Then the
first subscriber in Abbeville, who is.
“Anderson, J. M., Rte. 1, Jan. 15,
09.” His name is followed'by the
names of all the other subscribers at
Abbeville, alphabetically arranged.
The next town is Alexandria, and so
on, all through the state of Alabama,
until you come to the state of Ar
kansas, with another long list of
towns and the subscribers in each.
Here in the office we handle, not
the tons of metal, but proofs of the
list, which are taken by a “devil”
using an ink roller, some sheets of
dampened paper and another metal
roller to pass over the rows of type
in the galleys.
To come back to Mr. Bill Smith,
of Goshen, Idaho. He has moved to
Goshen, but from what town? His
name is one of 20,000 on the mailing
list. He may have moved from Illi
nois or New York or Georgia. We
cannot hunt through 20,000 names —
a week’s work—so we must write to
Mr. Bill Smith for his former address.
At last, after about two weeks, for
Bill lives on a rural route and gets
his mail once a week, we find out that
he came to Idaho from some little
town in California. Bill can’t under
stand why his name is not quite fa
miliar to us, and why we couldn’t find
it on our little mailing list. Perhaps,
if he reads this, he will understand
better.
Next week we will recommend that
a law be passed by the legislature,
making it a felony for a man to sign
his name illegibly. Os course, some
fellow, with a signature like a flash
light picture of a drop of grease in a
hot skillet, will object, but wait until
we get through with him.
