why can we not accomplish anything
if we just have these three graces?
If the love of God reigned supremely
in our hearts and we have Faith and
Hope, the heathen would become
Christians through the power of God
and establish and maintain their own
schools and churches, and we should
have more money and more Gospel
spirit for our own illiterate children.
Though we may give all our goods to
feed the poor and our bodies to be
burned and have not charity, it
profiteth us nothing.
In all of your publications since
the first of January on Foreign Mis
sions I have not seen but one logical
argument, viz., the letter from the
Philippines.
I was hoping to see your reply, but
am disappointed to the present time.

A LETTER FROM NORTH GEOR
GIA.
Dear Sir: —I am a new subscriber
to The Jeffersonian and like it fine,
and my reason for liking The Jeff, is
it deals in facts. We have some mis
sionary cranks in old North Georgia;
they preach from the pulpit, borrow
money and pay interest on it to send
to foreign lands. Did you ever hear
of such ? And the people who rent
land barely have decent clothing to
go to iiear the Gospel preached. Nine
tenths of us haven’t decent houses to
live in. I will give you a short de
scription of the houses we live in:
you can almost stick your fingers
through the floor; not ceiled, and
some with no loft. If you ask the
land owner for a load of lumber to
repair your house with he will grum
ble “I am not able,” but this same
man will give his money to buy the
burr-heads of some other nation fine
homes to live. in. “He that will not
provide for his own household is
worse than an infidel.” Whose house
are you keeping in order? I hope
every reader of The Jeffersonia will
think over this matter seriously, for
it is sapping the very life blood out
of us. Success to the Jeffs and its
many readers.
Yours in the work,
Dewey Rose, Ga. W. G. BOOTH.
Comment.
It is certainly most encouraging to
witness the gradual awakening that
is going on among our common peo
ple. It is a perfect outrage that the
Foreign Mission Boards, and the edi
tors who dip their fingers into mis
sionary money, should keep up this
eternal asking for more coin to sup
port the unscriptural work in foreign
countries.
As Mr. Booth says, the very people
who live in uncomfortable houses
hardly worthy of the name of a
dwelling, and whose w’ives and chil
dren have to do the housework, (and
sometimes the field work,) never
having any too much in the way of
bedding, clothing, food and furni
ture, should be evelastingly preached
at, prayed at and sung at, to get their
money to carry off to China to sup
port THE FOREIGN MISSIONARIES
in’ther LUXURIOUS LIVING.
Very few people in this country
can afford to live in the elegant
houses and the elegant style kept up
by our foreign missionaries. Beauti
ful city residences for the winter,
beautiful mountain homes for the
summer; elegant furniture, elegant
clothing, sumptuous food, servants
to wait on them, servants to attend
them while travelling, an easy time
and a regular salary: such is the life
of the foreign missionary.
Even now, this Japanese gentle
man, whom they call “Prine” Yun, is
going around, taking up collections
to build another $20,000 college in
Korea. Yet, as our older subscribers*':
vividly remember, that when I first"'
began to preach on this outrageous
system, such papers as The Wesleyan
Christian Advocate, and such minis
ters of the Gospel as Scoville and
Towson, violently denied my charges
and claimed that the missionary
schools, colleges, hospitals, etc., were
self-supporting, or nearly so. As a
matter of fact, they are not self-sup
porting, nor nearly so; they are now
increasingly heavy taxes upon the
common people of this country, who
ought to rise up in indignation and
demand that these Boards be abol
ished, THAT MAGAZINES AND MIS
SIONARY PAPERS CEASE TO
FEED UPON THE MISSIONARY
COLLECTIONS TAKEN UP IN THE
CHURCHES; and that the foreign
missionaries dismiss their servants,
and get down to apostolic simplicity
in the doing of their work.
The work itself should be limited
to the preaching of Christ and Him
cricified. That is all that Paul did:
all that the brother of our Lord did:
all that Peter did: all that Christ
did; all that Christianity did for the
first eighteen hundred years of its ex
istence of this earth. T. E. W.
“SIX HEATHEN FOR A QUARTER.”
. Dear Sir: —When I read in the At
lanta Journal Col. Bill Howard’s let
ter, I said to my better 3-4, as “Si
Otis” would express it, Bill has hit
Tom below the belt, and I shall look
for The Jeffersonian to wipe up the
earth with William, and I am not
disappointed. Several years ago I
advised the boys to be careful how
they tackled “Lttle Tom.” Some
held up, and others kept on, only to
be annihilated. Colonel, I am near
ing my 72d milestone, and many
times do I wonder who will defend
the wool-hat boys and poor people
when you shall have been gathered
to the fathers. In the course of na
ture, I will not be here, being older
than you. But who will be the
Moses to lead the people when you
are gone? No man has done more
for the common people than you. I
subscribed for your paper on the day
you spoke in Cuthbert, in 1 8 93, and
have kept up with you down to the
present time. Colonel, we have all
the poor right here at our own doors
to take all the Home Mission money
that we can get. Right here at home
is where all that I have given has
gone, with the single exception of 25
cents. The preacher said a nickle
would save one heathen, so I told
him to take the quarter, as that
w r ould save six. My heart will be
with you wherever you may be.
Your true friend to the end,
T. A. McWILLIAMS.

Dear Sir: —I am sending under
separate cover a copy of Zion’s Ad
vocate, one of our denominational
papers, in which you will note a short
editorial on first page relative to Mr.
Watson’s book. I would be pleased
if you would show this note to Mr.
Watson, for I want him to know that,
personally, I shall do what I can to
circulate his book on this question,
and that I believe our people all over
the United States stand with him on
the position he has taken, as I un
derstand it, viz.: that the Gospel
should be preached,—that the field
should support the preacher,—that
in preaching the truth as it is in
Christ Jesus, and adorning that truth
with a godly walk and conversation,
we have fulfilled the commission.
I also want to say that I greatly
enjoy Watson’s Magazine. May God
•tenable him to turn the light on
{ Catholisism as he has on the Mission
question and Socialism. I may send
Jeffersonian
in my subscription for The Jefferson
ian soon. May also send in some
subscribers ere long.
Yours truly,

Comment.
The above is most highly appre
ciated. I am a Missionary Baptist;
but not a crazy one. Consequently,
I don’t believe that the words
“preach” and “teach,” as used in the
Bible, mean “collections”, more col
lections, and then some more, to get
money to “redeem” our dear little
Dora, buy gold leaf for rotten teeth,
or free drug stores, doctors, surgeons
and nurses; nor experts to teach
gymnastics, music, literature, farm
ing, blacksmithing and house-build
ing; nor luxurious living in China,
where at least three servants are
necessary to win the respect of rich
Chinese. T. E. W.
A FLORIDA PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l have seen
some copies of your Magazine, and
am now a subscriber. I wish all my
missionary friends here could read
your article on Foreign Missions.
The abuses carried on by the mod
ern mission system results from the
fact that the institution itself is of
carnal and not of Divine origin.
If the apostles had not been in
vested with “power from on high”
their ministrations would have been
barren of good results. Moreover, if
Jesus had not been with them, by His
Spirit, the efforts would have been
vain.
The modern system is entirely
wanting in Divine power, and, there
fore, has to rely-on money, not only
for the making of “proselytes,” but
for the subsistence of the mission
aides themselves. The distinction is

the same as the distinction between

You will doubtless locate me as a
“Hardshell.” Certainly I am, and a
red-headed one at that. I have al
ways believed that if God wanted
anybody to preach to the “heathen”
He was able to call one to preach to
them in their own tongue. But no
“Hardshell” objects to any one w’ho
knows the truth and is regularly in
vested with proper authority.
While the Primitive Baptist min

still doing so, it is without dissimu-
