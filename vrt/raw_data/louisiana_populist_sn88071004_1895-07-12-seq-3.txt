simply irresisti!,le.
Near the stan' stI' I several I ar
" rel of ice water which most ef
fet'ally slaked the th hirst of every
dry mortal on the .iroiund that day,:.
:lnl kept the peace('' (a well, for we
hehlieve that had hott',s and juirs
of ir\ew\later taken the place (of
- those blarrels of ice water, a regi
1 unent of special marshals would
have ieen necessary, while as it
was, we never heard of a mlarshal
_ during the (lay.
But the speakers stand was what
took our eye. The planks were
laid from axle to axle on a huge
lot-wagon that stood convenient,
and a light railing with a sent on
one side made a rostrum more con
venient than that from which Tal
mage delivers his weekly discours
es, because it was on wheels. W.
D S. Morgan says the People's party
is religion in motion, and now that
3 it has got on wheels we expect to
see the world christianized.
Pronmptly at 11 o'clock Mr. W.
i F. Eversul, Chairman of the local
t club, called the meeting to order,
- and called upon Rev. I. M. Brian,
of Boyce, to lead in prayer, which
he did very eloquently.
Mr. Jas. O. Mayhen, of Alpha,
was then called to the chair, and
introduced lion. J. W. Jones, of
Natchitoches. Mr. Jones spoke
very entertainingly of the history
. and purposes of the People's party,
for about 40 minutes. He was fol
t lowed bjy this quill driver, who
spoke on pretty much the same
subject for one hour and 40 min
utes. Hon. B. W. Bailey, of
Winn, was next introduced as the
orator of the day, and for one hour
t and 25 minutes he discussed the
a principles of our party as against
a those of the old parties, interspers
hing here and there with good sto
"ries and witticisms. His speech
was well received, and as the au
dienoe had been held for about 4
hours, they did not need a second
invitation to dinner.
We ahall not attempt to describe
the dmner, as we have commented
on the "fare" in that community
before, and this was far ahead of
I anything we had previously tack
a led. We must say however, that
I besides the barbecued meats, which
were as he as we ever saw, there
were cakes sad pies and custards
aId dumpings, and paddings and
Ssauces and gravies and pickles and
m alads and deserts and sweet
B meate ad cooklies, and-anything
*eleyearcan think of good to eat.
Verly, the ward 9 Pepblit club
doe't do things by halves, and we
hope eve~ry member of that elub as
. well ma their pretty goodlooskng
wives and d·agbters, ej-ed them
