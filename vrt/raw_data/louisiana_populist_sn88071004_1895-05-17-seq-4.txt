TO COTTON GF:OWERS AND
GIN NERS.
The Galveston Maritime AssoOlation-To
Farmers, Glnners, Cotton Shippers.
Carriers, Manuftcturers of tagging
and the General Public Interested in
the Better Handling of Cotton.
GALVESTON, Tex., April 15, 1Sl3.
Considering the numerous and undoubt
edly well merited complaints being niadeat
the Mill Points regard:nr; the enormous
loss in weight sustained oil Texas Cotton,
and the wretched condition generally in
which it is received, it is itulsrative that
all parties interwcted in the chief product
of our state should take concentrated ac
tion to rectify the causes attributable
thereto, which are as follows:
The lack of uniformity in the size of the
bales; the insufficient quantity and
strength of the bagging used to adequately
protect the Cotton and retain distinguish
able marks; and the want of the proler
number of strong ties to prevent the bales
from bursting.
Therefore, in order to bring about much
needed reforms in the handling of Cotton
from the time it is ginned until delivered
at the Mills, so it may bring the
highest price to which it is
with due care, entitled, we baJ to call your
attention to the following ruYes adopted by
the New Orleans Maritime Convention,
now promulgated by this Association,
composed of the various Ship Agents at
the Port of Galveston, which will take
effect August 1st, 1'Ji5, viz:
1. All ocean freight quotations will be
based upon a compressed density of twen
ty-five pounds of Cotton per cubic foot,
when delivered alongside the vessel.
2. The size of a standard bale of Cotton,
as put up at the gins, shall be as follows
2'8 inches Loxed width and 55 inches boxed
length.
3. All Cotton shall be covered entirely
with bagging weighing not less than V'i
pounds per running yard, and bound with
eight good iron or steel ties.
4. All bales of larger dimensions and
covered with bagging of less weight or
bound with less number of ties, will be
charged with additional ocean freight, or
rejected as being in unmerchantable condi
tion for ocean carrying. Yours very truly,
DAS'I. RPLvT, President.
The Interior Compress association, at a I
meeting held at Dallas April 25, 1805, s
adopted the following:
Resolved, that we urge farmers and gin
ners of cotton to use no bagging lighter t
than 2,j pounds per yard, and, also to 1
change their press boxes to conform to the t
standard fixed by the Maritime association
of New Orleans and Galveston, and thus
save an expense of not less than one dol'ar e
per bale, which will be taxed at the ports s
against the cotton because of its unmer- o
chantable condition. d

)8 The famous dismal swamp, of Vi

v., state. for U10. '00-a good deal of
i- ground and water for thoe money. If
as the farmer is energetic, the Brookl n

and make a good deal besides, for the
swamp is not all swamp, by any
means. Originaily the swamp was a

le the stagnant ooze or falline. exhausted
with hunger and travel, amid en
tangling vegetation that shut out the
sight of the sky that overhung the
land of liberty.
By the digging of the canal some of
, the ponded waters of the swamp were
;. drained and when a railroad was car
ried through it was followed by the
o 'making" of nov ground on which to
t plant stations, mills for cutting fuel for
d the locomotives, cabins for the men em
ployed in the maintenance of the road
and '-ruck" gardens for small farm
ers who supply the men. These
patches of good ground have spread
ro and grown until there is something of
a permanent population in the swamp
' and capacity for more. A northern
man who went there to settle would
probably require a few pounds of
quinine pills and would always look
around the floor before he went to bed
- to make sure that the servant had put
tt the rattlesnakes and moccasins out for
1l the night; but people inured to the
climate and conditions perhaps
t through generations, seem to thrive
t as well there as others do on dry
plains and salubrious hills.

claims for the return of money paid for it were
exceedingly rare. Since its manufacturers can
now point to thousands of noted cures effected
