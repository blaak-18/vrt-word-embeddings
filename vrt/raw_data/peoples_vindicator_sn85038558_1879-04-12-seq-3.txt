Bine Ball.
At a meeting bold last Thursday night I
at the City Hall, a base ball club was or. t
ganized by electing A. D. D. Wright, pree- m
ident, and Jam. T. Sprowl, seeretary. t
With thispair of roosters at the head, a
the businaes of electing the other officers ,
and selecting the nine was a matter of a
comparative ease. Mr. W. H. Ware, t
was chosen to look after the money as
triasurer (in our opinion he will have t
a nice time finding any). "Allwrights"
was the ammo selected fqr the club. Mr. ,
Joseph Kile, was chosen as field captain. e
Last Wednesday night eome of Nateh
toches' best material, noted in partie
lar for their personal beauty sad their
proficiency in never refusing to take "a
-mile" when asked, met at the City Hall i
and organized a base ball club an
der the name of the "Aeme,". The fol
lowing were elected oMeers: A. H. Le
comte, president; G. W. Kile, vice-preesi.
