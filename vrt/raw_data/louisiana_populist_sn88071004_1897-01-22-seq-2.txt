FRIDAY, January 22, 1897.
True to his promise Capt. Pharr
and his generous neighbors have
sent a car load of 36 barrels of
sugar and 45 barrels of molasses
to the drouth sufferers of Cald
well and Ouachita parishes. He
will also semd a carload of the mo
lasses to Winn parish.

The relief committees of wards
2, 3 and 4 met here last Friday
evening and together with the
Parish committee apportioned the
supplies furnished by the State
and passed upon the individual ap
plications from said wards.
There were 3:30 familits in ward
2 that applied for relihef of which
228 were allowed, 120 from ward
3 of which 100 were allowed and
40 from ward 4 which were al
lowed.
8000 pounds of bacon and near
ly 4400 bushels of corn was
the amount of State relief sent in,
was divided as, follows: Ward
4, 500 bushels of corn and 1000
pounds of bacon, ward 3 1000
bushels of corn and 1750 pounds
of bacon, and ward 2 the balance
which is nearly 2900) bushels of
corn and about 5250 pounds of
bacon.
As will he seen -many applicants
for relief who are really sufferers
and deserving of help were cut
off because of a lack of sufficient
provisions to supply all cases,
hence only the most destitute were
allowed.
These rations will last about 2
months, and by that time all the
applications which were rejected
will be destitute, so that there will
be over 500 families in the 3 wards
that will need help.
The last appropriation of $1000
from the parish is entirely for
the wards west of led River
and will furnish about the
same amount of help the State fur
nishes for the others as detailed
above.
Meanwhile the other branch of
relief, the furnish of cheap corn
and almost free freight under the
Freeman committee, goes bravely
on and is outstripping all the rest.
Mr. Freeman. Chairman of the
committee, has now ordered 23
car loads of corn, or 13800. bush
els, of which 6 cars will be left at
Marthaville, 2 at Robeline, 4 at
Provencal, 1 at Derry, 3 here and
7 at Grand Ecore for wards 2, 3
and 4.
But none of these supplies have
been distributed as yet to the act
ual consumers, the first cars of
the State relief are just now ar
riving at the Natchitoches depot,
and the railroad having washed
out between here and Grand
Ecore, it is becoming a serious
question how the people of ward
2, 3 and 4 are going to get the 18
or 20 carloads of stuff. The ones
who need it worst will be the least
able to cdme to Natehitoches after
it, paying, from ward 2, two fer
riage. But Cane River is rapid
ly rising and Mr. Freeman kindly
offers the use of the H. W. Graves
to take stuff here at the depot and
put it down in Campte if the bene
ficiaries will furnish the wood and
labor. This will save ferriage at
Grand Ecore and an 8 mile haul
over abad road and should be
taken ad4vantage of by all means.
The crew of the Three Friends
who shot back when attacked by
8paniards, are to be tried for pira
cy. They are guilty of the same
offence that Lafayelte, Pulaski,
Koseinsko, Baron Stuben and oth
er heroes who helped us in our
/ghrious strugglo for freedom in

ATLANTA, LA., Jan. 13, 18t:7.
Mr. II. L. Brian :
Dear Sir-At a ward ,ni:.;s ne .t
ing held at Atlant. on the 18lth
inst., the indersi:.nld wv p
poiinted ai eiuiitte.e to ,"k or alid:
to relieve the dr~uth.il su ci'cr:; of I
this ward. There is at this tIl!e
about seventy families in this ward
that are without corn, and probla
bly more than that number thll: arMe
without meat, to say lothing of
clothes and the starving lstock.
And they have neither money nor
credit, and as a matter of course,
they will have to abandon their
homes and go to where they can
get something to sustain life if
they do not get some help very
soon.
Now that kind Providence has
frowned upon them and the land
failed to bring forth her fruit, all;
credit has been stopped, and the
starving people leave their homes
in search of bread. Men with
their wives and their starving, cry
ing children dragging after themn
in search of bread. Can this be
so? No,, we cannot think it can
,be so. But relief must come, and
come soon, or the above will be
c'ery word true. And we ask
you to use all your influence for
us. It has been thought and said
that there had been some exagera
tion about the suffering of the peo
ple. This is not true, but it is the
reverse, the real condition of the
country in the (drouth stricken dis,
trict is just beginning to be really
known, as there were a great nun
ny farmers that gathered a little
corn which they have lived upon,
and some have divided with their
more unfortunate neighbor, until
there is no more to d(ivide. And
there being no mast, there is of
course, no meat, anti no syrup,
and the range being ruined by the
drouth, cattle is very poor,. and
consequently but little milk and
butter, so we are forced to ask for
I lp from any source that we can
get it.
