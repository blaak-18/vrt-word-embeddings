coats to get out of the way of Wat
son’s double-barreled Jeffersonians,
it gives me that feeling I used to
have “way down in Georgia,” when
old “Trailer” was pulling hair out
of the tail of ‘Bre’r Fox,” and I
just stood up in the stirrups and
yelled until I was hoarse with de
light! “Sic ’em Tom!” You are
God’s own good dog! And I would
rather be God’s good dog, with my
paws full’ of thorns chasing the foxes
of evil, than the devil’s correspond
ing secretary on a big salary, run up
a tree by the Lord’s hunting dogs!
Fidelity to God and humanity is the
crowning glory of earthly existence
and attainment! History and desti
ny will crown you victor!

THAT FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.
Editor Jeffersonians: — Your paper,
this week, is unusually good. Press
your attack upon the vile Fifteenth
Amendment. We’ll write our rep
resentatives in the Legislature.
Here is “Marching Through Geor
gia” Revised, which you may pub
lish if you think it is worth publish
ing.
With best wishes, I am,
Yours truly
(Rev.) S. GRADY.

MIGHTY HARD TO PLEASE ’EM
ALL IN ALABAMA JUST NOW.
Dear Sir: — The Jeffersonian failed
to show up at my postoffice last
week, and I felt very much disap
pointed, as I prize your periodicals
above any of my papers.
Your letter of twenty-fifth- to hand
and noted with interest. And I wish
to assure you that I had no such
thought as that you were an extrem
ist; on the other hand, have always
considered you one of the most tem
perate men we have. In fact, I have
looked and still look upon you as
being a true Democrat, in the full
meaning of the word. The only cause
of my writing you as I did, w’as that
in your last editorial you wrote in
favor of the amendment, and as the
most of the real temperate people in
this State are opposing the measure,
and 1 believing you to be strictly a
temperate prohibitionist, thought
you might have been laboring under
a mistaken idea. The greatest cause
of the bitter fight here is brought
about by the wording of the second
section of the proposed amendment
to the Alabama Constitution. There
is no telling what sort of a law
might be put upon us if the Legisla
ture were given the power that the
adoption of that amendment would
give.
Under our present Constitution,
our homes are protected, and we
temperate people, both prohibition
ists and antis, are opposed to tam
pering with such right. We can’t
tell what kind of a Legislature we
may have in the future. We may
have another extreme one, as it will
be in the power of Governor Comer
to call the Legislature in extra ses
sion again, and pass a law prohibit
ing the keeping of intoxicants even
in our own private homes, if such
amendment is carried. Any way, we
are afraid to risk them. We think
the prohibition laws are stringent
enough.
I am a subscriber to both your
papers and have enjoyed very much
your scrap with the parsons, and also
the Socialists. Hope you may live
long to carry on the good work of
reform.
Your friend,
J. F. McGINTY.

“ALL BOSH,” HE SAYS.
I see my time is up for The Jeffer
sonian; you will find postoffice mon
ey order enclosed for one dollar for
my renewal. You will please send
your premium knife. I have voted
for you every time you have been a
candidate. As the Populist party is
dead here, I will vote with the So
cialists hereafter. Done quit the
Demo-Republican parties long ago.
As for the Socialists being free lov
ers, nigger equality, that is all bosh.
I am personally acquainted with
many in my own State and Oklaho
ma and New Mexico, and higher
toned people are not to be found any
where.
I am with you on the missionary
fight. Christianize our own house
first. Texas needs a good dose of
mission work with the rest of the
States.
Yours truly,
J. L. KEETEN.

Answer.
Now, I like a man of this sort.
He differs from me, and yet he keeps
on taking the paper. He doesn’t
want the worms to devour me alive,
because we differ.
I hope to have the pleasure of
shaking his manly hand, some day.
In the meanwhile, just read the
Magazine articles on Socialism, and
peruse the weekly, attentively. If
I don’t prove every word that has
been said by me against Socialism,
I will never tackle another subject.
Nobody doubts that many fine peo
ple are Socialists. In fact, the party,
at the top, is composed of idealists
who believe in human’ perfectibility.
These are beautiful characters, but
utterly impracticable. Human na
ture does not admit of an earthly
Paradise, such as they dream of.
On the other hand, the Socialist
party, at bottom, is made up of des
titute men who want an equal share
in the wealth which their hungry
eyes see on every side of them.
In the middle, the Socialist party
is composed of the discontented, who
have been made to believe that So
cialism is about the same as Popu
lism.
Just keep on reading The Jeffer
sonian, Brother Keeten. Sit quietly
in the jury-box. It is my business
to show you, and I will.

NOVEMBER MAGAZINE WAS DE
LAYED, BUT IT IS OUT, NOW.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I have not re
ceived my Magazine for November.
I can not do without it at this time,
on account of the articles on Social
ism, which I consider the very ablest.
I have lived with Socialists in the
West, and you are lifting the mask
off Socialism in fine shape, as I think
I know to be true, from having asso
ciated with them to a limited extent.
Could you be mistaken as to for-
Dl?e Jeffersonian
eign missions? Well, yes; or any
other man, as for that matter, but to
a man up a tree, it looks like the love
of loot is the mainspring of foreign
missionary fanaticism.
I have never given one copper to
foreign missions since 1895, when
the missionaries listed their property
at many times its value with the
United States Government, and took
about one-third the amount so
claimed. The property in question
was supposed to have been destroyed
in the Boxer uprising in China. That
was the straw which broke the cam
el’s back.
I vote for you, and have been do
ing so at every opportunity, and have
seen no cause to regret it so far.
Tn short, I am with you.
Your admirer,
W. A. KEENER.

BULLY FOR THIS TEXAS BOY!
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
your weekly Jeffersonian for about a
year. It is one paper among many.
It is not like the common herd of
newspapers, with their adverse sug
gestion.
I am not old enough to vote, and
don’t know which ticket I will vote
when old enough. The Republican
and Democratic parties remind me
of two race-horses. They were both
all right in their day and time, but
their owners keep them too fat nowa
days. They win simply because the
colts are still too young. (Reform
parties.)
I believe that the United States is
getting like the Spartans said of the
Athenians:: “We always appoint, or
elect, our best men for president and
governors, and our best men are in
variably thieves.”
In regard to socialism: I believe
that the Socialistic “Free Love” doc
trine in practice would tend to make
the whole world “one vast house of
prostitution!” I would just like to
tell you one man’s idea of Socialism:
Jim B is an acknowledged So-
cialist. One day I said, “Jim, you
know some men are capable of work
ing better mentally than physically.
How about the mental workers?
Would they be paid just for sitting
up and thinking all day?” After I
explained what mentally and phys
ically meant, he said: “Well, I
guess so; provided they didn’t think
o’ no foolishness.”
Al Hopkins, a preacher and Social
ist speaker, came over from Okla
homa one day and after a series of
speeches, organized a club here. He
told us to use ballots and not bullets.
But from what I could make of his
talk, if ballots were not effective —
well, bullets didn’t belong to the old
stone age. You see, Brother Al
preached during the summer and
talked Socialism during the winter
(for his health, I suppose).
To jump the subject, but there’s
an article entitled “The Plunderers
of Washington” in Pearson’s last Is
sue, which I wish you would com
ment on. Especially upon the pur
chase of that part of the District of
Columbia which was ceded back to
Virginia. •
My uncle tells me that here, in
Sherman, beer sells for twenty cents
per bottle in order that the officials
can obtain the extra five cents. If
any saloon sells cheaper, he Is
promptly shut down, because it takes
the trade away from the saloon*
that pay the five cents toll (bribe).
Respectfully yburs,
JOE B. THORN.

FROM ONE WHO LOVES JUSTICE.
Sir:—At the last National Con
vention of Rural Letter Carriers, a
letter was read from you, and the
undersigned moved that the secreta
ry be instructed to write you and
say that we regarded you as the
father of rural delivery. If you have
not heard from our national secre
tary, Mr. P. E. Cull, of Concord,
Mass., let me know and I will jog
his memory. You will find the pro
ceedings I mention reported on page
526 of the R. F. D. News.
I don’t care a continental what
your politics are or where you hail
from, I want you to have your just
dues, and I believe you secured the
first money and perhaps started this
thing a quarter of a century ahead
of others.
Very respectfully,
R. F. D. CARRIER.
Ed. Comment: Have not yet heard
from Secretary Cull.
T. E. W.
YES! THEY ADMIT NEGROES.
Please tell us, some time, through
the weekly if the Chicago University
admits negro students, and if so,
are they in classes with the whites?
READER.
Answer.
My secretary, who is a Virginia
lady, tells me that some of her girl
friends .attended this Chicago Uni
versity, and they told her of the ne
gro girls who were in the same
classes with white girls. It is a so
cial equality college, similar to the
University of Nebraska, in which Mr.
Bryan educated his daughters.
T. E. W.
THEY WOULD ALL COME IF THEY
WOULD READ.
Mr. Watson: —I am doing much
for your publications, but I am work
ing for the cause. I heard a gentle
man say the other day that he used
to be a Democrat, but he had to quit
that party to be one; said he had
read all your articles on Foreign
Missions and had bought and dis
tributed a number of Magazines.
Wishing you much success,
Your friend,
MRS. BEULAH JOHNSTON.
October 18, 1909.
Resolved by Enterprise Local
