Protest and Remonstrance.
I ew Orleans, Sept. 17.-Gov. Mc
Enery held a couneil at the 8tate
house which, after a long consulta
tion and discussion, determined upon
the following letter to be addressed to
GeneralEmory, embodying the pro
test and rem6ustrance against the po
siation asnmed by him in the private
intirview, held with him last evening:
General W..- emory, commanding the De
Sp~atmmet of the Guif, Jew Orleans:
.general: We have the honor to
sibmit that since our interview last
ulight we have carefully considered
thfisaubject, therein formally discussed
and have concluded to address you in
writing Drotesting that there does not
exist in the State of Louisiana any in
stui'rectio against the government of
MeEnery; that there is not in any
part ofthe State of Louisiana any as
sembling or aggregation ofinsurgents
to disperse, and that the people of
L6uisiana are now peaceably at their
respective abodes and quietly pursu
log their usual avooationS, under the
protection of the law , that there is
notrace or vestige remaining of the
late asurpation, of which Wm. Pitt
Keloggwas the head that there is
but one government in existence 'in
ther8tate of Louisiana, .which is thm
government elected and chosen by
the people in November, 1872, and
legally installed in 187'3, of whichl
John MEnery is Governor and D B.
Penn, Lieutenant Governor; that mi
all the parishes and th ?pgnut the
4tate of Louisiana this government is
recognized and is supported and ad
hered to and respected and obeyed
by the people, and is both de jruc rnd
dee tieto, and the government of the
State of Louisiana in possession and
in the actual exercise of all govern
ment.al functions. That if we are
colmpelled by the military force of the
united States, which we have neither
tl.. lower nor the inclination to re
:i.;t, to retire from and to abandon the
c:.ie.rmenital pover and authority
º,,ah:,tiy arind in fact vested in us,
iu., or respective capacities, there is
no government of the State which can
take our place, and that it will be
necessary, in some form and by some
inttranentality, to infuse life into the
effectually dead and extinct usurping
governmentt, of which W, P. Kellogg
wa:i the head and chief, under the as
stmed title of Governor. Never the
less, having been;infornmed by you
that no alternative was left to us but
to conply immediately with the pro
clarnat;<:n of the President of date of
the 15th of September, 1874, or sub.
ject ourselves and our people to the
actual exercise of the military force,
which means war on the part of the
rgo;ernment against a State and the
people of a State, exhibiting no arm
ed4 opposition 'nd no hostility to the
United States.
We respectfully invite your atten
tiou to the law and the terms of the
iroc:lamatiou of the President. Ily
article IV of the constitution of the
United States, it is declared the
United States, shall, on application of
the legislature, etc., or the executive,
etc., protect each State againstdomes
tic violence. A part of the author
ity which this article imposed on the
United States, which means if neces
sary the entire gove"rnmncnt, was iam
posed upon the President as the head
of the government. You will perceive
that while the constitutional article
is a guarantee 'by the United States
to each State against domestic vio
lence the act of Congress restricts ex
ecutive interference to tle cases in
which ther;e is an insurrection in a
State again`t the government thereof;
one of the prerequisites is an applica
tion to the P'resident.by thi executive,
whed the .:gislatnre cannot be con
-.--- The 'et tlf the third of ml I:kL
i870, s'ction 1, statuties ab lre, aln
thorizes the President to employ such
part of the land or naval force of the
United States as shall be judged ne
cessary to suppress insurrection in a
State against the government thereof.
Having first observed all the pre
requisites of the law, now, if any
such application was made by Wil
liam P. Kellogg, he was not the Gov
ernor of Louisiana on Monday, Sep
tember 14, 1874, he left the State
house and retired to the Custom-house,
where le is now, and has been con
tinuously since Monday, and at 9
o'clock on Tuesday the State-house
was in possession of the present ex
isting government. In order that
there should be an insurrection in a
State agajnst the government thereof
there must be a gogrnment against
which opposition ad insurrection
exist, which is not tree now and has
not been true in Louisiana at any time
since 2 o'clock on Tuesday, Septem
ber 15, 1874. But when all the other
conditions exist, before the President
can employ any part of the land or
naval forces he must, by proelama
tien, command the insurgetts to dis
perse and to retire peaceably to their
respective abodes within limited timne.
The proclamation has been isued and
the time has been limited to live days.
Now we protest that this proclama
tion does not apply to as or to the
people of Louisiana, but even a case
where the necessary conditions exist,
an insurrection in a State against
the government thereof, and a proper
application to the Presideirt he can
not employ any part of the landeor
naval forces until the expiration of
the time limited by him in piroclama
tion. We distinctly announce to you
that in any movement on may maite
to suppress our government, tlhat there
shall, in no case, he iterposed any
armed or forcible resistance, on our
part to the militairy forces of the Unit
ed States under your cojiomand. We
will occupy the State-bhouse and other
State property in this city until the
appearance and occupation of the
same by tihe authorities of the gov
ernment of the United States, when
we shall retire, knowing we have sur
rendered the same alone to the gov
ernment of the United States.

IT&Sbrrender.
New Orleans, Sept. 17..-At 6 p at.,
in accordance with arrangemeun cs pre
viadtly made, Gen. J. 1. Brokte, ac
companied by Lieutenants Waliace
and Roe, went to thie esgntive oilce
at the St. Louis Hotel. lmediately
npon the entrance of General Brooke,
Gov. McEnery and Penn, shaking
hands with him, introduced the three
Federal officers to a number of proie
iaent citizens present. Governor Me
Enery then stated to Genetal Brooke
that he gave him possession of the
State Capital and other State build
ings within the limits of the city.
Gen. Brooke merely bowed in accep
ance and the Governor then read to
him the following address:
Gtn. BROOKE: As the lawful and
acting Governor of the State, I sir
render to you, as the representative
of the government of the United
States, the capitol and the remaindc:
of the property of this city belong-,
ing to the State. This surrender is
in response to a formal demand of
General Emory for such surrender, or
to accept, as an alternative, the levy
ing of war on our government by the
nilitary forces of the United States
under hi. command. As I have al
ready said to Gieneral Emory, we liave
neither the power nor inclination to
resist the United Sates. Sir, I trans
fer to you the guardianship of the
rights and liberties of the people of
the State, and I trust and believe
that you will give protection to all
classes of our citizens, iuled and ru
ined by a corrupt usurpation presid
ed over by Mr. Kellogg. Our peo
ple could bear the wrong, tyramiy,
annoyance and insults of that usur
pation no longer, and they arose in
their might and swept it from exist
ence, and installed in authority the
rightful government, of which I am
the head. All lovers of llberty
throughout the Union must .lmire
the patriotism that aroused our peo
ple to act as one man and throw off
the yoke of this usurpation. I know,
sir, as a soldier, you have but to obey
the orders of the government of the
United States, but I feel that you
will temper your military control of
affairs with moderation, and in all
things exhibit that integrity of pur
pose characteristic of officers of the
army. I now turn over to you, sir,
the capitol and other property of the
State under my charge."
[Signed] Jons McENEzvY.
At the conclusion of this address
Gen. Brooke was seated in the otfice,
and required from Lieutenant Gov
ernor Penn a statement of all records.

they took possession. Governor Mc
Enery and his followers then with.
drew, leaving the capitol of Louisi

thus truthfully and graphically sums
up the plots and schemes of the Be-.
publican party and the real designs
upon the people of Louisiana:
.The whole business is an election
eering scheme, and the trouble in
Lomislana was started by Kellogg's
vile emissaries, with the express pur. i
pose of provoking difculty, iri order
to furnish an occasion for calling in u
the military, That the Attorney Gen
eral was a party to this deviltry will 1
haldry be disputed by those who have
watched his ngerupulous eoUnrse, who
thave seen him scorned even by his
own party, who knew him to behes
sentially corrupt, and who have no'
faith in his public or personal integri
ty where the last interest is involved.

MlcAfee, Superintendent of the Uni.

torn Farmer that for three years past
he has grown Lima beans without
poles or saakes, by persistent pinch
ing back after they reach the desired
hight-=aboat that of common bunch

very perceptibly earlier and thinks it
is increased in quantity-the plait,

The neat scheme of the carpet-bag
ger, is to have a Southern Conven
tion on the:31st pf October to Concoct
an address of lies and defamation of
the Southern people, so as to'Justify
and exceuse the military pressure
which is to be employed prior to the
elections in November. Thisconven
tlon the carpet-bag managers propose
tb hbold at Atlanta, Ga., but have
chaiged the location to CBhattaooga:.
One of the most amusning and
startling stories putt eat by the
carpet~-bagers is that there are to be
no: ode-holders and no thieves in the
convention. It has been suggested by
some to have the body opened with
prayer by the Rev. Henry Ward

WAsmING POWDE.-.In Belgium
anld Holland linen is prepared beauti
fully, because the Iwasherwomeu use
refined borax instead of soda, as a
washing powder. One large handful
of borax is used to every 10 gallons
of water, and the saving of soap is
said to be one-half. For laces and
cainbries an extra quantity is uied.
Borax does not injure the linen,
6,66 soft..'i the h]1rs.est water. A
tiaspooutul of borax added to an oi -
dinary kettle of hard water, in which
it is allowed to boil, will effcctual!y
soften the water.
CArsuP.--I peck of ripe tomatoes.
Cut a slit in each one to allow the
juice to escape, and put in a porce
lain kettle over a slow lire, letting
them boil until the pulp is dissolved;
when cool enough, press through a
colander; then, if it is desired free of
seedr and very smooth, through a
hair sieve. Return to the fire, and
add j ounce of salt, 1 ounce of mace,
2 table-spoonfuls of celery seed (eith
er put in a bag, to be taken out when
done cooking, or thrown in to be
left) ; mix smoothly with a scant cup
fiul of vinegar, 1 table-spoonful of
black pepper, the same of powdered
cloves, and 7 of ground mustard, al
lowing it to boil live or six hours,
stirring well and often the last two;
remove the mace and pour into a
stone jar. Let it stand on the cellar
floor, closely covered twenty-four
hours. Add a pint of strong vinegar,
bottle, cork and seal. Keep ia a
cool, dry place.
A little glycerine added to gum or
glue is a great improvement, as it
prevents thie gum or glue becoming
brittle. It also prevents gummed
lables from having a tendency to
curl up when being written on.
IJrtoVINc STroCK.--There has been
much complaint that the prices of
short-horn stock are far above the
reach of ordinary farmers. This is
very true as regards what is known
as fashionable stock. Ten, twenty or
thirty thousand dollar animals are
not for farmers who have their bread
to win from their farms. Bint yet it
i- bu. the goldea settiung which sur
rounds these, animals, the fashion of
their families, their pedigree, that
makes them so attractive, just as the
golden setting might enhance the val
ue of any article, without adding a
cent of value to its own intrinsic
worth. There are thousans of short
horn bulls in the country which with
out doubt, would sire as good a steer
as might be got by a "duke." Not
long since a bull of unfashionable
blood was sold for $500, about the
same time as $15,000 would have
been given for the "Second Duke of
Hillhurst," and nuu.eroua excellent
judges have held the first to be the
better bull. Now, the lesson of all
this is that farmers should not be mis
led by the glitter and glory of those
vaunted fashionable animals into the
belief that there is no excellence else
where. The grand patriarch from
which these dukes and duchesses
sprang was purchased for $40, and
there have been, possibly, as good
young bulls sold for less than 8100'
within the past thirty days in Ken
tucky, as was the bull Hubback in
1787. if farmers should be misled
by the present high prices of fash
ionable stock, it were better that the
dukes had never been born. Nothing
is more needed than an improvement
in our beef stoek. Recently stock
was brought all the way from Texas
and sold in the New York market for
25to $30 a head. Those who are
familiar with the beef that is supplied
to thie markets of country towns and
villages know that there is much of
it that is of no greater vainqe than
this from Texas. The beefconsumed
in country places is of the poorest
character. The best in the country
is taken to the large cities, but yet
there is muchl there that is'inferior.
The feeding of all this inferior stoek
is a waste and a loss to all concerned.
It is a los even to the consumer for
the poor, who can -least asiford to
eonasme inferior meat, are those who
use it. Breeders of short-hdrastoek,
other tian fashionable strains, .com
plain that there is no demand for
blls. This is unfortunate, and we
apprehend it is owing to some extent
to a mistaken idea that there is a
closer connection between high prices
and fairly good stock than is warrant
ed by the facts, that the absence of
this'demnand is to be attribiuted. We
would suggest to breeders the ad'
vantage of turning some of the un
salable bulls into feeding animals,
and their ebxhibitioi4 as beef cattle at
the agricultural fairs wheore they may
see and appreciate them. T:he exhli
bition of grade streers from short
horn stock might also add greatly to
the reputatija of the sires, Tbe ear
ly inatutity and great weight of this
class of stock is an adiantage that
cannot be too highly considemEd by
farmers who are raising. cattle for
market, but as yet, unfortunately, tile
abort-horns are not suafliiently popu
lar with tlhose who make this use of
their stock.
