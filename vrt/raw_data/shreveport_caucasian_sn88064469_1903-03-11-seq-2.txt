Early Rising Noat Always a Virtue.
Thou-':: l- ,oplei have no choice
- what ,r ,out thir hour of rising in
B the moral :g. Later or earlier, that
hour is ftixed for them by the require
ments of the ohice, the shop or the
classroom. by the time table of the rail
road, by !-,e arbitration of their em
ployers :r the nec(esities of their em
ployees. But in the cases manifold
- where per0onal liberty is enjoyed it
should not be thoughtlessly restricted
simply because of thei domestic tradi
tion that early rising deserves praise
and lIte ri ilg blaine.
e lrtkfast may often be a moval)le
n feast without materially disturbing the
routine of an orderly housekeeping day.
d valids, mothers who:-e rest has been
broken byh teething babies and, above
all, rapidly growing children, should
haive their sleep out. Nature demands
a this, and violence is done to her when
sleepy people are ruldely aroused from
r their beds. Early to bed is the single
h safe prescription to insure early to rise.
We need to repeat it over and over to
our hurrying, anxious, toiling Amer
ican men and women: Rest, rest and
n again rest. I)o not think time ill spent
that is spent in repairing the rav'ages
of our well nigh incessant activity.
The First Pantomime.
Most _pantominme characters were
originally borrowed from the Italians.
The first real English pantomime was
produced at a theater in Lincoln's Inn
t Fields in 1720. It was called. "Harle
quin Executed," and its subti:le was
"A New Italian Comic Scene Between
a Scaramouche, a IIarlequin, a Coun
try Farmer, Ilis Wife and Others."
The performance was very successful.
About the middle of the eighteenth cen
tury the character of pantomime per
formances was completely altered,
chiefly because of the genius of the fa
mous Grimaldi, who made the clown
the first figure of the pantomime. Gri
maldi first appeared at Sadler's Wells
theater, where he played the part of a
monkey. He was actively engaged on
the stage for forty-nine years, and at
the close of his stage career he took a
benefit at Drury Lane theater, which
realized nearly £600. HIe also received
£100 from the Drury Lane fund. This
was in June, 182S. He died in 1837 and
was buried in the churchyard, in St.
James' chapel, Pentonville hill.-Lon
don Standard.
Animals and Poisons.
Certain substances which are deadly
In their effects upon men can be taken
by the brute creation with impunity.
Horses can take large doses of anti
mony, dogs of mercury, goats of tobac
co, mice of hemlock and rabbits of
belladonna without injury. On the
other hand, dogs and cats are much
more susceptible to the influence of
chloroform than mhn and are much
sooner killed by it. If this invaluable
anaesthetic had been first tried upon
animals, we should probably have nev
er enjoyed its blessings, as it -would'
have been found to be so fatal that its
discoverer would have been afraid to
test its effects upon human beings. It
is evident, then, that an experiment
upon an animal can never be the
means of any crtain deductions so far
as man is concerned.-Family Doctor.
Skyrbekets Before Gunpowder.
It matters very little in the long run
to the small boy when, how or where
fireworks were first made and of what
they are made now. But the fact re
mains that the despised heathen Chi
nese first made them and used them
and that civilized communities did not
*know'of them until the fourteenth cen
tury, The skyrocket was first invented
toward the close of the ninth century
and at that time was used, so it is said,
hi India and China in war, That was

Carols-Dnrn's Revenge on Sargent.
When John S. Sargent, the famous
portrait painter, studied in the atelier
of Carolus-Duran in Paris, his teacher
showed his fondness for him by paint
ing in his head in the gr at ceiling of
the Luxembourg palace. Even after
he branched out for himself his mas
ter often sent for him to come over to
his studio and pose, his hands having
especially won the admiration of Caro
Slus-Duran. The time came, however,
when Sargent could no longer answer
the beck and call of his teacher, for he
was getting work of his own to do,
which would not allow him to leave his
studio at a moment's notice. One day,
it is related, Carolus-Duran sent a hur
ry call for him, and when he received a
note saying that Sargent was compel
led to decline his request owing to
pressing work he was furious. A few
days later a friend, to whom he had
colfided his anger at his recalcitrant
pupil, asked him: "Well, how is it with
Sargent? Have you made up? How is
he?" "Ah, no," said the painter, and
he looked sad and his shoulders went
up. "'How is it with Sargent? C'est
fini!" Another shrug. "C'est fini! ,It's
all over! I have been to the Luxem
bourg. I wei* and I got a ladder, and
I painted out his head!"
A Ghost Test.
When you think you see a ghost,
how can you tell whether it really is
a ghost or not? A recent writer gives
the following scientific method: "We
assume that a person sees an appari
tion. It may be objective-i. e., having
existence outside the observer's mind
or merely a creature of a disordered
brain, subjective. The seer, while look
ing at the vision with both his eyes,
gently depresses one eyeball with his
forefinger from outside the top eyelid,
so causing a squint. If objective,
whether bogus or not, two outlines of
the 'ghost' will be seen, but one, of
course, if it be subjective. One may
prove this by trial any time with any
object, near or far. I mention this be
cause of the many nervous and brain
wearied people who see spooks and to
whom it would be better that they
should know that the trouble is with
in themselves and so seek a capable
doctor than continue to be haunted, as
they believe, by the supernatural."
The Rometrng of Lake Erief
The 250 mile trough of Lake Erie lies
approximately in the direction of the
west to southwest winds which prevail
in that part of the cointry. Thus the
lake offers an excellent opportunity for
studying the effects of the wind upon
a large body of inclosed water, and
very interesting these effects some
times prove. Rhythmic gusts produce
a rocking motion and great blows from
the west or southwest sweep the liquid
body of the lake eastward and some
times cause a rise of eight feet or more
at Buffalo in the course of a few hours.
As soon as the maximum force'of the
gale has passed the water swings back.
Continued rockings are observed on
days when the strength of the wind
fluctuates.-Youth's Companion.
Fabrio of Daily Life.
It is not of lofty or heroic deeds that
the enduring pattern oft character is
woven, but rather of the seemingly
small things of life. Little unheralded
acts of helpfulness, slight self denials
that bar against selfishness, conscien
tious attention to trifling details of du
ty, standing firm to the right in spite
of banter and contempt (really the most
difficult thing for young or old to with
stand), adherence to scrupulous hones
ty in word and deed even in what oth
ers consider of no import, sticking' to
principle though one masr be called
"old fashioned," -..unprogressive" or
"puritanical" - these are the golden
strands which. woven into the fabric
of daily living, make men and women
intingible.-Success.
Mistake In the Leoality.
That keen rivalry which western
towns feel is probably responsible for
the story about Seattle, which may well
have been.said of some other place at
some pther time. It concerns a Seattle
man who died and went to the here
after.
"1 don't see," he remarked, after a
casual survey of his new quarters,
"that heaven is so much b.etter than
Seattle."
"But this Isn't heaven," explained a
bystander.-New York Tribune.
Sow the Aaeleata Regarded Iron.
The ancient Egyptians believed that
iron was the bone of Typhon, the ene
my of Osiris, and for this reason it was
considered impure. No one could make
use of it even for the most ordinary
requirements of life without polluting
his soul in a way that would cause
him harm both on earth and in the
other world.
Were I to pray for -a taste which
should stand me In stead under every
variety of circumstance and be a source
of happiness and cheerfulness to me
during life and a shield against iIs,
however things might go amiss and
the world frown upon me, it would be
a taste for readhig.-81r John Herehel.
