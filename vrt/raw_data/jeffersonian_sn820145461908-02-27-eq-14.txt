ANTI-LIQUOR SOCIETY.
A New Method Adopted in Kansas to Fight
Liquor aaid Tobacco.
The Kansas Anti-Liquor Society has opened
an office in Kansas City, Mo., from which it
is distributing, free of charge, a prescription
for the cure of the liquor habit, also one for
the cure of the tobacco habit. Either prescrip
tion can be filled by any druggist. The only re
quest the Society makes is, that people send
ing for the prescription will not sell them, but
give free copies to their friends. Either pre
scription can be given secretly.
Over 500,000 of these prescriptions have
been sent to people who have written for
them. Parties wishing either or both prescrip
tions should address the Kansas Anti-Liquor
Society, Room 200 Gray Bldg., Kansas City,
Mo., and inclose a stamp. There has been a
constant fight in Kansas ever since the state
went prohibition to reopen it to the saloons.
There is no evil comparable in its effect
or character to that of a craven submission to
manifest wrong.—Lowell.
