ABRAIIA MICHIIAELSO..
I reside at Caimpte, Louisiana. I
was in the town of Natchitoches on
the twenty-first of Septeniber, 1878.
I was a member of the Demuocratic
convention. T'he convention was
callied to order about 12 o'clock; I
ain not certain, however, about it.
The contfusion that caused the ad
jouiirnment camte a short time after its
Ineerting. A report came in the con
enlation that the ne'groes were forms
illg and were albout to break up the
collnvention. The convention broke
up in disorder.
I sent to Levy & Phillip's store.
Some delegates went down town to
see wihether the report about the ne
gr'oes was true. I saw some of tile
delehgates with arms, they were not
lmnny. The conventlion was compos
ed' of about one hundred members.
About twenty-tive persons had arms.
Levy & Phillips' store is about three
sqlares fromu the court house. I then 1
sentt, after staying twenty minutes,
to \\ inbarg's store. I went and
armed imyself after I beard the report
that the negroes would come to t:ake I
the town. I armed myself with a
gtnn and pistol. I left the gun at Mr.
Bat Ih's lhouse.
Witness was shown the published
list of the nlembers of the convention a
and testilied it was correct to the
best of his knowledge, and they were
all present with the exception of one
ward. The witness was then exam
iined as to each member and his prees
elce at the court-house. He could I
not remember the names of tlhe men I
who weres under arms. Mr. Con- I
ningham was at the head of the arm.
ed party, but could not say whether I
he was armed or not. Knows R. A.
Blunt; he is usually called Rafe
Blunt. I saw him on the day refer- I
red to. lHe was under arrest, and
was brought to the court-house. Mr.
Cunningham was in the party with 1
others. The Vindicator is the paper i
published in Natchitoches.
G. W. LUCKEY
sworn. I reside in Natchitoches and.
always voted the Democratic ticket.
I went into the town of Natchitoches
to pay mny taxes. I was there part of
the time that the convention was in
session, and part I was not. I think
the first time the convention broke up
was about 3 o'clock. A motion to
adjourn was made, but I don't know
the words it was made in. The
meeting appeared somewhat confused
when it broke up. I did not see any I
armed men for some hours after that. t
I went to a restaurant for my dinner s
when I left.
It may have been an hour af- f
terwards, that I saw armed men. I a
saw Blunt that night at the euort
house. He was under arrest, but I
cannot say who had him in charge. 1
cannot remember any men who were
under arms. Mr. Cunningham was in
tommand of the party who had B.unt I
in change.
Cross-examined by Mr. Beekwith- I
I got into Natchitoches about 9 o'clock
that morning. I was not a candidate
for any office, I visited the convernt
tion as a looker on. I recollect that
there was a motion to adjourn, but do
not remember that there were any
speeches.
I do not know whether the eonven. 1
tion was in confusion. There were I
uoveral meubbers standing on the
floor. I heard it from several par
ties around tihe court-honee that the I
adjournment was to go and break op I
a Republican nleeting. I can't say a
whlethler thete was any apprehension I
of trouble in the court-house. I heard
that the negroes were going to at
tempt to take the town and the con
vention broke up to resist this.
I Iearsd that evening there was
some firing down at the Dirt Bridge.
When tile seport came in there was a
call for men to go down there. I'
heard that thlere were pickets placed
cat. I left early next morning. Th're
was considerale distnrbance during
tile night. There Fs considerable(
excitement before and after the fring
at the Dirt Bridge.
Re-dirert-I live thirty miles from
Nyatelhiteches. I did not get any arma.
I don't know that I had any appre4 I
hiension of being killed that day. I
did not see any armed negroes when
I went ihome the thirty miles. I
live in ward two In the parish. I
could not say how many men were
aromnd tile court-house, but there
was a erowd. 4
A. Michelson, who had been called I
uloIn to exanline a copy of the Natch I
itechles Vindicator, then came in and
said its report of the convention was
Testimony resnmed. I went home l
on Sunday morning with a Mr. Pghi. i
I live tell miles from the town of,
Natclilodches. I did not see any art ]
eced cegroes on my way. The meet- I
ilg of the convention broke up, to tile
best of nmy knowledge, about 11 or n
12 o'clock.
Crose.ezamined by Mr. Lusenburg.
I was a member of the convention. It I
hass been advertised about two weeks. 4
There were about 125J men around a
tile eort-house that day. Tile ,n
convention was held to nominate
parochiail offeicers. The covention ad- 4
oaurned because of the reports in cir
julation that the negroes were com
ing to take the town. The real oh 4
ject of tlie convention In break'ng up
was to resist in self.defense, the at- [
tack of the negroes. I started to go I
down to the Dirt Bridge, where !
tie trouble was, bat was stopped-'
after it was over. There Is a very i
large negro population below Nateb- I
itoches, on Cane river.
RIe-direet-When the report epame I

take long for the convention to get
out. I did not have my gun when
I started to go down to dirt bridge.
I turned back to get it, and went to
the court-house. 4
ISAAC KAHIN.
I live in Natchitoches and have for
fifteen or sixteen years. I have act
ed with neither political party. 1
live about 100 yards from the court
house. The store were my son keeps
is right near the court-house ; it ad
joins it. I did not go to the Demo.
cratic convention that day. I saw no
armed men that day in Natchitoches.
I did not see Blunt and did not go to
the court-house. I stayed at the
store until night. I was very busy
that day. The business of the store I
went on just the same as every day.
There was my son and myself in the
store. People came in and went out
waking purchases, just as always.
ISAAC JACOBS.
I live in the town of Natehitoches,
in the lower portion of the town. My I
residence is about seventy-five feet
from my store. I am married and have
a family. The meeting held was 4
about 150 feet from my store, more or i
less, I cannot say. There must have
been a hundred or more on the out- (
side of the building. I can't say how I
many were on the inside. I stayed
in my store all day and saw armed (i
men passing to and fro. There was I
so much excitement I could not say 2
who was in the party. I remember
Theodore Schuman in the party. r
John Tucker was going up. I think e
Capt. Russell was in command that a
day. I can't exactly say. The crowd r
was about seventy five or a hundred.
I did not arm myself that day. I F
lived one-quarter of a mile from the g
dirt bridge. I did have much appre- t
hension for my family. 1
Cross-examined by Judge Egan. e
The quarantine station is between a
my store and the bridge. I never t
knew, for a number of years, the neo
groes to meet at Dirt Bridge. I
know of them holding many meet. 1
ings in the parish. It was half a F
mile from the quarantine station to t
the court.house. I know Judge Pier- d
son. On that day he passed my a
store some distance ahead of the f
crowd of men. I saw him go into c
his house about half an hour before
the body of men went by. I saw no a
weapons on him. He was goio to i
his own home,
I saw Johnny Tucker that day; he I
had a gun with him, I believe.
A. MUnDocK (colored.) r
I live in Natchitoches, and have
ror thirty years. I was not in town
on September, 1878. I got in town
on the evening of the day. I remem
ber I saw Upsher Breaseale with a
gon. He told me to get off the street
and I got off.
No cross-examination.
MRS. R. A. BLUNT (colored.)
On the twenty-fist of September,
1878, I was at home in Natchitoches.
Between II and 12 o'clock I inquired
what was the matter from my lanU
band. I saw men coming, all armed.
The house was surrounded by armed
pen. Mrs. Hains asked me wheth
or I was going to leave the house.
My husband, after giving orders
not to open the door, went into the
garret. The crowd knocked at the
door. Judge Chaplin said that only
tour or five would go ia. He said for I
homanity's sake to open tbe door. I
refused to, and be left. The door
was then broken in and Mr. Canoing- I
ham pointed a pistol at my head and
led me out of the house into the t
street. Orders were then given to
march the women to jail. At the re
quest of my husband I visited him h
and he gave me his watch and book.
They, the guards over Mr. Blount, i
made a light after I got Iate the room
where he wasunder guard. Mr. Cnn
ningham said, "Blunt I want some
asurance from you, for the negroes
are forming below town." There
were some men on horseback shouting
for "98 if298 !"
Witness then explained her advicea
to the negroes to disperse.
It was after 10 o'clock when I got'
barck to my house. I was sitting in a
rocking-chair when I heard horses,
and Mr. Blunt came in between two
men. I recognized his voice, and I
picked up the light and went down.
He told me to have his horse ready at I
once. The naeo told him to harry op. a
Cross-examined by Mr. Luzeoburg.
On the twenty-grst of dIeptember the
house was srrounded by a crowd. I
declined to open the door and it was
broken open. Mr.Cunooningham held
tihe pistol so close to me thatiff
toraed it would have touched me.
I cannot identify Mr Cunoingham.t
I know that he had a light hat with a
broad band. I eannot say positively
(pointing to Mr. M. J. Cunningham)
whetlher it:is this gentlemen or not.
I know that the man who pointed the i
pistol at me, and the man who re
quested Mr. Blunt to ouse his inlluenee
to mend out and desperse the negroes,
wore the same hat.
When I went back the seconed time
it was aboo 8 o'clock. I went to the I
court-hoase to see my husband,
and I sent in without opposition. C
Mr. Cnnlinghanm told the guard a
where to pilot me to, and I 'went at a
the request of Mr. Blunt to the no- a
I could not tell whether the me-.
groees had any arms, for the alighbi
was very dark. I saw one or two I
gnas is the party. These colored I
men were about thirty in the road. "
Eeb man seemed to be a leader.
They said, when I went to dissuade t
them from coming into the town, la
that Mr. Blunoat was their leader, aad
they had a right to demand him. At- I
te seomse talk I dissuded them. Capt. I
Jack Inatformed me that what they
wanted was for Mr. Bluntto stick to I
his churcb and quit polities, Ie is a [

I was in Natchitoclhes at Mr. Illunt's
house, on the twenty-first of Septem
tember. When Mr. Blunt came in lie
was very pale, and was followed by
acrowd of men. 11ie said that the
men wanted to kill him, simply be.
cause he had dared to open the lRe
publican canlpaign. I saw Mrs. Blunt
when she was returning from jail. I
went to go snrety for Mr. Blunt, be.
ing a real estate owner. It was about
nine o'clock when Mrs. Blunt said
she was requested to go out of town'
to the Dirt Bridge, and speak to the
crowd there. I, knowing Mrs. Blunt
was ani invalid went with her. She
told the colored men, there were
about twenty, that Mr. Blunt was in
the htnds of the Democrats.
NAARY BLUNT (colored)
was called. The witness said that
she lived in N1atchitoehes. There
were armed men (about 2(N)) in front
of my father's house. Mr. M. J. Cun
ningham was the captain of the mob.
J. T. King, James Cosgrove and Mr.
Jack were with the mob. Mr. M. H.
Carver and Simour Curtis were there;
Mi. David Pierson also.
I was in tile house and heard men
on the outside turning the slats to
look in. There was a light whisker
ed man there, and he said: "God
d- it; there's fourteen negroes in
here." I said : "It'. fourteen lies."
A man outside said that if iMr. Blunt
was an honest man lie would come out
or let them in. I said that my fath
er was an honest man as there was,
and there wasn't a man, colored or
white, who could coincide with him.
Sam Rains broke the door down. I
would not open the door even for my
grandfather. The crowd went into
the kitchen and ate everything up.
Then they pumped all the water out
of the cistern looking for my father
afterward under arrest. I was taken
to the court-house bareheaded, and,
youn might say, barefooted.
Cross-examined by Mr. Beckwith.
The first I saw of my father that day
was about 8 o'clock. I was part of
the time up stairs and part down. I
did not see the nine negroe men
when they came in. My mother
fastened the door. I know that, be
cause she had the keys.
When I heard the rushing on the
street I was just up stairs. The men
in the house were members of our con
gregation. They were Jos. Jones,
Edward Page. Harrison Baldwin,
Wm. Russell, Esau Davis. I doe't
remember their names. Besides my
self there was my motler and a Mr.
Leroy in the house. I saw the crowd
when It approached the house. When
I got down stairs the men were only
on the front of the house. A man
who stays in our yard went to get
over the fence to go and get his gun,
and somebody yelled out, "There he
goes."
I don't think Mrs Paris was in the
house when the crowd came. Before
the door was broken open I saw Mr.
Levy and Mr. Cunningham outside.
The crow was waiting, and Mr. Levy
eame up and asked, "What is the
matter ?" and the crowd told him
that tie door was locked. He said
that he was broad enough to defy the
United States, slapping his left
shoulder. I am certain it was Col.
Levy, because I have known him
since I wase child. I saw Mr. Cos
grove; was standing in the street,
right in front, with a pistol drawn at
his side. There were a namber of
people between him sad I.
Sam Rains was the first man to en
ter the house, atd Joe Conningham.
Isaw the demijohn on the floor, an4o I
suppose from that that tihe crowd was
lookinog for him ino the demiajohn.
They went back to the cistern, which
is underground, and pomped the
water, or some of it, out. I don't
know whether they wanted to
Gnd my father under water or not.
The house where I live belongs to
me; my father never owned it. That
day up there they carried me to the
court-house under guard. I saw
Barlow that day in front of Mr. Me.
Daniel's store. He did not speak to
me.
H. RABY.
sworn. I reside ia Natchitoches. I
went there in 1857. I have been a
member of the Legsleature from that
parish. I have acted with the Re
publicns. I was at the meeting on
September 23, 1878. I went down
Front street to Nelkin's store and
stayed there some time. I iad some
basiness with Mr. Cunningham, and
as soon as the meeting adjourned I
saw Mr. Breda and his brother go by,
I met a man who told me in the store
that there was a body of armed men
coming. Twoor three colored men
same fate thie store. I went in, and,
speaking to the old gentleman, told
him I wanted a drink. I then stayed
in the back yard until nearly night,
when Ijumped the fence, to go home.
From the store I went to my house,
but did not stay there; I went to a
neighbor's and stayed all night.
While I was away a body of gentle
men came to my house.
Mr. Cunningham I senat for and lie
came. I asked him what was tihe
matter. lie said that he would do
all that he could in the matter for
me, and that be had already made
hieoself obnoxious to tihe people for
assisting those under arrest,
I was kept under arrest until about
II o'eleck. I asked for three days to
lx up y business, When they de.
manded me to leave the parish. I
odffered to give my word or any pledge
that they wanted. I senat for eirena
of my friends to intereede for me.
About 12 o'clock Mr. Cunaoinghm
came into the room where I was
guarded and beekoned to me and
said that I must leave the parish.
We were all at the lower end f the
eourt lehouse when we were tlking.
Mr. Cunningham esid that be bhad
never killed anybody, but if I Atewr
S4ar a he would i.- abe
:I was to gp ouats certalar .ruat ad
go to Westley Sheppard and there get
a horse. I went until I struck the
bayou back of the convent; then I
crossed the Old river and laid all day
Tuesday in a ditch. While lying
there I saw armed men passing by.
I went to an old man's and asked
for something to eat, and lie would
not give me anything, because of his
fear. I gradually made my way out
of the plarish.
One of the guards over me was
Prank Raggio, and a gentleman there
named Sprowl and W. W. Breazeale.
Cross-examined by Judge Egan.
In 1870 I was elected to the Legisla
ture. In 72, '74 and 76 1 was re
elected. I have told all I remember
of the conversation with Mr. Cun
ningham. I was placed under guard
for my own protection. 1 went to
Ilapides parish, and then in the early
part of November, I returned, and
have been in Natchitocbees ever since.
I got down to this city last night
only.
I never made any threats against
any one. I had a conversation with
MIr. Geniusi lie was a great Green
back man, and when we met we al
ways had a talk. He wanted me to
join the Greenback party, and I said
that if I could see that the Greenback
party was a poor man's friend I would
join the party. He told me that the
Democratic party had swallowed up
the Greenback party and had adopt.
ed a greenback plank. He asked me
to advise tihe negroes to join the
Democratic party. I told him that I
could not go to those whom I had
told to vote the Republican ticket to
now vote the Democratic ticket.
I never told Mr. Genius that if the
Democrats did not cease to hold night
ueectings there would be somebody
knocked in the head.
I was present at a meeting in the
town of Natchitoces on the fourteenth
of September. There was a meeting
of the executive committee of the
Republican party in Mr. Breda'sstore.
The report in the Vindicator came
out knd said that I had said the
whites would have to stop night
hawking or *somebody would get
hurt. This is false.
P. BREDA.
I live in Natchitoches parish and
have since the war. I was at the
Republican meeting in that parish in
September, 1878. We had, my broth
er and myself, started to go home.
We had not gone 260 yards when we
came to a body of armed men.
I asked why the public streets
were blocked and was told that it
was nore of my d---d business. I
circled around the town and got home.
The men in the armed gang were W.
W. Breazeale, W. O. Breazeale, Jules
Messi, Emile Prodhomme, Dick Flema
ing and Samuel Hyams.
When we got home we went hunt
ing on a neighboring plantation. My
brother and myself went to the quary
antine station to learn what was go
ing on in town, and learned that
Blunt was captured. We heard a
party coming and I recognized John
Trichel in it. They asked for my
house and then they started for it.
We followed. They seemed to be
satisfied when they found out where
it was.
The message was brought to as
that we must leave the parish or suear
render by Mr. Dranguet. He said
that we must leave the parish.
Mr. Dranguet is my mother's broth
er. I voted with the Republican par.
tgy in the last three elections. I
woaould have voted for J. Madison
Wells at the last election for Con
gress. I was coroner for two terms
in the parish.
Crose-examined by Lusenborg. I
was present at a meeting held in my
brother's office September 14. There
were about twenty-four there. I re
member Blunt, H. L. Brigga, Lewis
and others were there whose names I
cannot recall.
It was agreed that there shoald be
a meeting; that the twenty.first
would be a good day for it. It ha.
been published before that the Dean.
ocratic convention was going to make
nominatioos, and was going to meet
the same day. It was discosed, and
it was concluded that, as we were to
meet at a different place, it would be
prudent.
It was thought that the twenty.
Brst, being Saturday, would be a
good day, for people could get away
trnmeworking their crops.
I was at the meeting of the twenty
frst at the quarantine station. The
station was to prevent ingress and
egress to ad from the town. It was
here we held our meeting. There
were 150 or 180 present at the meet,
lng. I had a pistol at the meeting. I
cannot say whether my brother was
armed at that meetag or not. I saw
no arms on any person there. I live
a little over a mile and a half from
the station. The quaroantine station
is nearly three-qaarters a mile from
time court-house. The crowd my
brother and myself met in the road
did not follow us.
Mr. Dranguet came to me on Sun
day nmorning, the twenty-seonad, and
said that be had something very im
portant to confer with us, and he
said that we must leave the parish.
I heard a rumor, a long time after
it took place, that there had been
firiong on tihe quarantine guards.
I heard of no intended attack on
the town by the negroees after Blunt's
captare. I do not think themr was
May intention to make an attack.
R. A. BLUNT.
I know James Gensios and bad a
conversatio in his store with bhim on
the ecmpaign of 1878. 1 seed to go
into his store, and be would say that
if I would attend to my church and
and mind my business I coid live in
the parisb. I told him that I was sold
out of the Radical party. Mr. Geniues
said that I ought to go into the
Greenback party. He id I had to
go ato the Grenback plrty or the
Democratic. I' told him I was no

,t the Greenback party. He told me
e that the negroes would be extinct,
I and I had better withdraw and leave
r politics. I can almost feel the balls
g the people up there had for me.
Examined by Mr. Beckwith. I do
d not know that the rate of taxation
I was run up to 10 per cent of the valE
Sne of the property of the parish of
t Natchitoches. The Natchitoches Vin
dicator published that the taxes
t amounted to about eighty mills up
, there. I was a slave before the war.
.I began to exliort and was ordained
. in 1869. I have had charge of the
- Baptist Church in Natchitoches.
While I was pastor of the church I
r was elected to the Legislature.
When I was freed I cannot tell
I how much money I had. I went out
i as a woodchopper and sold wood to
r steamboats. When I left the Legis
I lature I had my little per diem. I
brought down to the Legislature
$1600 around my waist.
Mr. Beckwith-Are you sure that
it was to the Legislature and not
from it that you carried that money
around your waisLt
Blunt-Yes, sir, (laughter) I am
sure of that.
I was on the school board in Natch.
itoches. I had a contract with the
board of school directors at $100 a
month and I hired a teacher at $gl,
but it was under a written contract.
I as a school director contracted with
myself, but I did not make the mo
tion myself.
J. E. Breda-I know J. Madison
Wells. He is a man over 70. He is
a resident of Rapides parish.
The government rested its ease,
and it was nearly 4 o'clock when, on
the suggestion of Judge Egan, the
court adjourned until 10 a. min., March
1.
