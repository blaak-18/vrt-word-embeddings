What Our Farmers are Saying
and Doing
(Concluded from Page 2)
go forward and discharge it?
The compress can be installed at
once and be ready to serve you for
this crop, and any good engine at any
good gin in the county can operate
the compress, and the speaker wants
to see Oak Grove Local and John
Hamilton’s gin the, first to awaken,
and it will soon be seen that the ef
fect o fyour intelligent effort through
organization in this most important
direction, will have borne good fruit,
and at every gin in the Southland
will be a compress and other ma
chinery for the proper and intelli
gent handling of a bale of cotton,
and as these bales are transported
across the ocean to foreign shores
and wharves, to be run through mills,
to be converted into cloth for the
millions on the other side of the
world, they will see that we have at
last awakened! And it can only be
accomplished by intelligent organi
zation and well directed effort.
“Organize”—there is every reason
for, and not one against the farmers
organizing, for without organization
you will ever in the future, as in times
past, be the target of the world to
be laughed at as “hay-seeds,” but
with organization and wise leaders to
guide, the Farmers’ Union will go on
from one battle and victory to an
other and gaining strength as they
go, being ready for every good and
perfect work in making the world
brighter and better for having lived,
but especially to aid and help each
other in becoming intelligently awak
ened to the duty of getting out and
away from the slavery imposed by
debt,- carelessness, extravagance and
all the attendant evils resulting from
ignorance and carelessness.
By and through organization you
learn how much of certain crops to
produce, and when and where to get
better prices for your crops; and, bet
ter than all, plant fewer mortgages
each year, and then you will sooner
‘ be free, and once out of the bondage
of debt—keep out!
Educational and Co-operative!
What magical and wonderful words.
When the farmers and their fami
lies become educated to their’ own
relation to the world and realize the
part they are to play in life,’ and
each co-operate with the other for
mutual good and uplift through in
telligent organization, they will sure
ly come into their own.
Organization gave the stone cut
ters here and elsewhere freedom and
liberty and from SI.OO to $1.75 per
day wages to $3.00 per day, and they
can give as much work in eight
hours as they once did in twelve
hours. Organization alone brought
this wonderful result to them.
The Farmers’ Union is now closely
related to all labor organizations,
and as its members become more and
more educated on these lines will
more quickly accomplish greater
good, and see and realize that your
membership is a mighty paid-in capi
tal stock, and your energy and lands
well tilled, coupled with the early
and later rains, and the promise of
the Eternal God that seed time will
ever continue and that abundant har
vests shall reward well directed ef
fort, is a bright enough star of hope
