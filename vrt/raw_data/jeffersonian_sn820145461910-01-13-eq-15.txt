Missionary Advocates Challenge Mr. Watson
to Debate—His Reply
Dear Sir:—The Christian men of
America are displaying an extraor
dinary interest at the present time
in that form of religious propaganda
called Foreign Missions. Thoughout
the land this note is the dominant one
in all the churches. Most of the
leaders of our national life, includ
ing the President himself, give hearty
endorsement to the Foreign Mission
idea.
You, sir, are the only man of
standing known to us who openly
criticises and antagonizes Foreign
Missions. Many persons have been
greatly surprised by your utterances
upon this subject. Believing you to
be sincere and open-minded, and
willing to defend your views upon all
proper occasions, we, in behalf of the
men of the churches of your own
State of Georgia, desire to challenge
you to a public debate upon the
proposition to which you have so
vigorously given your endorsement,
“Resolved, That the Foreign Mis
sions as at present conducted by the
Christian churches is unwise, un
necessary, and fruitless.” Any other
phrasing of the subject that would
better express your well-known views
would be acceptable to us.
Our one desire is to have this sub
ject of Foreign Missions, which is
costing the churches $22,000,000
yearly, as well as many lives, and
which has grave diplomatic, com
mercial, racial, and other aspects,
thoroughly discussed in a public
manner, so that the truth may
emerge. We are persuaded that you,
sir, fully believe the grave charges
you have made against the Foreign
Mission enterprise.
We have asked a gentleman who
has no official relationship to For
eign Missions, a member of your pro
fession, Mr. William T. Ellis, of
Philadelphia, to debate this question
with you. Mr. Ellis, in the course of
his journalistic duties, recently made
a first-hand investigation of Foreign
Missions.
We suggest that the debate be
held In the Auditorium, in Atlanta,
on the evening of January 14, or on
an evening as near thereto as may
serve the convenience of yourself
and Mr. Ellis. The debate shall be
open to the public, without charge,
and the traveling expenses of the de
baters, the hire of the hall, etc., will
be met by a few Georgia men.
Awaiting your reply, and trusting
that nothing may hinder you from
championing in this public way the
views you have expressed in print
upon Foreign Missions, we are,
Respectfully yours,
E. C. CALLAWAY,

Mr. Watson’s Reply.
Messrs. E. C. Calloway, Marion McH.
Hull, F. L. Seely, and others, At
lanta, Ga.
Gentlemen:
Your favor, challenging me to
meet in debate, on the subject of
Foreign Missions, Mr. William T. El
lis, of the Philadelphia press, re
ceived.
If you will substitute the name of
Hon. W. J. Bryan for that of Mr.
Ellis, I will accept your invitation,
Mr. Bryan, himself, has spoken pub
licly and most approvingly of the
present methods of conducting For
eign Mission work, and you will prob
ably concede with great readiness
that Mr. Bryan is a stronger debater
than any one else on that side of the
question.
You can see, gentlemen, that if I
were to consent to meet every man
or woman who desired to have a
public discussion with me on this
question, there would be no end to it.
Should I accept a challenge to de
bate with so comparatively obscure a
man as Mr. Ellis, how could I de
cline to accept the dare of Mr. Any
body and Mr. Everybody who might
wish to advertise himself at my ex
pense? There would be no glory
in overcoming a person who has no
particular reputation, but, if you can
get Mr. Bryan to meet me, I will be
interested enough to drop everything,
come to Atlanta at my own expense,
and grapple with your forensic giant.
I understand that Mr. Bryan is now
in Cuba, and, therefore, I do not sup
pose it would be possible for you to
arrange a debate with him at the
time you have set; however, I will
agree to discuss this question with
him in Atlanta any time after May
Ist—provided he can not come in
January.
Allow me to say that you do not
accurately state my position when
you say that I am opposed to For
eign Missions. To the principle of
Foreign Missions, I am not antago
nistic. On the other hand, I believe
in the Pauline method of doing the
work, which the Christians prac
tised in the first 1800 years after
Christ. It is the modern innova*
tions which have thrown aside the
apostolic model and example that I
combat. I say that there is no
Scripture for it, no common-sense in
it, no patriotism, no true religion.
My contention is, that we are not
commanded to carry to “the Man of
Macedonia,” or any other heathen,
any other help than that of preach
ing and teaching the law and the
message of Christ. My opposition
is directed to the charity works
which have been established in pret
ty nearly every heathen country, at
the expense of the people of our
own country. We take up collec
tions for Foreign Missions, and we
devote that money to the establish
ment of orphanages, widows’ homes,
leper colonies, asylums for the blind
and the deaf and the dumb, free
apothecary shops, free medical and
surgical service, free kindergartens,
free secular schools, free books and
free tuition for the old and the young

of heathendom. We not only do
this, but we actually, in many cases,
buy the orphans that are to be sup
ported and educated in these or
phans’ homes. All over Africa the
missionaries have been buying little
negro children from their relatives
in order that these orphans may be
come the property of the mission
aries, and the objects of the charita
ble relief furnished by the orphan
ages. Right now, there is a call be
ing made through one of the strong
est denominational papers of this
country appealing to American Chris
tians to furnish money to buy “dear
little Dora”, a negro girl in Africa.
In the name of the God of our
fathers! how far is this ministering
to the heathen going to .carry us?
Have we any right to take the bread
out of the mouths of our ow or
phans, and carry it abroad to yellow
children, brown children and black
children? Have we any right to
neglect the sick, the afflicted, those
■who are in need of medical and sur
gical service in our own country,
and carry free medicine, and free
medical and surgical service to hun
dreds of thousands of destitute peo
ple of the Orient, of Mexico, of the
Antilles, of Central and South
America? Have we any moral right
to leave the destitute widows of our
own race to perish of want in our
great centres of population, while we
rake and scrape the congregations
of this country to get the funds
wherewith to build and to maintain
widows’ homes in Hindustan? Have
we any right—we of the Southern
States, disgraced with a percentage
of illiteracy that ought to make us
hang our heads in shame —to take
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
build, equip and operate secular
schools in Japan, China, India, Korea,
South America and Mexico? My
contention is that we have not.
The Bible itself says that “He
who provideth not for his own
household is worse than an infidel.”
Are not the people of one’s own
count ry, his national household?
Have we any right to do charitable
work abroad, so long as there is a
single little white girl or boy, or
white man or woman, who needs
our charitable assistance here in our
own household? It would be in
finitely better for the future of
America to devote these misapplied
funds to the uplift of the Africans
among whom we have to live, instead
of carrying them to the Congo Free
State, or to the West Coast of the
Dark Continent.
Here we all are, staggered by the
fact that the White Slave traffic has
reached such proportions that the
whole nation is aghast: a million
of our little boys and girls of ten
der years are being ground up into
dividends each year by remorseless
modern capitalism: the soft-drink
habit, the drug habit, the liquor
drinking habit, the obscene book
and picture are destroying the seed
corn of our race; and those whom
we are losing day after day, month
after month, year after year, be
cause we do not consecrate our
minds and hearts and purses for
the salvation of our own flesh and
blood, are worth infinitely more to
the future of civilization than all the
black, brown and yellow people on
the face of God’s earth.
It is my intense love for my own
people, and my profound sympathy
for the waifs and the estrays whom
we are neglecting, that makes me
assail the methods of modern mis
sionaries. They have departed from
the standards of Christ, they have
ignored the example set them by
Paul, Peter, Timothy and Barnabas.
The whole present system reeks with
salary-grabbing, and the laying of
such temptations before the greedy
eyes of the poorer classes of
heathendom that they are irresisti
bly drawn to embrace our religion
in order that they may share in the
loaves and fishes.
If you should publish, or otherwise
make known through the press, your
challenge to me, I trust, gentlemen,
that, out of the spirit of fairness, you
will also give to the papers this an
swer.
Very respectfully,
THOS. E. WATSON.
