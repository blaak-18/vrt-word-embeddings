Millionaire to
Explore the
Blue Nile
[Special Correspondence.]
St. Louis, Feb. 24.-St Louis people
are particularly interested in the cable
dispatches from England announcing
that an expedition to explore the source
of the Blue Nile river in remote north
east Africa will start from Abyssinia
before the end of next month, and that
the leader of the expedition is already
en route to the country of Menelek.
This leader is Mr. William Northrup
McMillan, a prominent young St. Louis
man, a millionaire who has long been
knoyrn as a devotee of Jungle hunting
and is not unknown to tame as an ex
plorer.
Mr. McMillan will take into Africa
one of the largest expeditions of recent
years. Like Stanley, he will carry
steel boats in sections, and when he
reaches the headwaters of the unex
plored Blue Nile he will launch these
boats and descend the river. A hun
dred camels will be required to carry
his equipment, and his caravan will be
a quarter of a mile in length.
The expedition was made possible
owing to the fact that the American,
who is only thirty years of age, is a
personal friend of the Abyssinian mon
arch. When Raes Makonnen, the noted
savage warrior, attended King Ed
ward's coronation as the representative
of Menelek, he bore with him an invita
tion to Mr. McMillan to visit Abyssinia
as Menelek's guest, and as an earnest
of good faith decoratedlthe St. Loui
saan with a gold medal that will insure
him protection while he is in the Ethi
Opian realm.
When the British government learn
ed that Mr. McMillan had decided not
only to accept Menelek's invitation,
but to utilize the opportunity to ex
plore the country whence came the
queen of Sheba ang rwhere King Solo
mon's mines were located, they imme
diately offered to have a gunboat
awaiting him at the juncture of the
Blue and White Niles. Their interest
in the matter was explained by the
fact that should the Blue Nile be found
navigable from its source to the White
Nile boats will be put on it to carry
British goods into Abyssinia, which is
a BlBttah protectorate. Mr. McMillaa,
who is bearing the whole expense of
the expe~diton, promptly accppoed the
rithish er, as the gunhoat will be

The mý: who were designed
to be the tfNtme captains, were all of
tender years when appointed, and,
without pmeparation, were sent 'on
board ships either fitting out or at-ut
to sail in sarch of the enemy. Yet the
need of mental education for the young
sters was geet, and fitful attempts
were made to provide it. Congress
having refused to establish a naval
a school; the navy department in 1802
prescribed in regulations the duties of
schoolmasters, but schoolmasters were
not appointed, writes ex-Secretary
John D. Long in Outlook. When, in
1819, the navy department decreed that
midshipmen must pass a professional
examination in order to receive pro
motion to the grade of lieutenant, the
country greeted the reform with grati
fication; the youths were affected with
consternation. It was the thing for a
"middy" during the greater period of
his apprenticeship to apply himself to
doing what he was told, and doing it
quick-a process which was frequently
accelerated by a rope's end-and to de
vote as much time as he could spare in
the six months prior to examination to
the study of the theory of seamanship.
This theoretical education was gained
from a few books on mathematics and
navigation and sometimes from the
kindly help of a superior. In "The
United States Naval Academy," writ
ten by Payk Benjamin, whose full and
excellent history of the Naval academy
I have followed, the author thus de
scribes the examination of Midshipman
Joseph Tatnall:
Commodore-Mr. Tatnall, what would
be your course, supposing you were off
a lee shore, the wind blowing a gale,
both anchors and your rudder gone, all
your canvas carried away, and your
ship scudding rapidly toward the break
ers?
Tatnall-I cannot conceive, sir, that
such a combination of disasters could
possibly befall a ship in one voyage.
Commodore-Tut, tut, young gentle
man! We must have your opinion sup
posing such a case to have actually oc
curred.
Tatnall - Well, sir, sails all carried
away, do you say, sir?
Commodore-Aye, all-every rag.
Tatnall-Anchor gone, too, sir?
Commodore--Aye, not an uncommon
case.
Tatnall-No rudder either?
Commodore-Aye, rudder unshipped.
(Tatnall drops his head despondingly
in deep thought). Come, sir; come,
bear a hand about it.' What would you
do?
Tatnall (at last and desperate)-Well, I
I'd let the infernal tub go to the deuce,
where she ought to gb!
Commodore (Joyouly) - Right, sir;
perfectly right! That will do, sir. The

CAPITA L
YARNS
and
INCIDENTS
[Special Correspondence.]
Washington, Feb. 23.-Aside from his
accomplishments as a financier and
story teller Secretary Shaw has devel
sped unexpected qualities as a shrewd
detective. He was over at the White
House the other day to call on the
president, and when he came out his
hat was nowhere to be found. Look
ing around he discovered one similar
to his own, though bearing in gilt let
ters on the inside the initials "T. C. P."
"Here," said Mr. Shaw to the by
standers. "is where I display the tal
ents of Sherlock
Holmes. Discov
ering the initials
'T. C. P.' in this
hat, I seek for a
man with those
initials who has
been at the

day. There is
only one such
man, and his
name is Thomas
C. Platt. That
does not prove
that the owner
of these initials
has taken my
hat, but when
we ascertain
that Mr. Platt
is not now at the
White House
the conclusion is
irresistible that
he has gone
away wearing a
hat. Since his
hat is here andk

has taken my hat. Is the demonstra

The bystanders admitted the clear
ness of the demonstration and compli
mented the secretary upon the subtlefy
of his reasoning and the accuracy of
his conclusions. Mr. Shaw then put
on Benator Platt's hat, walked over to
the treasury department and rang up
the senator on the telephone. Mtr
Platt admitted that he had a hat not
his own, but repelled any intimation
that he had purloined it, intimating
that if there had been any purloining
it might possibly be traced to the treas
ury department.
'This looks to me like a Wall street

"Sorry, sir, but the secretary ain't

"But I'm Representative Sulzer of

"Can't take your card in, sir."

In the matter of securing appoint
ments for his constituents Mr. Brown
low is most accommodating and suc
cessful. His constituents know this,
and he always has a long waiting
list of candidates for government
plums. He had an eye on the petition
of one of these folks for an office for
several years, and finally submitted
this man's name for an appointment
in connection with the cotton ginning
inquiries of the census.
As is customary in these particular
appointments, an agent was directed to
look into the man's standing and report
it there existed any reason why he
should not be appointed. This is the
agent's report:
"'Name, - -; recommended by Repre

reason, applicant dead two years."

"The senator from Indiana will ad

exclaimed Mr. Pettus sedately, looking
out over his heavy spectacles and
speaking in a thin, squeaky voice.
"I did address the chair," declared
Mr. B-veridge fervently and burning

with other senators. "I addressed the
chair twice.".
"I know the senator addressed the

in the same low, squeaky voice, which
emphasized the humor of the colloquy.
