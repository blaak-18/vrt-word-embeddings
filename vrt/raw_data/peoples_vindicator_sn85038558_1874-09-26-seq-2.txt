Bain in moderate quantities daring
the week. Cotton picking going
briskly on, the yield will not be much
beyond a half crop. Our labor better
than for some time, owing to the ab
sence of Radical office sekers, and
their attendant edb meetings and
barbecues. Colored people all say
that they feel already the good ef
lbfts.of,the white man's government,
which to them. is plenty to eat and
wear, and money in their packets at
the end of the year. All or nearly
all the lazy jury negtoes, who have
loafed around town for the- past six
years piekng up a precarious living
by begging, steaing and beingcauOht
on the jury, have gone to the cotton
fields and are the happy reeipients of
50 cents per hundred and fed, for
picking.
Fanaticism and Liberty.
We are rapidly approaching a cri
sisin the tide of government, the so
lution of which will be, whether we
are to have the liberty of the many
or the fanaticism of the few. We
dere called upon at the close of the
late war, to subscribe to certain ideas
of government which had, by force of
arms, become facts, and we were told
must be legislated upon, to make them
part and parcel of the 'implied spir
it" of the "constitution of our
fathers." We accepted all these acts
from the point of the sword, and
"made believe" that we did not see
the "arrow which was hid in the rose."
The 13th, 14th and .15th amend
ments to the Constitution ,wre offer
ed us, and we, in good faith, to secure
peace, and to enjoy the popular idea
of Liberty, gave them our support.
Reconstruction quick Tbllowed in the
train, and our model rulers suddenly
discovered that we were still rebel
lions, not fit for compatriots in the
Union, and that our love and vene
ration for American freedom must be
kept whetted with a display of armed
forces, and our enthusiasm for Ameri
can institutions pricked to life with
the point of the bayonet. This pill,
sugar-coated as it was, has been cram
med down our throats, not by reason
and argument, but by power, and for
six years our homes have reveled in
the damning attendants of recon
structed States-carpet-bag and seal
lawag thieves-brutal and insulting
negroes and the swaggering soldiery
ofbthe model 1lepblic.
We had begun fondly to imagine
that as all things must have an end,
that we, in the "order of things" were
approaching the, termination of our
troubles. But the death bed heritage
of' the sycophantic Sumner, the man
who living breathed to us nothing but
wrong and outrage, and dying, be
queathed to his followers all his bit
terness; must needs be engrafted in
the laws of the land to satisfy the
cravings of the fanatical shriekers of
the North. We are asked to surren
der to Legislation, and suds legisla
tion, the management of our social
affairs-regulations of. society fixed
by the hand of Nature's God, and as
immutable lp the hills, are to be
tamopered with by this vile herd in its
onward march to the destruction, not
only of government, but of our most
cherished traditions. This is the
point at which we have arri4ed anu
we must pull up. A limit exists to
all human affairs, and that is nature
itself. If it is imagined that, because
we have submitted to the destruction
of all the safeguards and barriers
which have surrounded us as a people
to be governed, we will allow this in.
vasion of our social structure, we will
submit for this wild Ciomwellian idea
to assume shape, and stalk armed
cap-a-pie into our domestic homes,
and that without resistance, is a coe
ful and eriminal mistake. "Is thy
servant a dog," that he should be
asked, ayes forced, to accept the de
gredation attending the Civil Rights
Bill. This is trying the temper of
our people entirery too far, and al
though we havie been just defeated in
a trial of arms with them, it must
not be forgotten that we are Ameri
cans, and what we are proader of,
the mabnly descendcnts of men.
Besides, what guarantee have we
that this will be the last demand
made even upon our society, although
we cannot conceive any thing more
degrading beyond this conceassion,
may we not look in time for a roll
gion to be foisted upon us, strictly
in keeping with their ideas, with the
Beacher "nest-hiding" plank as the
"salvation plan." Who can tell? for
is it not in "close communion" with[
this Forx-without-tail like crew.
The paritan idea of-liberty may
be, and is despotic, but they will al
low none other; their code of morals
and feelings of religion may not be,
and is not, in strict accord with thati
intended by (od, still it is theirs, "and
of such do they give unto usa."
Let us have an end of all this false
fear-the surrender of all that is
right and just, with the hope of ap
peasing the Northern demagogue.
We have yielded enough, if they in
sist upon an acceptance of all their
opinions, thenm we tIlU not do it tamely.
We reject fanaticism and will enjoy
liberty. Peace with oine and war
with the other. Let them elect vhieh
they should chLose.
The citisents of Nthitoehes par
ish had a Mass Meeting, immediate.
ly upon the receipt of tbhe news of
the surrender of Kellogg's govern.
ment, and quietly installed all the
MeEnery oilleers. No opposition has
been offered our demands, and the
colored peopie are joyful over. the
fact that the government of our par.
ish is in the hands of the real peolie.
The Feeling at the North.
This seems to be an inquiry made
by a majority of our people, and to
read through the files of the North
ern journals which come to us, leave
us much in doubt as to lproperly an
swer our interrogators. Confusion of
opinion seems confounded and the
entire matter of our coup d'etat is
looked at front partisan standpoints,
and judgment expressed accordingly.
It seems strange to see suchl journals
as the Sun, Tribune, MNissouri Iepubli
can, Chicag!o 'ijems andi others, ap
plauding our acts, and at the same
time saying it was "not the proper
way to solve our difficulties." We are
asked to appeal to "something" or
somebody else," and left to guess who
those things or persons are. We have
already appealed to the President, to
Congress and to the Northern people;
we asked the Interference of the Su
preme court, which informed us very
properly, that the matter was politi
cal and beyond the pale of th1 ju
risdietion; all these have turned a
deaf ear to our supplications, and we
are left to ourselves, told to solve the
difficulty among us, and when we do,
by the only means nature and law
have left us, the President interferes,
and we are told by such conservatire
journals as we have named, that we
"must not do that, its all wrong,"
"Rebellion will never be tolerated in
this country, &c., &e."
Has it ever struck these gentlemen
that we are in the same condition in
Louisiana precisely, and occupy the
same position that the American Col
onists did to the mother country. We
complain of grievances a thousand
times more monstrous than Boston
Port Bills or paltry taxes upon 'i'ea
and Stamped Paper. For eight years
have we borne this "taxation with
out representation ;" a pet idea of
New England statesmen it now seems,
and it is only intended as a maxim in
liberty when applied to their immac
ulate selves; and no petition, no re
monstrance, no supplication and no
prostration before the throne at Wash
ington, have called forth one manly
friend to arrest the tyranical hands of
the Radical governnent in the South,
backed by NVorthern sympathy and
headal by the scum of Northerw Society.
We have long since lost all hope of
redress; of even fair justice at their
hands. We will not keep back our
opinions in such times as these, we
will not fear to girA offence, a.t are
say to our ceuntrymen of the whole
Union and particularly of Louisiana,
in the language of Virginia's patriot
son. "There is no longer room for
hope. If we wish to be free-if we
mean to preserve inviolate those in
estimable privileges for which we
have so long contended-if we mean
not to basely abandon the noble strug
gle in which we have been so long
engaged, and which we have pledged
ourselves never to abandon until the
glorious object of our contest shall be
obtained-cc miset/yldt? An appeal
to arms and the God of hosts is all
that is left us." Upon us of Louisi
ana depend th9 fate of constitutional
government, all lovers of true liberty
in the Union will rally around our
standard, and we will gather in our
ranks those who will fight, aye die
for a Union of co-equal States,
the constitution of Washington and
Jefferson.
Latter*day
This class of indiyunals have, as
usual, upon the suneess of any move
ment, again loomned up, and they are
scenting the ,httle. from afer. Have
they forgotten that it was but yes
terday we were engaged in a death
struggle, and we searched in vain for
their presence in our ranks, do they
not remember it has been but a short
n~onth since we passed resolutions
deounoaclnaraa uaworthy of oer cons
idence and respect, all lndivlduals
who did not thle, array themselves
nupon the side of virtue and intelli
gence, against vice and ignorance.
If they have, etoe still remember.
It is useless to attempt to deceive
ns with this out-Heroding Herod
spirit of rejoicing, it comes with but
bad grace from such men, and cheap,
patriots are sot in demand. Mark
them fellow-citizens, and let them go
down to posterity as the 'Tories of
the Louisiana Revolution. llere Is
what we said of them in our Conveb
tion of the 15th of August last, and
fa fear some of them may foryet.it,
we will keep it standing at the head
of these columns.
Resolved rther, That the issue in.
volved, is, Stelligence and virtue, on
the one hand, and ignorance and vice
on the other, and we are, therefore,
constiaiqed to classify those white
men who support and affiliate with
the radical negro domination as ene
'lies to the white race and to the
prosperity of the commonwealth, and
they bshould be discountenaPced and
denounced by all good citizens as
unworthy their confidence and res.
pect.
Under Which King, Oh ! Israel.
We have not been able as a weekly
journal, to express our jby at the res
toration of the lawful people's gov
ernment in the State of Louisiana, to
give voice to the feelings of gladness
that must have pervaded the hearts
of all true patriots at the success of
our manly brothers in New Orleans in
overthrowing the base fraud that has
for the past two years, per force of
the bayonets of the Federal army,
ruled the destinies of this great State,
and now before an occasion does oc
cur, comes to us the startling news
that Grant has again interferod, and
this time in his sublime capacity as
militar ruler f of a once American le
p)nblic. No excuse of the order of a
Federal Judge, nought to relieve the
arbitrary act, it stands forth in bold
relief as the crowning consumation of
the first step in our alrance to a dic
tatorshlp, with Grant as the ruling
despot.
No reasoning can torture the situ
ation into anything else. The con
stitution fixes the limit for the con
duct of rulers, as well as the ruled,
and it was framed for the guidance
of one as well as the government of
the other, and when the chosen rep
resentative chooses to overstep the
written and implied basis of govern
ment, the ruled have the same right
to appeal to that doctrine which gave
birth to our Republic that our fore
fathers did.
No resistance was offered, save in
New Orleans, and that but momenta
ry, to the installation of the rightful
people's government; in all this
broad land not one drop of blood was
shed in the defence of officials cre
ated by fraud, against the demands
of the lawfully elected in 55 of the
56 parishes, and in a moment as it
were, the usurpation throughout Lou
isiana was a thing of the\past.
We ask the question, could this
Kellogg monstrosity have been a gov
ernment of the people's choice ? It is
answered! We want to hear no more
then of the claims of Kellogg's this,
or Kellogg's that. No matter what
step may be taken by M1cEery in
this matter, we of the country par
ishes demand and intend to inforce a
hearing. No Kellogg official shalll
ride orer us, this is our fied determi
nation, come what may.
The New Orleans Relpublican, N3os.
ton Courier aud iril. like journals, are
parading under ten-line headings, the
startling intelligence "that so many
negroes were killed in and around Con
shatta in the late fight, that the stench
fronm the dead bodies had driven those
living in that locality to the hills."'
All this is aews to Coushatta, as only
two negroes were killed or hung da
ring the whole excitement, and they
were decently buried. We of the
South, have no desire to kill negroes,
whom we consider harmless if let
alone, but we would like to have
enough of just such cowardly, lying
scoundrels, as the Editors of the Be
publican, Courier, Inter-Ocean and
that class down here, and we would
take pleasure in making not only the
citizpns living adjacent to the swamps
siel of the steneh of their dead bo
dies, but we would disgust even the
Alligators with their putrefaction.
This hatred shall not be one sided we
can assure themp. We are tired dis
proving your lies, you can go in and
tell them-but woe be unto you it you
should happen in coming time, to fall
into the hands of some North Lou
isianian. He'll be certain to make a
"swamp angel" of you.
SNo matter what shape may be gir
en to Kellogg and his government
over the eity of New Orleans, his nrle
over the counntry parishes is gone for
ever. The dominion of Carpet-bag
gers and their like brethren the Scal
taaig, I1 doomed--d'eal, we will say,
for all time to come, with us. Fede
raml troops, and in sufiient msabers
must quarter themselves among usna.
The edicts of Kellogg's courts will be
enforced only at the point of a Fede.
ral bayonet; and the ofllcials of that
defa~nto must executo his orders sar
rounded by ant armed guard of United
States soldiery. Albany Penitentia
ries-Dry Tortugas--easemated Forts,
have no terrors for us when compared
to the rule of thebo villainous blood
suckers who lately strutted in brief
authority in our midst. Louisiana
must be a garden or a desert.
We call attention to the fact that
Capt. Ferd. Cellos, with his stanach
light draught packet Bertha Brunner,
is making semi-weekly trips to the
falls at Alexandria, and return. Pas
sengers and freight pat through to
and from New Orleans in four dys,
without fail. This is high water
time, and we commend Capt. Cello.
to the consideration of our friends.
He rnns in connection with the Sin
not line.
Our Latest,
Packard has sworn in several hun
dred Deputy Marshal's.
Troops are moving from Xew Or
leans to the country parishes.
Kellogg makes no pretence of gov
erning.
The conference had their final in
terview, and closed their labors with.
out results.
The conference was to arrange for
a joint supervision and control of the
machinery of the November election.
Our people proposed that each party
should have two of the five, and the
four thus selected were to choose the
fifth who was to be of irreproachable
character, without regard to party
connections. This the Radicals posi
tively refused.
On the 19th, Kellogg, the what not,
surely no governor, was installed by
the United States troops. We have
now Grant's Government, and the
McEnery officials installed here will
give up only to the presence of the
United States forces. That this will
be followed in all the parishes, we do
not for a moment doubt. We have
too much pride in Louisianians to
suppose that they are afraid of paper
bullets; no matter how great the per
son may be who fires them. U. S.
Grant, the cheap hero of a war over
starved Southern soldiers, backed
now as then, by physical force, maIy
have terms for the moss-grown mis
creants who fled like curs to the
swamps in 1862, but to the Southern
patriot, who prefers death to dishon
or, they are but the sounding brass,
full of fury. signifying nothing., We
of North Louisiana must have aprac
tical demonstration of force before
we betray ourselves into the hands of
an enemy to be treated as we have
been. Our homes robbed, and our
liberties taken from as. If Myers,
Boullt, Blunt, and that ilk are to be
our rulers, President Grant, we ad
vise you to send 3000 Federal bayo
nets to install them, and after, you
must keep them here for all time, for
by the living God, naught but death
shall make us submit to their presence.
CoxrnoatsE.-Who, in God's name,
is the sickly individual who desires
to compromise with Kellogg at this
late day ? Does he, or they, imagine
that any patched up or doctored gov
ernment will satisfy the people, of
Louisiana. No, never--never ! We
naie eleccea our government in 18s2,
installed it in 1874, and if we can not
have that which has been chosen ac
cording to law, we want none of the
bayonet-civil abortions.
We proclaim now as in the begin
ning, that we were warring for prin
ciple, not men, nor will we surrender
one inch for policy. We are right or
we are wrong, and no intermediate
line can or shall exist.

We understand that several per

Proposed Convention.
Washington, Sept. 9.-An effort is
being made in this city to call toge.t her
the members of the Executive Con
mittee, to consider the propriety of
calling a qonvention of the democrracv
North and South to disclaim any sy(
pathy with the reported diso;dcrs in
the South.
WlI, we have said it, and this only
goes &o prove the correctness of the
stand made by those who favored the
White Man's party in Louisiana ; that
nothing had been done for us by the
National I)enlocrats. Now we g,
farther and say, nothing is crer to be
done by then+, for the South. Let ns
now understand the whole matter,
fully-fairly. We conceive it to b1,
as popular to abuse the Southern peo
ple, with the Northern Democrat as
it is with the Northern Republican,
and this palnering to the morbid
tastes and desires of the Yankee mob
for the smell of Southern blood, is as
much indulged in by one as the other.
The lapse of years frqm 1861 to 18714
have wrought no than e in the trans
Mason and Dixon line Democratic
politicians, and the ranks of the party,
those of Northern men with Southern
sympathizers, are full of Jim Lanes,
Daniel Dickersens. We will not long.
er be deceived by this false show of
maudlin sympathy, of the Northern
Democratic demagogue. Ours is the .
condition of the Lark in 2Esop's fable
of the Farmer. The work is before
us and we must do it ourselves.
"Honesta mnors turpi rita potior.'
The Revolution in the ParisLes.
By the many dispatches received
from the difierent parishes in the
State, it is clear that the Kellogg usur
pation has been completely and thor.
oughly overturned. The honest and
intelligent portion of the people are
now in possession of the local govern
ment. They are able to sustain the
position they have assumed, and w~
hope no paper orders from the Fed
eral Government will drive them from
their position.
We have fifty-seven parishes in this
State, and it will take a regiment of
Federal soldiers in each parish to
sustain in office the officials and ap
pointees of the Kellogg usurpation.
This will require 50,000 troops. Is
the Government prepared to quarter
that number of soldiers in Louisiana
to maintain in power a fraudulent and
infamous government f
It is true that we of New Orleans
have surrendered to Gen. Emory, not
because he was able to compel sub
mission, but because gunboats and
i other maeldoery of the U. S. Gov
ernment which might be used against
us woueald result in the destrupt¢on of
life and property greater than the
local interests of the city would justi
fy. But this, in itself, does not war
rant a surrender or submission to the
Kellogg usurpation in the country
parishes, until actual demonstration
of physical and armed forces by the
Federal Government, are exhibited to
such an extent that resistance would
be fruitless.
Let then every parish in the State
drive from office every usurper and
appointee of Kellogg and maintain
their position until overwhelmed by,
superior military force of Gran's gov
ernment. Compel him to send troops
in evey parish in the State, and thus
convince the world of the truthful
ness of the assertion that the Kellogg
usurpation cannot exist in Louisiana,
unless backed up by the army of the
United States.--N. O. Bulleti. .
The behavior of William Pitt Kel
logg, daring the traoublous days of
the recent rebellion, hasre not exalted
him in the estimation of his friends.
People naturally expects a Governor
of a State to maintain its dignity on
all occasions, and under all circum
stances. When last Monday morning,
fve respectable intelligent, unarmed
eitizens, called on him to request his
resignation, and he detailed an "of
flecer of hise staff" to meet them, re
fusing to see them himself, because
the arrangement had the appearance
of a "menace," it was thought by a
great many people that the respect
dne to the Governor, aud his oflee,
did not require suech a muifestation,
as no harm could have resulted from
the interview. Subsequent events
demonstrated that Mr. Kellogg cared
more for his own pemrsonal safy than
or-e digntle of his high offie, as
he left at once dbr the Customm-HIouse,
and has not been heard of sinoe, ex
cept by way of the demoeretie papers.
'He has. iased no proclamation, de
nooncing the illegal organization that
overCun the city, or calling on the
people for their support in maintain
lg the government of the State. Hid
in the Custotms-House, he cannot be
found except by a reporter for a demo
cratic paper who must have brass
enough to interview the CardiffGiant.
It is the ope and wish of almost tl:e
entire community of every eolor or
class that he may never be returned
to a place whose dignity and respect
ability be hasm been entirely unable
to maintain. They prefer a military
Governor,--La 8tate Register.
"The people," who have so sum
marily revolutionized the Govern
ment of this State comprise, if not a
majority of the voters, a large major
ity of the wealth, influence, and so
cial position. If Mr. Penn could re
main Governer, they would all be
satisfied. With MeEnery at the head.
ofaffairs alarge number will not be
pleased. With Kellogg restored to
power, they will all be naited against
him, as also a very respectable por
tion of the republican party who have
heretofore sustained him.-La State
