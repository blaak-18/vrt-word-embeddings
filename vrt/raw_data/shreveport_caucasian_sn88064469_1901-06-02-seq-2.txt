The odder the design of the fireplace

Women Should Seek Relief.
The creat proportion of women who suffer never make a serious effort to benefit I
the.'selves. TThe most of them go on paying no attention to their little menstrual
dis;er:'.ers, believing they will eventually wear off. But menstrual troubles don't wear
off. They :row worse and worse every day. At the period of menstruation a woman
is peculiarly susceptible to cold and other external influences and it is also the most
favorable time for the development of hidden disease germs which may be lurking in
the sv.tcm. Any physician knows that disordered menstruation, falling of the womb
[ :.: izcorrhoea are blighting lives in almost every home. No woman should neglect
h.irseif a moment after she sees indications of female disease. Almost instant relief
can be secured by the use of
WINE0oCARDUI
It will relieve you right in your own home. Will you accept the testimony of Mrs.
Dei.ler and thousands of other women and really seek relief today? All druggists
sell $1.00 bottles of Wine of Cardui.
100 Chicago Street, Fort Wayne, Ind., March 27, 1900.
Your Wine of Cardui has done a world of good for me. I have used five bottles of the Wine and one package of Thedford's Black
Draught. And since I have started to use it I will not be without it in the house. It helped my sister in Toledo, who did not menstruate as
she ought. She was sixteen years of age and nothing helped her. I was in a very bad state myself before I used your medicines, but I found
relief in three days. And now I feel like a new woman and do all my housework and washing, which I could not do before I took the Wine of
Cardui. I would be very g!ad to write any poor woman and tell her how I suffered before I used Wine of Cardui Mrs. C. P. BEIGLER.
