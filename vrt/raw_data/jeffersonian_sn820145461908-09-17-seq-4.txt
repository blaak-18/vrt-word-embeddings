PAGE FOUR
The "Dependent Party” in Atlanta
Friday night transpired the last
notification of the last Vice-Presi
dential nominee of his selection as
assistant standard bearer of his
party—namely, our friend John
Temple Graves.
After Mr. Clapp had duly felicitat
ed the audience upon their privilege
to be there and congratulated him
self upon his magnificent array of
hearers, there came forward a
creature who has become famous as
Hearst’s lawyer, Clarence Shearm
This little baldheaded being, dapper
and slick, commenced upon his noti
fication oration, which didn’t fit the
occasion, somehow, Brisbane must
have got the speeches mixed. Also
it was the frankest expose of the
by-path by which all dissenting De
mocrats are sought to be led into
the Taft band-wagon.
Bi-metalism? That was a ridicul
ous thing in which the South had
never believed! “Oh, that night
mare of free-silver! ’ ’
The tariff? Louisiana wanted pro
tective tariff on sugar; Kentucky arid
North Carolina wanted it on tobacco,
South Carolina on cotton goods,
Tennessee on coal, Alabama on steel,
etc. So far as tariff for revenue only
was concerned, of course Mr. Shearn
said nobody in the South really
wanted it.
Expansion ? Certainly we must
have expansion; and obviously we
must have a navy to follow it up.
What fatuous folly in anyone to op
pose an increase in the navy!
Those were the economic reasons,
according to Mr. Shearn, why the
South should go into the Indepen
dence League. True, the platform
of his party would appear to be anti
the policies of the Republicans—
diametrically opposed to them —but
Mr. Shearn was, by some strange
oversight in apparently getting his
speech confused with something he
must have intended to deliver in the
privacy of his committee room,
giving the whole insincere scheme
away.

The Rome date of Sept. 25th has been canceled. Mr. Watson speaks at
Powder Springs on that date.
A regular schedule of Mr. Watson’s speeches will be printed in the Jef
fersonian during the campaign, and every voter in Georgia will be given an
opportunity to hear him.
Politically, he said, there were
reasons why the South should not go
Democratic and, he soothingly added,
“Os course w eknow why you cannot
afford, with your local conditions, to
go into the Republican party.” He
paid perfunctory tribute to some
Southern statesmen, after the fashion
of one who has been told to say over
certain names, and contrasted these
with the present controllers of the
/Democratic party —the Murphys,
Ryans, Belmonts, - McCarrens —but
never a word of the criminals who*
control the Taft crowd. And present
ly Mr. Shearn butted in and said
“you have such lead!e[rs as Joe
Brown,” which was more than the
audience could stand and it suddenly
became a human tornado in full
action. Yells of “Brown, Brown,
little Joe Brown!” “Go back to New
York —we don’t need you here,” etc.,
made a riot of sound for many
minutes, during which the small
creature stood, nonplussed at the
storm his sally into State politics had
created. The rest of his speech was
delivered, but he was so clearly
rattled that the effort was painful
until he reached the point in his
“piece” where he said of Yancey
Carter “we, in New York, love him
as well as you do here,” at which
there was such genuine mirth in
certain quarters that the tension was
somewhat relieved. However, Mr.
Shearn misnamed poor Mr. Hisgen
“Hillyer” in his wild embarrassment
and it was a welcome end when, in a
final blurt, he “popped the question”
to the nominee.
Mr. Graves, of course, received a
glad hand. Not an ovation, but the
kindly applause of many personal
friends who were present purely as a
compliment to their former fellow
townsman and associate. His ad
dress was, as anticipated, an excellent
example of rhetoric, but he was
either physically fagged or mentally
disheartened. What of his speech
could be clearly heard was pleasing,
but weak. _
TJeffersonlan
At the close, the great “Tribune
of the People, William Randolph
Hearst” took possession of the
boards. Huge of body, with & small
head, William R. looked like an
ungainly school boy and his “speech”
was a “copyrighted” affair, which
he had not had time to learn by
heart. He essayed to give the reasons
for the faith that is in (?) him, but
he did not know these well enough to
say them right off without stopping
to refer. Those who had expected at
least a commanding personality and
a crisp, business-like talk upon the
plain issues of the day, were keenly
disappointed. There is in him not
the vestige of anything going to
promise leadership—a hulking fellow,
with money enough to buy brains.
Were he bankrupt tomorrow, there is
not one of his following who would
say “Take of my means; lean on my
strength until you regain your own.”
Mr. Hisgen was very ordinary and
none too grammatical. Altogether,
the play was obviously a farce.
Had these people been honest in
their wish for true reform, they knew
where to get it, for the white light
of Jeffersonian Democracy has been
held aloft by the Populists for many
years.
Only a brief four years ago did
John Temple Graves upbraid our
leader for not “getting his reforms
inside the Democratic party.” Hav
ing since admitted that we were right
in finding no reforms could be
achieved within that corrupt old
amalgamation, he would have been
fairer to himself and the South which
he professes to love had he refrained
accepting this last asignment of his
editor-in-chief, which apparently
makes his none to happy in carrying
out and can further no good end.
The police of Atlantic City declar
ed their belief that Charles B. Rob
erts could clear the mystery as to
who shot him. He is on the road to
recovery and soon will be put through
the “third degree.”

My Comrades:
Tom Watson is on the wing dissem

ties of this honorable appointment.
With you abetting me, I hope, with
God’s help, to induce multitudes to
join our patriotic hosts in the mighty
struggle to protect our homes, to pre
serve our racial purity and to win
back our lost liberties.
Will one or more true men in each
county ready to help, write me at
once. Get to work, boys, get to work.
Your friend and brother,'
F. D. WIMBERLY.
