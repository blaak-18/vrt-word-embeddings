Joseph Dupuis died at I :4o a.

near Carencro. Mr. Dupuis was a
most estimable gentleman. He was
born 64 years ago in this parish
where he has always lived a life
characterized by uprightness, never
failing to perform his duties toward
his family and country. He served
valiantly during the civil war, hav
ing been a member of Company A.,
7th Louisiana Regiment. He was
an industrious farmer and worked
hard to provide for a family of six
children, all of whom are living.
In his death the parish loses one of
its oldest and best cilizens, one
whose life was above reproach and
who didl his duty in peace and in
war. Peace to h's ashes!

The Election.
The election to choose a mayor
and seven councilmen for the town
of Lafayette was held last Monday.
As there was pratically no opposi
tion to the regular Democratic
ticket it had a leal walK-over. The
faction defeated at the mass meet
ing held at the court-house centered
all its opposition against Judge A.
J. Moss and Judge O. C. Mouton
and on election day a desperate ef
fort was made to secure the politi
cal scalps of these two gentlemen.
A ticket was formned o9 of the re
gular ticket with the exception of
Judge Mo.s whose name was re
placed by that of Mr. Wmi. Clegg
and Dr. Tolson's name was printed
in the place of Judge Mouton's.
In justice to Mr. Clegg and Dr.
Tolson we will state that their
names were used without any au
thorization from them. They sup
ported the regular ticket and were
ignorant of the fact that they were
candidates. It may not be amiss
to state also, that several persons
who were known to be opposed to
the ticket before and at the nomi
nating convention, cast their ballots
openly for the whole ticket, but
thosejwere evidently in the minority,
as is clearly shown by the vote re
ceived by Mr. (Clegg and Dr. Tol
son. The fight was made against
Judge Moss and Judge Mouton, but
the opposition was not strong
enough to defeat them. They went
in by a large n3majority, The fol
lowing is the vote:

Runaways.
Robt. Bailey borrowed Sigis
mond Bernard's horse and buggy
and drove to the depot but he had
to come back afoot. The horse
ran away and Bob was compelled
to jump out of the buggy, which he
did just in time escape unhurt. The
buggy was pretty badly damaged
before the horse was stopped.
Henry Hohorst's horse made
things look rather lively around the
depot the other day. He took
fright and started to run like a
scared wolf. The buggy which he
was pulling collided against another
buggy and a gig, resulting in con
siderable damage to the chree vehi
cles.
An Epileptic.
H. Billaud, who went as far as
Cheneyville with the gang of con
victs, stated to The Gazette reporter
that the white man, Joe Domingue,
who was sentenced to 8 months for
larceny, is subject to epileptic fits
and had a severe attack on the
cars. Mr. Billaud says that the
poor man suffered very much, hav
ing been a sufferer from this disease
for many years.
A Bridal Party.
Thos. S. Adams, Jr., and his

Last Saturday a negro called at
the home of Victor Couvillon near
Carencro, and offered to sell a horse
for r$2.oo. Mr. Couvillon, sus
pecting that the horse had been
stolen, hastened to Carencro and
told Judge 0. P. Guilbeau of his
suspicions. Judge Guilbeau, accom
panied by Mr. Couvillon, went in
pursuit of the negro and soon had
him under arrest. Sheriff Brous
sard was telegraphed for and he
promptly proceeded to Carencro
and brought the negro to town and
jailed him. Monday morning One
zime.Dronet came to town and
stated to Sheriff Broussard that a
horse and saddle had been stolen
from him Saturday last, and to his
surprise the sheriff produced the
horse which Mr. Dronet recognized
as the one stolen. It appears that
the negro, whose name is Joseph
Phillips, is a notorious rascal, to
whom a term in the penitentiary
can not fail to prove beneficial to
his health if not to his morals.

iThe Cosmlonwealer in Fiction.
Miss Adlcline Knapp, well known as onle
of the cleverest women writers on the Paci
fic coast, has put the comnmonwealer of
Coxey's army into fiction, as in a story
called '"'The 1Vealer," which appears in the
May Arena. It is a very suggestive com
mentary, not upon the fantastic Coxcy
movemnent, Iut upon existing industrial atndl
social conditions.
As an analysis of the origin of much of
the shocking crime that daily fill the nIews
papers, it suggests that there are Cains in
our midst who never shed bilood, but simply
kill hope and opportunity.
Everybody who readls Miss Knapp's story
carefully will bie impressed with its lidclitv
to the asipects of every-day life, andil its great
power of suggesting all thie compllex forces
of society in a simplle sketch of indlividual
experience. In Miss Knapp we have a inew

A Foolish Demonstration.
Thursday morning a "stuffed
man" was found hanging to the
telephone wire on Lincoln avenue.
On one side were written the follow
ing words: ,"King John, died May
6th, at 7 o'clock," and on the other
side appeared the following: "Plant
sweet flowers on my political grave.
Czar." No words should be too
strong to condemn this demonstra
tion, and The Gazette regrets that
those responsible for it have so far
forgotten themselves as to indulge
in such a ridiculous thing. It is
right and natural that men should
rejoice over a political victory; but
let the rejoicing be done in day
light and above board. This effigy
hanging done in secrecy will never
meet with favor as it can be pro
ductive of good to no one.
Nobody is happier than The Ga
zette over the result of the last mu
nicipal election and it will not try
to conceal its joy, but as a newspa

if it did not express its disapproval
of such proceedings.

Referring to the old carpet-bag
regime and of the extravagance of
the negro "statesmen," Mr. E. B.
Andrews says in Scribner's:
Republicans from the North
flocked to the South, whom the
blacks, viewing them as represent
ing the emancipation party, naturally
welcomed and followed. There
were honest carpet-baggers, no
doubt, but most such were idealists,
little likely to reconcile the races,
nearly certain to be misled by their
shrewd but unprincipled colleagues.
The good and the bad alike did
their best to inflame the negro's
sense of independence and to en
gage him in politics. His former
wrongs were dwelt upon and the
ballot held up as a providential
means of righting them. The negro
was too apt a pupil. In their days
of serfdgm the negroes' besetting
sin had been thievery. Now that
the opportunities for this were mul
tiplied, the fear of punishment gone,
and the carpet-bagger at hand to
encourage it, the prevalence of
public and private stealing was not
strange. The colored legislators
of South Carolina furnished the
statehouse with gorgeous clocks at
$480 each, mirrors at $750, and
chandeliers at $650o. Their own
aparitments were a barbaric display
of gewgaws, carpets and upholstery.
The minority of a congressional
cominitte recites that "these ebony
statesmen" purchased a lot of im
ported china cuspidors at $8o
apiece R'hile senators and represen
tatives "at the glorious capital of
he nation" had to be "content with
a plain earthenware article of do
mestic manufacture."
