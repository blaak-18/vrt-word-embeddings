IN MEMORIAM O"
E. L. B. r.
BY W. C. J.
Ah! why was thy staying so brief!
[ Why destined so noon for the tomb!
As the dewdrop that hangs on the leaf,
Or the snowflake that falls fron it's home.
The bnruised heart in sorrow will mourn,
And the spirit in anguibh he bowed,
When the lund from the bosom is torn,
But a rainbow hangs high on the ele'd.
Tho' the Angel of Death may pass by,
For a mounent it only can sever,
Then ele from the tear and the sigh,
SFor ' is not a Farewell foirev.
S:T, bear but a short sinless . t,
It's frail span of beiun was vaen,
It laid it's sweet claims on the heart,
And. enthr-ret rued back to.heaven.'
We may weep, but Gad's jueginents are
just.
He only culled hack what he gave,
And Angels shall 'watch o'ir its dust,
I l'i)l it rises in life frout the grht'e.
Look upward, in faith firm relying,
It's sweet smiles, again yousball share,
Where grief brings no :mouruin or
sighinng,
And sorrow no more drops a tear.
Rest baby, in llhy slunmber so dpep,
Rest on, 'till to time,-rest is given,
Then wake from thy mounhlering sleep,
And rest-rest forever in heaven.
Mob Law in the South.
One of tile evils resulting from the
introlduction ofthle race question into
Ipolitics, in tlhose of the r~tsmnatineted
Stattes which have a manjority 'ld color
ed voters, is the iinpossihility, of oh
tailiillg justice in the courts where an
offender against the law is a negro
andi his accner a white matn. In Mis
sissilppi, where tie most abandoned'
chal'acters have ben, placeed in official
lelsitioins giving tl;hel power to con
trol the aelCtioln of grandjuries, and in
nilany parts of .Louisiana, it is au I ut
terly hopleless uindertaking to secure
the lpunishment of any negro, eicep)t
in very. race cases, who has been
guilty of a crime against a white cit
izen. The klejudice againtt color is
very powetuil with the average une
groi juror.
It is a natural consequence of such
a state of affairs that citizens who
have been robbed, or wham find that
they have murderers anagng them,,
knowing that they can olbt.in no re
dress or protection from the courts,
should somietimes take the law intoi
their own hands. Such proceedings
are to be condemlnned, for lyilhers are
lit discriminaiiting in regard to ev
idence, and there is always danger
that innocent men may ftll tims to
the Iureaaonuilng fury of an exclted
mob. And yet, when tie) provoca
tionls are considered, ;t will seem
rather remairkable than otherwise to
those who are familiar, with the pre
selit condition of the Africanized
States tiat so few issies of mob law
occur in cormm imities which are sys
tematically rolled by midusight pil
ferers, and in which the discovery of
plots to mniu der and burur are not of
unfrequent occurrelnce.
The res,ent tragedy in Clinton, Lou
isiana, ';eas a direct result *,f a state
of thi':ags for which thoeprepent rulers
of tl.at State are tliiety responsible.

O'a.trage occurred, tile white citizens

pletely at the mercy of tire negros,
who hold all thoi most ilmportant local
offices. The .taxation there is 300 and
400 per cent greater than .before the
war; the juries are usually;, composed
of the most ignorant plantation ie
gres ; and their hatred of thile whites
Is so great thant the latter have no
possiblle chance of obtaining juatice
inl the courts. There was. receunti3 a

John Gair, a .notld e.olored,'io.litieian

on his way to Clinton under guard. lie

and the woman was hanged by the

But tihe little peddler was so ex

Tmim RUDIMENTS OF PHILADELPHIA
JocRNALISM.-A Chicago paragraph.
iiti wiho had got a place on a Phila

his new proprietor: "Of course, you
know our Philadelphia papers are dif

have to be. You must be a little

that you come from the West, the

Don't pitch into any body-that is,
any body who is alive now, or who
has died within sy, .500 years;adon't
even say any thing harsh of Mr.
Richard Turpin, for there are some of
our subscribers who go so far as to
admire him. No man .of genius, no
matter how mean he was in private
life, most he ridiculed in our paper,
for our people love great men and
always stop their papers when they
see any tlint, against ,their hero.s.
Why, we lost't forty-three subscribhers
ontle day by a harmless little paragtrapli
on that old humbag, Wajt. Penn. By

The Farm Laborer and Grange.
It is 'a mistaken idea thiat the only
person eligible to membership in the
grange is the farmer who both owns
and tills his land. The man. 'who
makes agricumlture his business, though
he does not own t single rood of
earth, is jest s eligibhle as the man
who owns a tllousand acres. Tihe
eonstitution says that an applicant.
for mnlembership must be "engaged in
agricultural pursuits, and have no
interest in conflict rith our purposes."
The constitution does not say that. he
must own tihe land he tills, lie must
4be engaged in agricultural pursuits.
The emiploye on the farm, knowan as
the "hiired man," is entitled to mem
bership as far as agriculture is con
cerned ; and if lie toils upon the farm
all the time, how can lie lhare an in
terest in conflict with our purposes?
Qf course the employe ought to be a
mhan of gomid halittm, and one that can
le trusted. With these qualificeations,
Goda forbid that anmything like casute or
strata in Society sialt keel hin tin out.
