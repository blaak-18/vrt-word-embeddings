NOTES.
People in New York city have an
opportunity these days to eat kanga
roo meat.
-or*
St. Petersburg, Russia, is still in the
clutch of cholera, notwithstanding the
cold weather, and the death rate aver
ages five a day.
It is reported that over 2,000 China
men are in arms by reason of the riot
ing which has grown out of the pro
hibition of opium poppy planting
around Amoy, China. The Chinese
government is doing its utmost to
stamp out the opium evil, but many
growers of the poppies naturally feel
keenly the hardship of being prevent
ed from raising the crop upon which
they have depended for a livelihood.
Their refusal to be bound by the pro
hibitory order resulted in much dis
turbance.
The wardrobe of an English judge
costs from $2,500 to $3,000, and, in
ease he is appointed to the King’s
Bench division, he will require “five
gowns, a girdle, a scarf, a easting
hood, a black cap, a three-cornered
cap, a beaver hat, a cocked hat, a silk
hat, lace bands and two full court
suits, with swords, etc.” Vanity of
women, quail before such an array of
fluff and flub-dud, flounces and furbe
lows. And ye husbands and fathers,
ponder on the number of “Merry
Widows” and directoire gowns which
may be purchased for $2,500, and then
gladly hand over the price of one or
two of these feminine glories.
At the last State election in Maine,
that far Eastern State incorporated
the initiative and referendum in her
fundamental law. Hereafter, no law
may go into effect until ninety days
after its signature by the Governor,
during which period a petition of 10,-
000 qualified voters will refer it to
the people if there be objection to the
law. This will stay the operation of
the law until the next.general election,
when it will be subject to the will of
a majority vote. If, after signature,
by the Governor, no objection is raised
in thirty days, the law stands. This
is not the only means by which the
people may rule, however. Provided
12,000 petitioners ask the Legislature
to pass any desired measure, it must
be introduced. If the Legislature re
jects iit, the people may demand a
referendum at the next general elec
tion, and a majority of the voters
can then make it a law over the heads
of the legislators.
Missouri is rapidly getting out of
the class of those who have to be
“showed” and is showing others. Re
cently she adopted the initiative and
referendum, week before last drove
the Standard Oil and its allied com
panies out of the State, as well as
fining them $50,000 apiece, and now
is busily at work grinding on the
litigation in the hearing of the rate
case which involves eighteen railroads
operating in the State. This is the
case in which the railroads concerned
are attacking the two-cent passenger
and maximum freight rates as “con-
fiscatory.” The result of the hearing
will be most important, coming on, as
it does, immediately following the Vir
ginia decision in which the Supreme
Court threw out the railroads from
the Federal courts, on the constitu
tional opinion that if they had remedy
against the two-cent rate, it must be
sought in the State courts and no 'ap
plication to higher Federal authority
be allowable until the resources of the
State had been exhausted.
THE SONG OF THE SIREN.
It was dark and dark and dreary
And the air was limp and chill,
And a blackness, dire and leery.
Compassed mead and moor and hill,
And a silence, like a token
Os the dead, was only broken
By the wind that moaned and whistled
as it shook my window sill,
By the wind that wailed and whistled
as it surged and ceased at will.
In my chamber, lighted only
By the fire-light’s tender glow,
Long I sat, alone and lonely,
While the flames played to and fro.
O’er my sorrow sadly thinking,
Slow my soul was sinking, sinking,
’Till at last I sought nepenthe in the
golden long ago,
Mingled memories sweet nepenthe
with the bitter dregs of woe.
Wrapt in silent retrospection
Os my childhood days gone by,
Many a fond, fond recollection
Passedebefore my fancy’s eye,
And these memories senescent,
Like a sunbeam iridescent,
Lit the pathway of my sorrow, hushed
my sad soul’s plaintive cry;
Lit the valley of my sorrow, stilled
, my soul’s despairing sigh.
O could I but only linger
Where these fragrant memories blend
With the sunshine! But the finger
Os my fate has marked the end,
For I hear the Siren singing
And the threnody is' ringing
Clear and sweet above the sighing and
the moaning of the wind,
Sweet and clear above the moaning
and the sighing of the wind.
Ah, no more with love’s emotion
Shall my heart in triumph swell,
And no more with true devotion
Shall my lips love’s secrets tell,
For the Siren’s calling, calling,
And the shadows fast are falling,
Fast are falling o’er the meadows
where the nodding daisies dwell,
Fast are falling over meadow, over
dale and over dell.
—M. E. Evans.

KAFFIR CORN IN THE SOUTH.
That Kaffir corn and milo maize
are not properly appreciated in the
feed trade is the conclusion of the
Texas station in a feeding test. These
grains contain considerably less fat
or oil than Indian corn and in other
constituents the differences are not
important. The protein and fat of
Kaffir corn are much less easily di
gested than the same constituents in
Indian corn. In a feeding test the
Kaffir corn produced greater gains
than milo maize with Indian corn in
third place.—Nashville Banner.

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. Itjhas every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
worth their weight in gold.
