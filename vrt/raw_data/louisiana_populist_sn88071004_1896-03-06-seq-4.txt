March
April, May are most emphaticall3 the
months for taking a good blood purifier,
because the system is now most in need
of such a medicine, and because it more
quickly responds to medicinal qualities.
In winter impurities do not pass out of the
body freely, but accumulate in the blood.
April
The best medicine to purify, enrich and
vitalize the blood, and thus give strength

Why He Did Not.
A son of Paul Verlaine, the late
French poet, tells a strange story in
explanation of his failure to attend his
father's funeral. Some months ago he
arrived in Brussels from Algeria and
was about to start for Paris, when he
suddenly fell into a lethargic sleep,
which lasted four days. The same
state has come upon him again, the
last attack being at the time of his
father's funeral. Dr. Van Vensel, of
Brussels, has given young Verlaine a
certificate, stating that these sleeping
spells are due to the hypnotic influence
of a man whom he met in Algeria.
A Maacule Woemsa
Delna, the present star of the Opera
Comique in Paris, is a very fat young
woman who has a mustache and a very
redundant figure. She is described as
looking as if she never washed her
face and almost never combed her
hair. Her voice is bad and her dra
matic knowledge limited, but she is a
success. Four years ago she was
singing in a cafe chantant of not par
ticularly good character. She might
be scrubbed up a little, put in very
evening dress, and become a fad in
New York.
Wanted to Ask Mamma.
An actress created quite a sensation
at Racine, Wis., the other day by sud
denly postponing her marriage. All
the arrangements for the ceremony
were complete and she was about to
proceed to the church when she sud
denly concluded that it would be nec
essary to ask mama. A good deal of
free advertising has resulted.
Am Old Suit.
A case is now before the courts of
Bavaria, which has been in litigation
for 301years. It is the suit of the
town of Burglnn against the lords of
Thungen for 2,000,000 marks, value of
a certain forest of oaks. It is holped
that the case will be finally settled on
the 21st of next June.
Dog ab aegg.
The egg of the dog fsh is provided
with a system of spiral cables like the
tendrils of climbing plants. These
feelers reach out Ia every direction,
and whenever they encounter an ob
ject which they can seize, twine them
selves around it and hold the egg in
position until it is hatched.

The accident to the steamer Missoula
e tends to show more cl'arly than any,
thing that nas occurred the vast area
of Lake Superior, and the possibility of
a vesmel's crew reaching land after
shipwreck, and yet being unheard of
for a couple of weeks after starting or
a voyage, says the Detroit Free Pres:s
Th, shores of Michigan, Wisconsin and
Minnesota on the big lake are traversed
g by reiltrays and telegraph lines, and
' the towns and small settlements on the
American side of the lake, even to the
islands, furnish ready means of commu
nication with the larger cities, but not
a so on that part of the Canadian shore
g north of the lakes, where a wilderness
Inhabited by a few fishermen and In
diana exists. This is especially true of
r the Canadian shore just above Sault Ste.
r Marie, and for a long stretch of country
a to the north and east of the point where
a the Canadian Pacific Railway turns it,
to the shore of the lake and traverses it
t on toward Port Arthur and Fort Wil
liam.
When the Missoula broke her shaft
and was rendered helpless, she was less
than twenty-five miles from Caribou
island. on the course down toward Sault
Ste. Marie. She was somewhat off the
regular course of vessels bound down
I from the head of Lake Superior, but if
she had been able to make any headway
o toward the Sault, or care for herself at
all on the course she was following.
she would have been picked up very
soon after the accident by some passing
vessel. But a southerly wind drifted her
out of the course of even the few vessels
trading to Canadian ports at the head
at the lakes, and she was working over
toward the wildest part of the Canadian
north shore territory when her crew
were compelled to abandon her.
A glance at the chart will show that
d Brule point, where the crew of the Mis
n soula first made land, is scarcely more
than seventy-five miles from Sault Ste.
Marie, where 15,000,000 tons of freight
passes through a canal in a single sea.
d son, and yet the men in one of the Mis'
e soula's yawl boats spent nearly two
a days working along the shore of the
I, lake before they found any more sign
. of life than a deserted fisherman's
g. shanty, in which they built a fire and
a dried their wet clothing. The fishing
season had closed, but even fishermen
are scarce in this territory durirg the
most active periods. It is not strange,
therefore, that the men from the MIs
soula were nearly a full week in finding
means of communicating with the own
ers of the vessel after they had landed
on the dreary north shore of Lake Su
perior.
OOINO POR THE DEVIL.

Upen ML satsanl Majesty.
From the Portland Oregonian: The
Oreonian is in receipt of a pamphlet
entitled "A Jab at the Devil; an Argu
ment fto a Christlan Political Party,"
by Rev. Wallace R. ftruble, evangelist.
It is printed at Colon, Mich., where Mr
Btruble is at present "evangelslang.'
On the eover is a picture of his atanto
majesty, seated on the base of a column,
aroand Which oae of his arms is placed.
He. weas a pained exprsslon of coun
tenPace, and has two cloven bet and no

gat style, while a large, healthy-look
l n black snake, ornamented with red
spots Sad a barbed tall, lies across his
lap and encircles the pillar, Its mouth
being in the act of seaiing a spear. This
spear Issues front a black corner of the
- cover, ornamented by a number of death
heads, where Mr. Struble is supposed to
be hidden in ambush, eadeavoring to
Jab the spor Into the devil's thorax.
"The author's countenance" forms a
frontisplece for the pamphlet, and from
his sleek, wedll fed appearance it is evi
dent that Rev. M. Struble, though in
Michigan, is enjoying life much better
than the party he is jabbing at In an

"THE WOODEN HEN."
,t We have heard of wooden horses and
wooden ducks, but a wooden hen is
a something new under the sun-and its
purposes are different from those of
either of the other wooden animals
mentioned. It is a not a toy, though it
will please a boy. It is a hen, at least
it will hatch chickens from hens' eggs.
If
It is 10xl15x Inches and will take care
of twenty-eight eggs. It is an incu
bator and costs only $6.00.
a This wooden hen is made by George
H. Stahl, Quincy, Ill. If you want to
find out more about it before you buy
one write to Mr. Stahl for catalogue
"W." which gives a full description, and
mention this paper.

Gladness Comes
iW th a better understanding of the
transient nature of the many phys
ical ills, which vanish before proper ef
forts-gentle efforts-pleasant efforts
rightly directed. There is comfort in
3 the knowledge, that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis
ease, but simply to a constipated condi
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt
ly removes. That is why it is the only
a remedy with millions of families, and is
lI everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that itis the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness without debilitating the
organs on which it aets. It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene
ficial effects, to note when you pur
chase, that you have the genuine arti
cle, which is manufactured by the Call
fornia Fig Syrup Co. only and sold by
all reputable druggists.
Iftin the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, laxatives or
other remedies are then not needed. If i
afalicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the most skillful
I- physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
one should have the best, and with the
well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.
