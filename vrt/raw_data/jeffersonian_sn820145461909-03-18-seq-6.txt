ZA/ZERJ FHpM THE PEOPLE
AN “OLD DOMINION” POPULIST
SUBMITS REORGANIZA
TION PLAN.
Stanardsville, Va., March 1, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Dear Sir: I note from the Review
of Reviews that you received 105 votes
in Virginia at the last presidential
x election—more than were polled by
the Populist ticket in either of the
two previous campaigns (1900 and
1904). The fight for Populist princi
ples should be kept up. Let me sug
gest a few details.
There should be a national con
ference soon, to bring all reformers
together and to determine the plan of
campaign during the next three years,
as preparatory to the national cam
paign for President in 1912. But
there ought to be preliminary cam
paigns for closer organization in each
State first. Organize each State sepa
rately, then call a national conference
to settle definitely those questions that
State conferences may bring to the
front.
If you, Mr. Watson, could arrange
an itinerancy covering the States
where Populism is still alive, so that
there -would be but a day or two be
tween the dates set for a conference
or mass meeting in any two States
(to allow time for traveling), some
thing definite could be learned about
the actual situation confronting the
reformers in each State. Your tour
might begin at Ocala, Fla. (because
of its historical significance), and
wind up with a mass convention in
Georgia.
There could be a short interval of
time (not more than 30 days) be
tween the ending of your itinerancy
and the date for a national con
ference.
Whatever action such conference
might take, the Populist (democratic)
principle of Greenbacks vs. National
Bank Notes must be insisted upon as
fundamental. Make this question a
vital one and wage an aggressive
campaign on the financial platform of
the party, supplementing it by the
initiative and referendum according
to which all other questions must be
settled —that the people themselves
may rule. Advocate government
ownership and other reforms, if you
will, but pledge support to the princi
ple of direct legislation, promising
that all reforms advocated by any
party or faction or the people gener
ally shall be inaugurated only when
the votes of the people decide what
our reform laws shall be. If we con
centrate our efforts on this funda
mental two-plank platform, our posi
tion will prove invulnerable.
The name of the people’s party in
future may continue to be “Populist,”
or “Jeffersonian” could be substitut
ed. But it might *be best to employ
a name that represents the ideas of
government the people entertain. A
Liberty Party is what we need —call
it what, you will. I would suggest
that all reformers unite under the
name of “The Commonwealth Party”
on the two-plank platform suggested
above. On such a platform even
Bryan could have been, yes, would
have been, President long ago.
I observe that one of your corre
spondents suggests that you devote
ypur time and efforts henceforth to
writing books. I have for a long time
thought that you could render the edu
cational public (teachers and schools)
no better service than to write a text
book on United States history—suited
especially for use by teachers. Reach
them first—through them their pupils.
Such a history as you would write,
would certainly be unexpurgated—the
truth would be told. Our school
teachers themselves do not know
enough about the financial history of
the country. You would make every
step of that plain. Then, indirect tax
ation and States rights you would en
lighten many Northern historians on.
Your two Jeffersonians are continu
ally revealing some important fact in
the history of the country that
most people are kept in ignorance of
by plutocratic authors who sometimes
seem to be writing to hide the truth.
Your friends everywhere ought to use
their influence to have your magazine
furnish material for literary societies.
I wish I were able to give a sub
scription for the Jeffersonian maga
zine to every literary society in our
colleges and public schools that would
agree to have one of your editorials
read as a part of their programs at
each meeting.
Your position on foreign missions
seems extreme but, sifted to the last
analysis, I believe you are right. Keep
this phase of the question before the
church till it recognizes the merit of
your contention. Too many Christians
forget that America herself needs sav
ing just now. Sincerely,
Jas. L. Kibler.

“A PERPETUAL SUBSCRIBER.”
118 Linn St., Ithaca, N. Y.,
March 3, 1909.
Mr. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: Enclosed find SI.OO check,
for which please renew my subscrip
tion to your Jeffersonian Magazine
for a year. During the time you have
issued your present magazine, I have
missed but one or two copies. I con
sider that in some of them I have
been enabled to read some of the best
literary gems that have come to my
notice. I am especially fond of your
biographical sketches. Have never
seen a poor one among them.
Although I do not agree fully with
you politically, I thoroughly believe in
the major part of your picture of the
situation, only a difference of opinion
as to methods. Have worked as a buy
er on the Albany and New York public
markets for a number of years, and
know the truth of your portrayal of
the poor classes of the cities. Hoping
that your magazine may have the best
of success, I am,
A perpetual subscriber,
Joseph J. Wallace.
EX-CONFEDERATE STILL FIGHT
ING FOR STATES’ RIGHTS.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Enclosed find one dollar, for which
please run up my figures for the week
ly Jeffersonian.
lam an ex-Confederate veteran. In
my old age it is a source of great
pleasure to read your works. When
ever I want to get solid, plain, reliable
facts on any question I go to Tom
Watson.
©be
I have not always agreed with him;
neither have I always voted for him.
I have made several resolutions with
the beginning of the new year, one of
which is to lay aside one dollar of the
pension money that I get from the
State every year to help Watson keep
alive the fires of State Rights that we
fought for in the sixties.
I note with approving pleasure your
position on the California issue with
the Japs and admire your boldness in
telling Pres. Roosevelt that he has no
constitutional right to prevent Cali
fornia, or any other State, from clos
ing her white schools to the Japs, the
Chinese or the negroes.
I suggest that every Confederate
veteran from this good year on will
give at least one dollar annually to
Watson to aid him in defending the
right of a State to regulate her own
domestic affairs, prescribe the quali
fications of voters, and adopt what
ever policies and regulations not in
consistent with the powers granted the
Federal Government. This inherent
sovereign right of the States is what
we fought for. May we never be
driven from this God-given right by
the Big Stick of a Hamiltonian-Cen
tralist. Neither should we be deceived
by the winning smiles of the Big Pos
sum-eater, and forget that the 11 States
made the Federal Government.”
(Sometimes I feel like I want to fight
it over.)
Mr. Watson, if you make any com
ments on what I have written, please
tell us again what are our Constitu
tional rights as States to govern the
liquor traffic. Do you think this con
gress will give us any protection!
An old Veteran,

REFORM PARTIES MUST GET
TOGETHER.
Brittany, La., Feb. 26, 1909.
To the Jeffersonian:
The many interesting “Letters from
the people” impel me to write a few
words to the Jeffersonian. In the
first place, I want to sincerely thank
Mr. Watson for his liberal counsel_ in
the past. I know lam not exaggerat
ing when I venture the assertion that
this generation will search in vain for
a man that will measure to the stan
dard of Watson, the undaunted leader
of Jeffersonian Democracy. Not only
in mental capacity is he amiable, but
especially so for those characteristics
that prompt the devotion of his
precious time even to personal inter
views.
In Mr. Watson we the common peo
ple have a friend and leader.
I have read the letters of Dr. J. W.
Clark of Indiana and many other in
dorsers of the Indianian’s views in
regard to the calling of State and
county conferences throughout the
South and West for the purpose of
organizing a People’s Party and
uniting the reformers of tail parties
upon one platform, viz.: Direct Legis
lation. From time to time we read
suggestions of calling a convention of
the leaders of the reform parties, out
line some definite platform, change in
party name, consolidate the reform
forces iand wage war upon the Ham
iltonians. This idea would seem to
be a rational one. With the South
divided into numerous reform parties,
one fighting another, each trying te
gain the upper hand, there is little
prospect of reform. With the South
united under one banner, working to
the same end, time alone can tell the
results.
By this time there are undoubtedly
many clients who would be delighted
to have Mr. Watson give us his opin
ion of the move. The writer can tee
no good reason why reform leaden
could not reason together and outline
a harmonious platform that could re
that will better conditions,
Sincerely yours in any movement
deem the masses.

GEORGIA STATE CHAIRMAN’S
SUGGESTIONS FOR RE
ORGANIZATION.
Clem, Ga., Feb. 22, 1909.
Dear Mr. Watson:
Enclosed find $2.00, for which move
up my dates for the two “Jeff’s” 12
months.. I am glad to see so many
true Jeffersonians expressing a desire
to see the reform forces organized.
My opinion is we have generally
waited till too near election time to
push organization work. As it is im
possible to succeed without the aid
of the press, the editors of all reform
publications should be organized into
a reform press association, and work
in harmony with whatever plan of
organization is agreed upon.
A good plan would be to call a gen- •
eral conference, state* 5 the principles
we stand for in as few words as pos
sible, with an unswerving determina
tion to battle for them, and head en
rollment blanks similar to what we
used in the recent campaign, then
send out organizers in every congres
sional district to enroll all who believe
in these principles, and to solicit sub
scriptions for our publications had to
the campaign fund; then, when the
reformers generally see that organiza
tion work is going on, it will not be
hard to get our county, State, congres
sional district and precinct commit
tees in working order all over the
country.
The people want to see results.
They want to see something practi
cal, some hope of success.
We need a general understanding
all around, Your friend,
J. J. Hollaway.
FOR THE JEFFERSONIANS.
No. Franklin, Conn., Feb. 10, 1909.
Editor of the Jeffersonians:
I see by your paper that a large
number of men are getting anxious
for an organization, but have not seen
any plan telling “how to do it.” For
some time I have been formulating a
simple, plain, cohesive, systematic,
and practically inexpensive plan
whereby I believe that an organiaa
tion can be formed in every State ia'
the Union, in an incredibly short space
of time, Provided: Men are as anxious
as they profess. To test the sincerity
and earnestness of some of the read
ers of this article, to any one who will
write me inclosing a 2-cent stamp for
a reply, I will send this plan for in
spection and approval or disapproval.
