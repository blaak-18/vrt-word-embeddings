The Foreign Mission Con
troversy
That close corporation of mission
mad enthusiasts and intolerable
bigots, who are endeavoring to de
fend the present method of conduct
ing foreign missionary work among
the heathen, are doing the cause a
great deal of harm by inviting such
men as William T. Ellis to abuse,
misrepresent and villify Hon. T. E.
Watson. No sane man can censure
Mr. Watson for refusing to debate
with Ellis. Ellis before the begin
ning of this controversy was practi
cally unknown. Watson’s fame is
national and world-wide among peo
ple of scholarly attainments and
real culture. Ellis eagerly seized the
opportunity to attain more notoriety
than he ever had before. The mis
take was made in these missionary
cranks selecting such a man to de
fend their cause against such an able
opponent as Mr. Watson. There are
worlds of good argument for For
eign Missions and some of the
world’s best and brightest men are
thoroughly in sympathy with the
movement either for the sake of
popular approval or from genuine
sincerity. Notably among them is
William J. Bryan and Teddy Roose
velt. No sane thinking man who
has heard both Bryan and Watson
speak or lecture could truthfully
say that Mr. Watson is below the
standard of W. J. Bryan in open de
bate. Mr. Bryan himself would not.
Then why should the preachers
and laymen of Georgia invite Ellis
to meet Mr. Watson? It was a mis
take. Those who heard Ellis in Ma
con and Athens no longer wondered
why Watson refused to meet him.
He was a decided disappointment.
As it was expressed by a very intel
ligent hearer of Ellis at Athens,
“Any school boy of ordinary ability
would be more than a match for
Ellis.” But the last tirade of Ellis
delivered at Broughton’s Tabernacle
in Atlanta, invited there especially
to answer certain charges of Mr.
Watson, puts him beyond the pale of
decent consideration. If the news
papers quote him correctly he does
not advance a single argument. He
does not produce one syllable, line,
or word of facts or figures to prove
anything. He merely makes bare
assertions. To begin, he is utterly
unfair.
He states that he came South to
refute charges of Mr. Watson. Mr.
Watson never at any time or place
made the charges that Ellis claims
he did. Mr. Watson quoted some
one else as having said that
“there are as many American women
led astray by the Chinese as there
are Chinese converts.” This man
Ellis proceeds to credit this quota
tion to Mr. Watson, and says he
comes South to refute the monstrous
charge. He proceeds to say “that
since nobody in Georgia seems in
clined to take it up, I feel that I
owe it to the Georgia women that I
met in the Orient to come down here
and nail that slander.” We of the
South would let Ellis know that we
do not need the aid of any blue
bellied Yankee ignoramus to defend
the purity of Southern womanhood.
Mr. Watson himself is the embodi
ment of Southern chivalry. He
would defend with life that purity
that has ever characterized the
womanhood of the South. The wom
en of the South themselves know
this and would today rather have
one Watson to refute charges
against them like that made by Col
lier’s Weekly some time ago, than a
thousand Ellises.
But aside from the utter lack of
arguments or logic in this speech of
Ellis his bald statement that Mr.<
Watson “is neither a gentleman nor
a scholar” puts him in the braying
jackass class. Had he contented
himself with saying that Mr. Watson
was not a gentleman, many would
have agreed with him, though it was
a brazen lie, for there are many who
Obe j effer son tan
ignorantly think the same Yhing, but
the bitterest enemy of your Uncle
Thomas has to concede that as a
scholar he has most all of them
pushed off the map. If you don’t
believe that he is some scholar, just
ask some of the college professors
where they go to get literary and
historical information, when some
bright student puts questions to
them that they cannot answer. The
truth of the matter is that Thomas
E. Watson knows more of law, more
of political economics, more of lit
erature, more of history, and more
of everything else that goes to make
the genuine scholar, in one minute,
than Ellis would be capable of learn
ing were he to live a thousand years
and be compelled to spend that
time improving his seldom brain.
Now, we are not capable, proba
bly of advising the Georgia Layman,
an organization ruled and controlled
by the clergy, but if we were we
would tell them to let little Ellis
stay at home and employ some one
else to produce proof and argument
who can deliver the goods. It would
also be beneficial to them to read
the defense of present day methods
of conducting foreign missionary
work, in Watson’s March Magazine,
written by a gentleman, we do not
recall his name, now living in the
Philippine Islands. It is without
doubt the ablest article in defense
of their position that has yet ap
peared, or perhaps that will appear.
Mr. Watson himself has not in any
satisfactory matter met and refuted
the logic and argument contained in
that article. It is written in the true
Christian spirit and founded upon
the bedrock of absolute fairness,
while all other arguments we have
seen up to date have contained too
much of misrepresentation and con
cealment of the real facts. —Royston

PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Son of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging up and
exposing corruption and graft in
“Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best informed man on
missions in America.” The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
full of facts, evidence and argu
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in the thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
