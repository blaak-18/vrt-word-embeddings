What Our Farmers Are Saying
and Doing
may be dirty. Trouble may come
from disease in the families of work
men engaged about the premises.
Epidemics of scarlet fever have been
traced to this source.
A quart of milk is said to be equal
in nutrition to a pound of beefsteak.
It is also said to be equal to two
pounds of bread. A pound of steak
costs anywhere from ten to thirty
cents, according to the cut and the
market. Two pounds of bread cost
usually from ten to twelve cents.
Why should milk sell for less than
bread or beefsteak?
Milk and cream take up odors and
taints from unclean vessels in which
they may be placed, or from any sub
stance emitting an odor. They are
easily spoiled and made unwhole
some for food if any dirt or filth gets
into them, or if they are covered up
light so that the fresh air does not
get to them to remove the odors and
gases which may be forming in them.
Good butter contains from twelve
to fifteen per cent of water. Some
butter makers try to increase the
■weight by increasing the moisture
content. This method is not honest
and it is not good policy. Such work is
characterized as fraudulent. At
tempts are being made to regulate it
by law, in fact, some authorities claim
that the pure food law as it now
stands covers it. —From “Dairy
Notes,’’ in the Agricultural Epitom
ist.

A COTTON PICKING MACHINE IN
VENTED.
Mr. T. D. Murphy, in the Augusta
Chronicle of last Saturday, has this
to say of the invention of the cotton
picker which will be read with inter
est by the farmers of Washington,
which is one cf the largest cotton pro
ducing counties in the State:
“Business men, capitalists, machin
ists and others who have acquaint
ed themselves with the cotton picker
invented by Mr. Harry E. Foucher,
confidently believe that Mr. Foucher
Las ‘hit it’ sure.
“Gentlemen who have examined
the invention and who have seen it
work, in a preliminary way, declare
that it is a success without qualifica
tion.
“Mr. Foucher has been very care
ful about his patents, and has well
protected himself in this regard. He
has friends upon friends in Augusta,
who will be gratified at his success.
It has been said for years that sooner
or later electricity would revolution
ize cotton picking, ginning and bal
ing. If Mr. Foucher has ‘gotten it’
on the cotton picking his great repu
tation and fortune are made.’’ —San-
dersville Progress.
FARMING WITH NEGRO LABOR.
The following thoughtful editorial
is taken from the Texas Farm and
Ranch: Would it be too wild a sug-
Gbe Tkffersoftlan
gestion to predict that the time may
be almost upon us when farming must
be done almost exclusively by the
white man? Should such be the case,
we have a startling complication to
the negro and the labor problem in
the South. A series of articles now
running in this publication deal with
the negro as a free farmer, and show
that the negro has failed. These ar
ticles portray the inferior race as in
capable at present of grappling with
even the simpler problems of self
support. It may then be asked: If
the negro has difficulty in changing
from the double shovel pulled by one
mule to the walking double culti
vator drawn by a team, how can we
expect him to cope with the prob
lems of an age when intensified agri
culture must obtain to meet the de
mands of a civilization growing ever
more complex?
It cannot be denied that the call of
the new agriculture puts a strain
upon a large portion of our whites
and that many of them must drop
from the occupation and join the
ranks of wage-workers in cities.
What then of the ignorant negro
ivnose mental plane is far below that
of the “po’ white trash” of other
days, who has almost exhausted the
fertility of his soils and who cannot
successfully raise even staple crops?
Negroes, aware of their inability
to exist on the plantations, have been
leaving in numbers during the last
decade or two. Negro farm labor is
hard to obtain, and unsatisfactory
when obtained. The advance of the
South depends, in a large measure,
upon improving our agriculture.
Farm labor in the South proper, is
done mostly by negroes. Today this
kind of farming is cumbersome and
ancient. Comes the question: Can
the negro be taught? Comes the re
tort: Have we time to wait?
Progress must be delayed if we
teach the negro to farm. What be
comes of the negro if we dispense
with him?
The question is a complicated one
and the development of the next few
years may make it even more so. -
PARCELS POST.
We are in favor of the parcels post
system. The farmers should all be
in favor of it, says the Equity Farm
Journal.
There are two classes of persons
who oppose it. The merchant. They
do not strongly oppose it, but do so
feebly, from doubt as to whether it
will not affect them unfavorably.
There are some reasons why it will
affect them unfavorably, and some
reasons why it will be a benefit. It
is doubtful if it affects them sufficient
to warrant a two-cent stamp outlay
to register a kick. Second, the ex
press companies oppose it tooth and
toe-nail. They are making millions
and millions every year from their
express monopolies and they will
spend millions in newspaper opposi
tion, alleging injustice to others, but
never a word as to the benefits to
themselves if they can succeed in
killing the measure. We should de
mand the parcels post and not stop
till we get it.
