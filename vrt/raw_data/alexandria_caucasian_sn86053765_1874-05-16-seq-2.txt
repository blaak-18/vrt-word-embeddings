The Agricultural Fair.
At tho meeting of fho Board of
Directors of tho Agricultural Fair
Association®)!' this Parish on Sat
urday last, a liberal list of premi
ums for tho Fair this Fall was
adopted, which will be made public
in a short time. They will especi
ally encourage the cultivation of
'©
corn and the grasses and the rais
ing of sheep a®d hogs. Wool can
be made a source of profitable in
dustry in this Parish and tho rais»
inggOf hogs for meat will make us
independent of Commission Mer
chants, and enable planters to Bold
their cotton crops until they bring
remunerative prices. . « © °
8 - In conversation witlrour planters
they all acknowledge® tue truth of
this assertion, but allege, what is a
fact, that if is impossible to raise
sheep, hogs or cattle, because of
everything ofe the kind being stolen.
Our advice to them i.% to watch
their stock closely, to organize in
neighborhoods, and when fliev
catch any one, white, black or yel
low stcanng, to shoot or hang them
right there. . Don't bring them®to
'Court, with negro Juries -it is im
; possibly jo secure the punishment
'd' thcives, because, tjie negro does
! »et believe that it is. any harm to
steal from a white man. We have
no d?>ubt that^heiV are white men
engaged in ine stealing*business as
© ®
well as negroes. It should nfake
no ditl'erence whether the tfiief is
white, or black, k»,11 every one «-aught
in^ho act—let theni*see that i^ is
not a matter of merely being carri
<^d to court, to be turned loose or
sent for six months or a year to the
Penitentiary, but that to steal is to
'meet certain death. This course
broke up cattle and horse stealing
; in Texas* and rigidly pursued here
will soon make it practicable,?to con
suit our best interests by raising
such liye stock as natifre has indi
cated should be raised in our parish.

Never mind about the cotton, make
cotton the ; secondnry crop and corn

neglect one, let cotton go to theQflevil
where it is carrying our parish, an?l
stick ta the corn through thick and

of raising cotton shows that by the
time it is si 3d if; costs tho planter not
less than J'nrt)/ fire dollars a baß;
und this is a very moderate estimate.
Say then that he gets Sixty dollars
for it,«,and he luis but a margin of
fifteen dollars, as tho profit from
ono and-a-half to two acre^ of his

main idle and the grass cut only
from the turning ®rows, tho same
quantity of land would yield liim
more money ; and ®if it, was planted

the profit on the cotton. Tho same
land cultivated in corn and fed to
hogs and cattle would yield doable
the money. Tho culture of Cotton'

The Now Orleans Picayune.
In its issue of Saturday last the
Picayune did us the honor to give
our paper its Editorial notice as
follows: o
Trtis O auoastan .—Wo have re
ceived several copies of a new pa
per just started at Alexandria, in
this State, under the above title.
The r allies of tho editors and pro
prieters are Messrs. G. W. Stafford.,
U. P. Hunter and AV. -F. Blackmail.
These gentleman haVeall been prom
inent politicians and aie vigorous
«riters and speakers, They have
stated with great clearness their
position, w*hich is ono of unswerv
ing advocacy "of the white irian's
government, Of independence of and
separation from all pre existing par
ties—and of a determination to as
sert, the rights of tho white men to
resume the administration of the
affairs of the State ; and whilst pro
tecting the #olored people in all
tlu'ir îiglôts, to keep them in a po
litical infeiior position. The Cau
casian indicates that in the coming
election in that city it will give its
support to no other party but that
which adopts the*progRimmo indi
cated.
A\'e are vory much obliged to
the Pic for its rather tardy notice,
but ®.o object to being callcd
" prominent politicians," when in
fact the eldest of the Editors of
tho Caucasian is not far in his
I
thirties, and no fono of them lias
ever had anything to do with poli
tics r.ntil since the war. AVe enter

injuistice done us when it says that :
» o'l'he Caucasian indicates that
fn the coming election ju that
fity it will give ifs support to no
other party»but that which adopts
the programme indicated."
We have to-day in our leader for

The KiduappiDgofMr, A. Qeyuian.
From this gentleman bimself wa
learn the trne history of his recent
thriiling adventure from the time
when, with the sanction of the
Usurper, who pretends to be Gov
ernor of Louisiana, he was brutal
ly assaulted by the JTew York and
New Orleans detectives on the
street; to the time of his safe arriv
al among his friends.
Tho story of his sufferings is one
of such inhuman brutality* such
fiendish malignity and outrageons
disregard of the dictates of common
civility, as to seem almost incrcdb
ble iii this age of boasted civilisa'
tion. That it is possible in this the
broad light Qf the nineteenth een*
tury that a citizen of ohe State, at
the behest of a bloated aristocrat of
another State, upon a trumped up
diarge, can be brytally beaten with
clubs, hurried into a cab, manacled
aud shackled, rushed into a car;
which by bribery was ready prepar*
ed, refused the right eveu to send
word to his family or friends, re
fused evpn a dr ink of water or water
to wash the blood from off his face
or chHhes, locked up in d separate
car, cuffed, threatened and abused
like a dog and speeded away from
home and friends, seems to be it
story so monstrous in its details, as
to challenge our incredulity. Yet
all these things are solemn iacts.
Nor was his troubles over here— re
fusing to obey the very law to whose
violated sanctity, Mr. Heyman was
to be .offered as a bloody sacrifice,
.his captors, in the double capacity
of natural brutes and blackguards
and supple tools to gratify the vin
dictive hate of New York aristo
crats, refused at several stations on
the route to deliver up their priso
ner in answer to writs of habeas cor
pus, and it was only after the offi
cers of the law had broken into the
car at Ifoîly Springs and taken
him by force that ho could get H
hearing at all. Ho was carried be
fore the Court and promptly dis
charged, when he was held and
compelled to answer successively to
nine* diflerent warrants, and only
got away by leaving during tho in
terval between the trial of the ninth
and the preparation of the tenth, he
having been discharged on them
all.
When tho liberty ot an Ameri
can citizen is subjected to such fla
grant violation at tho instance of
some malignant autocrat thousands
of miles away, it is time for us to
consider well some speedy and vio-°
lent remedy for such a eondtion ot
affairs. It was tho case of Mr.
Heyman yesterday, it may be tho
case of any of us to morrow. With
Mr. Hey man's business affairs and
financial connection with creditors
in Now York or elsewhere, we have
not hing to do. Be they as they may,
good, bad or indifferent, for them
t he Caucasian has no concern. We
are not speaking of him as a iner
clianto but as a citizen of Rapides
who has been most foully dealt with.
Admit the right tokiduap aud bru
tally treat him, and there is no tel
ling when an extension of tho
principle may end. We wonld soon
bo back to the time when-the tink
ling of Seward's. "little bell" could
scud any man in the North to a
dungeon; when popular prejudice
could banish such a patriot as Val
landinghani. IIo is now safe as we
have seen the publication of an or
der from Kellogg, the Usurper, pro
hibiting the issuance of any more
sucjji warrants upon requisitions
of Governors of other States.
Messrs. Clatlin & Co., will make a
better name for themselves*by col
lecting their debts via ordinaria—
than by ^sorting to such extra
ordinary ineaus of showing their
malignity, and tho Governor of
JSew York will doubtless find him
self sufficiently well employed it he
will attend to the numerous crimi
nals at home, and uot lend himself
to tho assistance of tho petty hate
of such men as Clatlin & Co., for
whom e our best wishes aro that they
may meet such financial disaster as
will leave them beggars upon that
charity abord, which they seem to
know so little, and dependent upon
that generosity of which they are
so utterly ignorant.

J. E. B kkda .—This gentleman,
with his bride, is here attending as
District Attorney, tho JVIuy term of
our District Court. Mr. Breda is a
native of our neighboring parish o|
Natchitoches, on which account, wo
had something to s ablast Saturday,
about tho legality of his acting of-*
ficially, owing to a recent change iw
this Judicial District. However, that
may be, he is a vigorous and forcible»
prosecutor and has succeeded well
during this, as well as during the
December term of Court in convict
ing criminals ; and under his ad
ministration there is a marked de
crease in crime in our parish. Ho
convicted five upon charges of larceny
on Wednesday last. In comparison
with his predessor the change is an
admirable one. There is plenty of
work for him to do here yet, if he
can get the Grand Juri«! to do their
dutv.
