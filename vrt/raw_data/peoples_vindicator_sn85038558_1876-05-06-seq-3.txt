Eighteen lhundred and seventy-six is
the &entennial year. It is also tihe year
in which an Opposition House of Repre
sentatives, the first since the war, will
be in power at Washington; andt the
year of the twenty-third election of a
President of the United States. All of
these events aro sure to 1be of great in
terest and importance, especially the two
latter; and all of them and everything
connected with them will be fully aind
freshly reported and expounded in The
SUN.
The Opposition House of Representa
tives, taking up the line of inquiry open
ed years ago y Tin, SU, will sternly
and dlligdltly investigate the corrup
tions anmd imnleeds of Grant's adminis
tration; and wilt, it is to be hoped, lay
the foundation for a new and better pe
riod in our national history. Of all this
Tli SUN will cont:ai complete and ac
curate acocountls, furnishing its readers
with early and trustworthy information
Iupion the"e absorbing topiey.
The twenty third Presidential election,
with the preparations for it, Wtll be me
niorable as deciding upon Gint's aspi
rations for a third term of power and
plunder, and still more as dciding who
shall be the candidate of the partj of
Reform, and asslecting that eandidate.
Concerning all thelue subjects, those who
