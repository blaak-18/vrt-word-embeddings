the State of Louisiana, find to the
imminunt danger of republican insti
tution* throughout the cutirc couti
tr)'.
• And whereas, with a view to con
trolling and determining the results
of the approaching election, to be
held in Louisiana in November next,
he has, under un act known ns the
"registration act," and passed fur the
purpose of defeating the popular will,
secured to himself and his parti nan»
the power of denying registration to
bona fide citizens, whose applications
before the courts for a mandamus to
compel the assistant supervisors to
enroll and register them has been re
futed, the registration law punish
the courts if they dare to take cogni
zaaee of such appeals.
And whereas, by false and infa
mous representations of the motiv
of our people, lie has received the
promise of aid faom the Federal iir
my, placed at the orders of the At
torney General of the II hi ted Status,
and subject to the ciylls of United
States supervisors, for the purpose of
overaweing our State and controlling
the election.
And whereas, in the language, of
the call for this meeting, "one by one
our dearest rights hâve beer, tram
pled upon," until at lost, in the su
• prent« height of Its insolence, this
mockery of a republican government
lias even dared to deny that right ho
Aolemnly guaranteed by the coustitu
tion of the United States, which de
clares "that the right of the people
to bear arms shall never be in tin
ged."
Ile it resolved, That wo reaffirm
solemnly the resolutions adopted by
tho white people of Louisiana, in
convention assembled ut Baton Bouge
on August 24, 1874:
That the white peupla of Louisiana
liar« no right to deprive the colored
people of their rights.
That W. 1'. Kellogg is a mere usur
per, and wo kciioum-o liiin as such.
That his government is arbitrary,
unjust and oppresive, nnd can only
maintain itself through Federn I Inter
farenoe: that the election nnd regis
tration laws under which this flection
is being conducted, were intended to
perpetuate the usurpation by depriv
ing tlio people, nnd especially nil
itaturalir.ed citizens, of mi opportunity
to regmtei and vote.
Therefore, in the name of the citi
rens of New Orleans, in mass meeting
assembled, and of the pcopln of the
Stat« of Loiiittiniw, whom franchise
lias been wrested from I hem by fraud
and violence, nnd nil of w I iumm rights
nml liberties have been outraged and
tranipled 0 upon.
We demand of Win. Pitt Kellogg his
Immediate Abdient ion.
Itcsolved, That a committee of five
lie immediately appointed by the Chair
man to wait on W. I'. Kellogg, to pre
sent to him nu immediate answer, and
to report the result of such interview
to thu meeting.
Mr. Msrr then continued to speak.
The committve would wait on Kellogg,
wnuld go without arms, open or con
cealed, and would immediately repmt
to the meeting Gov. Kellogg'* ans'ver
to tho demand of the people. Mi.
Marr asked the meeting not, to adjourn
until the committee reported KelloggV
answer
The following gentlemen wero then
tinmed as the committee : H. II. Marr,
«Iules Tuyes, J. M. Ses is, J. IS. Woods,
and Samuel CHoppin.
At about 1 o'clock, tho commit tee
0 sent to Kellogg returned in carringes
a le id a series of cheers that never
were heard in all history, until the
very air rang with shouts.
Mr. Marr appeared at once on the
gallery nud made the report of the
committee. The comuiittu hud'called
at Kellogg'« office, but fouud him not
there.
Heury C. Dibble, who reported him
•elf as being on Kellogg'» stall', received
them, nnd they laid the demand of the
people before liiui. D.bble demanded
* few moments consideration, retired
and then then returned with a commu
nication nominally from Kellogg, but
with no signature thereto.
This communication recited that
Kellogg had learned that large bodies
of armed white men were congregated
in varions portion of tho city, at the
same call as tho mass meeting, and
who were aummoned to enforce the
demand of tho people; that he could
only regard this as a menance to
which lie could not yield; lint, if the
, people would meet peaceably in max*
Meeting, ho (Kellogg) was perfectly
willing to listen to their petitions.
tur COIOUTTKE'« REPORT.
The committee replied to Dibble that
it was talse, that there were no armed
men on Canal street, nnd that no men
had been called to enforce the demand
of the people, and that if Kellogg re
signed he would not be at all hurt.
Mr. Marr then left it to the people to
decide what they should do, whether
they should endure this any longer, ur
rise snd drive out the usurper.
Cries of "Hang Kellogg," "We'll
fight," "Call out the troops,"
Dr. Beard then cam« forward, nnd
With glowiog words called on the peo
ple to defend their rights, to coine ar
med to boh) the city againrt Kellogg
sad all his hirelings, to make the whole
eitjr aa armed camp, and never leave it
until the laft of Kellogg's gang left tlie
eity. Their wives, their brothers,
would briug them food aud cheer them
in their fight.
The crowd received this with anoth
er roand of cheers, and c&lled for im
mediate actioo and for lenders.
Mr. Marr then addressed the people,
telling them to go horn© nnd get their
jRRns nad report nt Canal street nt half

wade«« and an orgniilted body there,
who would propeily draft and arrange
aU military nistfvw nnd (tauUh guu. ;
and then the action to bo taken by the
people could bo determined oil.
In the greatest earnestness, enthusi

is the text of tho committee's leport,
inducing KeMogg's response to the do
maud and tho official statement of what
ensued:
New ()ileans Sept. I I, IH7-I.
Gentlemen : 1 havo communicated
with tho Governor, and ho directs me
to say to you that ho must decline to
receive any commun lent ion from the
committee appointed by the mass meet,
ing assembled ou Canal street; he does
no, I mi Instructed to s»y, because he
has definite and accurate information
that there are now assembled several
large bodies of armed men in different
parts of the city who are met at the
call which enlivened the iiiiimh meeting
wii ich you represent. Mo regards this
as n menace, and ho will roceivo no
communication under such circbmstau
ces.
Ho, furthermore, directs mo to say
that should the people asscmbled ponce
fully nud without menace, ho would
deem it one of his highest duties to re
ceive any communication from them,
and to entertain nny petition address
ed to the Government.
I have received you, gentlemen, and
I convey tho Governor's answer as a
member of his stall'. II. C. iMiini.ic,
In answer to the organ of the Gover
nor, II. Dibble, I stated :
'Mint wo represented no armed body,
but a mass meeting of unarmed citf
kciih , assembled oti Canal street; that
there wero no armed incii on Caual

that we eaino on a mission of peace,
nud that if tho Governor should have
acccded to our proposition, we believe
it would have produced perfect peace
throughout the St;ite, and that wo were
prepared to pledge ourselves that no
harm should be done to him, either in
person or properly, but on the contrary
that there should be perfect immunity
to hot!).

To which Mr. Dibble replied that

Til IC SITUATION.
It. may lie interesting to recall the
situation ns it, was yesterday morn
ing. Things have changed su much
since then, and se . 'in likely to change
so much more, that, these mutters
become valuable lis history.
At tho Custom-House were some
I.JO soldiers, companies l>. and K.
Mît Ii Infantry, from liaton Kotige.
These were stationed in the dun
geons, the warehouses on the base
incut (loor of the old granite build
ing, a very oM, dirty ami damp
camping ground. The Unit«
marshals were busy among them,!
distributing tin; soldiers around inj
such a style as to make Ibeui appeal
as nufnerous as possible.
The soldiers appeared worn, tired!
and fatigued, but, in good humor;!
and necmed neither to expect nor!
desire lighting verv much.
A largo gang several hundreds -
of idle negroes congregated here, ev
supposing that the labaryu
lliian mazes of the Custom House!
would a(!'<>rd llictu a safe
ease of a "scrimmage.''
At the Stale House there was the
of negroes, but rath
er of the political than laboring class.
Every noor was shut and bolted,
even to the little soda-water stand at
the corner of St. Louis and Iloynl.
The ladies' entrance, now the en
trance to the Governor's office, was
closed, admittance being refused to
all except dear political friends.
For these the door was half opened
and the guests; compelled to squeeze
in among a gang of metropolitans.

j
About thirty or forty metropolitans
paraded the gallcrp, in lieu of tho
usual political bummers, evidently to
givo the people the idea that, tho
building was j strongly garrisoned,
From St. Louis street, down, all the
stores ou lloyjal street wero closed
at a very early;hour, and a continu
wit h
oiis crowd kep$ pouring into
Street. Soveril ; men, armed
guns, passed 'ici«)se by tlu: 'police
station, but the., metropolitans did
not appear desirous of noticing
these, and turned their eyes another
way to avoid t|icm.
The Third Ijjrécinct Station! was a
perfect citadeljl ïlcre was collected
the greatest iiujnber of metropoli
tans. In the «Supreme Court room
about two hundred metropolitans
were stationed, all fully provided
Canal
with ammunition, and carrying tlieii
bayonets fixed and ready for action.
These seemed to have orders to re
main there, as their only amuse-led;
ments were smoking and conversing
with the colored ladies back of town,
who congregated on the square op
posite.
Here also were some forty or morel
satis culottes, not. Metropolitans and
not wearing uniforms, but attjired in
rags and dirty shirts, and drafted es
pecially for the occasion frojhi the
streets or.the prisons, carrvinjj their
guns with a very martial air. The
two alleys, Orleaus aud Exchange,
wer® shut to all passers-by, being
juarcHl by dètachireats of police,
acting ns s?ntrie«j. In Orleans Alley
were some 30 Uh'lans, their horses,
as well as the artillery horseë. tied
to the Cathedral tVuf.
Down stairs, in the police st-'io i.
were some 50 more inetropoiitain.
also apparently prepared, nud uh<<
declined to enter info coll versai ion
with any one on any tutbjcul what
ever.
Lastly, the arsenal was guarded,
or occupied by some dozen men, pre
paring the cannon in case ofconllict.
PROCLAMATION.
For two years you have borno with
pxtieiice and fortitude a great, wrong.
Through fraud and violence the Gov
ernment of your choice has been over
thrown and it m power usurped. Protest
after protest, appeal after appeal to the
President of tho IJuite,d States and to
Congress have failed to give yon the
lelief you had a l ight under the con
stitution to demand.
Tho wrong has not been repaired.—
On the» contrary, through the lustra
mentality of partisan judges, you urn
debarred from all legal remedy. Day
bv day taxation has been increasing —
with costs and penalties amounting to
confiscation of your property; your
substance gqucudcrcd ; your credit
ruined, resulting in failure and bank
ruptcy of your most valued institut ions.
The right of suffrage is virtually taken
from ,\ou by the enactment otakillful
I y devised registiatioii and election
la ws.
The judicial branch of vour Govern
ment has been stricken down by the
'oiivcrsiun of the legal posse eomitatus
of (he sheriff to use of I ho usurper, for
tho put poseof defeating the decrees of
the courts; hit dcflanco of law leading
him to use this very force for the ar
rest of the sheriff himself, while en
gaged in the execution of the process
of I he court.
To these calamities may be added a
corrupt nud virions Legislature con
cocting laws, in violation of the consti
tution, for the (nu pose of guarding and
perpetuating their usurped authority —
a metropolitan police paid l:y the city,
under the control of tho iisui per, quar
tered upon you to overawe and keep
you in subjugation.
livery publie right has been denied
you; and, as if to goad you to despera
tion, private arin» are siczed and indi
viduals arrested« To such extremities
are you driven that manhood revolts
at f m t her submission.
Constrained from a sense of duty, as
the legally elcct.cd Lieutenant Govn n
or of tho State, (acting Governor in the
absence of Gov. Alel'.ncry,) I do here
by issu« this my proclamation, calling
jupon the militia of the State, einbrae

eighteen and forty-five years, without

THE FIGHT.
Suddenly a volley, or nit her a doz
en volleys, were fired oji them, some
from the buildings, some from the
street, and Companies A, II and K of
the Crescent City White League,
headed by General' Ogden and Capto,
Huck, Gallagher and W. H. I'leasant,
charged lipon the metropolitans in
the most gallant and noble manner,
They received the (Ire of tho metro
polit ans without flinching and kept
straight, on in their charge. Seeing
this, the metropolitans wavered,
scattered and rushed off toward the
Custom-House. A volley oftliccit
i/.ens brought down eighteen men at
the first fire, all of them seriously in
iuied, those slightly wounded mak
ing o/f. Among the fallen was
ha do i:r,
who was vainly endeavoring to rally
his men. Hadger was mortally woun
ded, being shot through the arm, leg
and side. It, is said that lie IIred on
his own men when he saw them run

that Corporal Me. Mantis fell.
When the citizens came up he sur

TIIB PURSUIT.
The pursuit of metropolitans was
kept up almost to the very doors of
llie Custom House. About forty
fell on the field, some of them being
only slightly injured. Eleven, how
ever, were killed, and four, among
fhern a mulatto, (the only negro
hurt) were mortally wounded, About
a dozen others were severly wounded.
The remained were only slightly
hurt. The metropolitans were per
fectly panic stricken. About forty
of thein ran up into the Custom
House, whore all the Radical chiefs
were, assembled, and refused to leave
t here. Some ran up Canal street and
were shot, nnd the remainder escaped
and dispersed in all directions.
Some, however, organized and es

In this fight, on tho levee, the citizens
suffered somewhat themselves. Four

ed, some of them dangerously. The
killed were IS. Toledauo, Dick Lindsey,
Major J. K. Gourdnln, Jules Gautier.
J .oiigstreet,'H division marched up with
a reinforcement during the fight, but
apparently changed bis mind, and with
the accessions from such of the metro
politans as escaped Badger's fate, ro
ll oaled to Jackson Wtpiare, leaving be
hind to the citizens one Gatlln, two
I J pound Napoleon guns and one howit

all along the line, encouraged the cili
zens, ami about (I o'clock they marched
down and appeared on Canal street, but
tlien* wero no peelers there; they had
retreated and were eseoused ju dm ;n-_

frightened, and kept together solely by
Lougstreef., who plead with them to
stay and tight.
Their soie cannon appeared to be a
l'J-|>oun l Napoleon, pointing down St.
Anno street, -over which Longstreet
personally presided.
There appeared to be little If any de
-ire on I he part of the metropolitans to

(hardly knew what to do. Their only
hupe, they confessed, was tho United
States troops, and they peered forward,
ever, like sister Annie, looking for
them.

At Tclioupitoulas street several inen

.Magazine street, a car driver, whilst
driving his car was fired into by the
metropolitans and killed, his brains be
ing scattered all over the car.
Down town there was no regular
lighting, hut skirmishing was kept up
ail the day long. A body of citizens ou
the corner of Koyal and Conti were fired
ou half a dozen times by the metropoli
tans, who advanced by them. One man
whilst crossing Koyol street, was killed
by the police; one policeman was also
slain there.

At about half past ti a body of peeler*,
from thirty to forty iu number, march

pared to charge on them, when the
peelers called l'or a conference, and
said they had had enough fighting and
wanted logo home. They surrendered
willingly their guns and pistols, which
were distributed among the citizens.—
took ofl their hats and
coats to avoid recognition and dispersed
for home. The citizens to whom the
peelers surrendered were an unattach
ed troupe from the Sixth Ward, about
fifteen in number.
Farther down town were several par
ties of citizens, but they had very little
skirmishing to do, and no one, citizen
or metropolitan, was known to bo killed.
On canal utrect tlicro was generally
quiet, large bodies of unarmed citizens
congregated to look on, and there was
very little lighting. The police from
the Cnstom-House kept up a fire on
the citizens on tho street, killiug two
inoffensive lookers-on. Two metro
politans, who were flying from the
battle-field on the Levee, wore dashing
up Canal street when they were fired

HURRENbKKS.
Twenty five policemen, who wore
stationed in a building on Decatur
street, wero cut oIT at the rout of
Ihn Igor 's forces. They were visited
by half a dozen citizens and prompt
ly surrendered to them their arms
and retired from service. A force of
about a dozen men, at the Central
Police Station, likewise surrendered
when called on to do so. Tho station
was then taken possession of and
guarded by citizens.
At the store of Kurshcojt& Bienve

party was established. Communica

and it required quite a number of
clerks ami u large sraff on the business.
Ammunition nud food wero hero dis

About 10 o'clock nix or seven hun

standing that they wero to report to

men under arms during tliecntire night
within the limits of Julia, Kampart,

At the Custom Ilouse tlmro wore
about 150 troops at the Custom House

Acting Governor Penn appointed
yesterday, Mr Thomas Boylan Chief
of P olice for the city of New Orleans. '
Mr. Boylan is a gentleman weil
known for his intelligence, strict
attention to duty and unquestioned
integrity. He has been for years a
resident of New Orleans, and ift ad
mired not only by our merchants,
but by all persons who are acquaint
ed with him. His experience in the
Police Department of the city, irith
which he has been for years con
nected, will enable him to discharge
the duties of his office to the satis
faction of our people.
Gov. Penn is organizing a respect
able body of police officers ; and h«
will no doubt make good selections.
A large number of eolored persons

As might have been cxpeclcd, after
tho decisivo victories of ycstcrdiu, and
the consequent demoralisation of tho

inflated, insolent and overbearing, it
collapsed at ono touch of honest indig
dation and gallant onslaught. Its
boasted armament dissolved before the
furious rush of our citizens, its sneer
ing, thieving, unscrupulous rhieftnins
hid like moles, and its mercenaries fled
like stuuipeded cattle.
A dozen gallant lives, worth more
than all the sneaking carpet-baggers
and ruffian soldiery that ever squatted
on a State's carcass, have been sacri
ficed ou the altar of liberty ; tho blood
of gentlemen and patriots has dyed the
stones of our thoroughfares ; and the
shock is over. The Kellogg dynasty
has passed into a black and bitter
memory, aud Louisiana throughout its
borders to-day is free !
