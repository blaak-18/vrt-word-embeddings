Cost of Government.
The old party administrations
have been on a big jamboree during
the past thirty years. They
haven't sobered up yet, though the
hard times pinch their rations
somewhat, but they are in for it
and must keep up their lick to re
tain power. The cost of main
taining the government goes right
along, increasing year by year,
much faster than our population
increases. This is demonstrated
in Thomas H. Benton's "Thirty
Years' View." He says- that dur
ing Jefferson's administration the
yearly expenses of the government
were about $3,500,000. The popu
lation was about 6,000,000, making
the expense sixty cents per capita.
At the end of Monroe's adminis
tration in 1825, the cost had in
creased to $7,000,000. As the po
pulation at that date had increased
to 11,000,000, the annual expense
was seventy-five cents per capita.
In the last year of Van Bnren's
administration, says Mr. Beaten,
the expenses had reached $13,000,
000. This was in 1841. The popu
lation was 17,500,000. The cost of
the governmeut was, therefore,
about seventy-five cents per head.
But look at it today. The regu
lar annunal expense of carrying on
hda originally simple government
of ours has reached the enormous
sum of $400,000.000 or nearly
seven dollars for each man, woman
and child in the United States.
It is this culpable extravagance,
using no harsher term, that has
brought forth the People's l'arty,
and that will Increase its numbers
until every department of ;the iov
ernment is under its control. If it
does net or cannot clean the Au
geoan stable of its accumulated
filth and corruption, the people
may as well hang their harps upon
the willows and die; for a republi
can form of government will be
proved a fallure.-Populist Tri
bune.
The public'road laws of Louisi
ana fall far short of meeting our
requirements, and not until they
are changed will we have a system
of public thoroughfares that will
be adequate to the demands of the
people. Our roads are almost in
the rear of everything else in the
Stat4 and the road question merits
greater attention from the people
and their law makers than it has
yet reuiived.-Crowley Signal.

A certain girl we know of says
an exchange, found a package of
love letters written to her mother
by her father before they were
married. The daughter saw that
she could have a little sport, and
read them to her mother, pretend
ing that they were of a late date
and substituting her name for that
of her mother, and that of a fine
young man for that of her father.
The mother jumped up and down
in her chair, shifting her feet and
seemed terribly disgusted and for.
bade her daughter having any
thing to do with the yonng man
who would write such sickening
and nonsensical stuff to a girl.
When the yonng lady handed the
letters to her mother to read, the
house became so still thatÂ° one
could hear the grass growing in
the back yard.-Meridional.
In the congressional elections
this fall the populists may be ex
pected to cut a :decided figure.
The unsettled condition of business
and the wide spread disastors con
tribute to their strength. Their
radical doctrines promise a more
decisive change than their Demo
crat or Republican ascendancy
would secure and a change is al
ways attractive to the voter who
finds the existing states unprofit
able or oppressive. It must be
said in behalf of the Populists, too
that their representatives in con
gress have manifestly kept faith
with their party. Their vote has
been cast as a unit din favor of
every measure promising to lighten
or adjust the burden of taxation,
to remedy the injustice of a mono
polistic currency, to abridge privil
eges, or to protect rights. For
these reasons it is fair to anticipate
decided Populist gains in the con
gressional elections in the coming
fall. It is to be hoped, too, that
their anticipations may be realized,
for the Populistst-barring a few
of his extremer views- is in essen
tials a Democrat elected from a Re
publican district. He is a better
Democrat than most of the con
gressmen elected on the l)emocra
tic ticket.--Chicago Times, (Dem).
The cash value of the estate of
the late Dr. A. B. Miles, the cele
1ted New Orleans specialist,
was $80,000. True to his profession
even in death he bequeathed $10,

ity Hospital and Tulane University
of the same city.-Progress.
