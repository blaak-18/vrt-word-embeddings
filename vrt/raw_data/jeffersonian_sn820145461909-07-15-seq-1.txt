WHERE DOES THE CONSUMER
COME IN?
In the course of the tariff debate
in the Senate a few weeks ago the
following statements were made in
connection with the prices charged
to the consumer:
Senator Flint—l call attention to
the cost of a 100-piece dinner set of
Haviland & Co.’s make. It was in
voiced to their New York house at
$5.77; packing charges, 46 cents;
custom-house advance to make value,
58 cents; total, $6.81. The duty at
60 per cent, is $4.08, making a total
cost of $10.89. That set of Haviland
china is selling in the city of Wash
ington for $36. There is a profit of
about $26 on those articles.
I call the attention of Senators to
a number of other small articles. I
take Japanese chinaware. Blue-print
cups and saucers pay a duty on a val
uation of 3 % cents per pair, includ
ing packing charges, paying a duty
of 60 per cent., or 214 cents per pair.
These goods sell in Washington at 3 5
cents a pair, or almost 1,000 per
cent, over the value at which they
pay duty. The consumer pays 214
cents duty on a 3 5-cent purchase, or
6 3-7 per cent.
The same proportion holds good
on the following items: Plates, du
tiable price, 3% cents; retail price,
35 cents each. Egg cups, dutiable
price, 1 2-3 cents, sell for 15 cents
each. A tea set, composed of teapot,
sugar, cream and six cups and sau
cers, cost 41 cents, with duty paid,
and is selling in the stores in Wash
ington for $3.50. An article costing
41 cents is selling at retail for $3.50,
and these are the prices charged by
the large department stores through
out the country. When you come, to
small places in lowa, Kansas, Ne
braska and the Dakotas the prices
are from 20 to 30 per cent, in addi
tion to that.
Senator Scott —Mr. President, I
disiike to delay the Senate, but I
made a statement a week or ten days
ago in which I said that before there
was any duty on glassware, pitchers
cost anywhere from three to four
dollars, and that now they could be
bought for $1.25 a dozen. Here (ex
hibiting) is a pitcher, a half-gallon
pitcher, which can be bought at the
factory for 90 cents a dozen —not
apiece, but a dozen. * * *
Senator Newlands —Let me ask
the Senator now at what price does
the retailer sell that pitcher?
Senator Scott —I cannot answer
the Senator that point. I could
possibly go down the street and as
certain. But I presume the consumer
would have to pay from 40 to 50
cents for the pitcher,

Senator Newlands For each
pitcher? That would be $4.80 a
dozen.
Senator Smoot —Take, for in
stance, the manufacture of razors. I
have an invoice where the manufac
turer charges $3.95 for a dozen ra
zors. The jobber in St. Louis se
cures a 2 per cent, discount for cash
in ten days upon the article. He
jobs the article that cost him $3.95
with 2 per cent, discount in ten days
for $9 a dozen. The retailer sells
every one of those razors for $2
apiece.
Senator Lodge—-Tea that costs in
x ew York 16 cents a pound landed
and everything paid is retailed for
60 cents a pound.
Senator McLaurin —That is near
ly 400 per cent.
Senator Flint —Mr. President, the
Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Mc-
Laurin) a moment ago called atten
tion to clothing. I have an illustra
tion as to clothing, to which I
thought I would call his attention,
which shows, as I contend, that even
with woollen goods the duty is not a
factor in increasing the price to the
consumer. I understand that the
cost of the cloth, bindings and finish
ings of all kinds of a $lO suit is
about $2.25.
Senator Gore Take the con
sumer; take the ordinary citizen.
How stands the count with them?
Begin, sir, with the hat upon his
head. Take the Stetson or Knox
hat, and, for aught I know, other va
rieties, and the retailer has to sell
those hats to the consumer at a fixed
price. He has no choice and has no
discretion. Take the shoes upon his
feet, and every standard pair of
shoes in the United States is sold to
the retailer upon the express condi
tion that he will sell it to the con
sumer at a fixed price, and he has no
liberty, he has no option.
Is the retailer responsible in that
case? Nay, sir. Take the clothing
upon his back. The same thing holds
true. Suppose he wears a suit made
by Hart, Schaffner & Marx. The re
tailer purchases that suit upon the
express condition that he must sell
it to the consumer at a fixed price,
and if be varies from that price but
by the breadth of a farthing, he does
so at his peril and runs the risk of
forfeiting other business from the
same concern. * * *
I ask the Senator with reference to
Manhattan shirts, Earl & Wilson’s
shirts. Does the Senator say in that
case the retail merchant is the rob-
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, July 15, 1909
ber who outrages the consumers of
this country?
Sir, this is a miserable sham in
vented by the manufacturers. Driv
en to desperation in order to defend
themselves against their outrages
and in order to shield themselves,
they indict and they malign the re
tail dealers of the United States.
THE DUTY ON THE BLANKETS OF
THE RICH AND OF THE POOR.
Senator Cummins, of lowa, has im
pressed us heretofore as a broad
minded, intensely sympathetic “in
surgent’' Republican statesman whose
heart bleeds at every throb when the
merciless and greedy Aldrich puts
the tariff into the long-suffering con
sumer. But it seems that the lowa
Senator’s sympathy is of an uncertain
and eccentric quality. For example,
when the Senate was considering the
wool and woolen schedules of the
Tariff bill Senator Gore, of Okla
homa, offered an amendment limiting
to 75 per cent, ad valorem any duty
imposed upon woolen blankets. The
Oklahoma Senator explained that the
duty levied under the provisions of
the Senate bill on blankets used by
the poor Is as high as 160 per cent,
ad valorem, although the tax on the
finest blankets used by the rich does
not exceed 71 per cent.
But this impressive statement did
not evoke a sympathetic response
from Mr. Cummins. His heart does
not “bleed,” it appears, when Mr. Al
drich imposes a tax of 160 per cent,
on the “poor man’s blanket.” Seven
“insurgent” Republican Senators —
Brown, Bristow, Burkett, Clapp, Dol
liver, La Follette and Nelson —voted
for Senator Gore’s amendment. Mr.
Cummins voted against it. Evidently
he is of the opinion that the “poor
man” ought not to have the degrad
ing and demoralizing privilege of
“cheaper blankets.” In President Ben
jamin Harrison’s administration the
uncompromising protectionists pro
claimed that a “cheap coat made a
cheap man.” On the same line of
reasoning Mr. Cummins may have
convinced himself that a reduction
of duty from 160 per cent, to 75 per
cent, on the blankets of the hardy
yeomanry of the nation and of the
millions of toilers in all branches of
industry would result in their deca
dence. Let the rich degenerate un
der a 71 per cent, tax, but at all haz
ards let the poor pay 160 per cent,
on their bedclothes and thereby pre
serve the virility and the indepen
dent spirit of the masses.
We fear the “poor man” will not
understand and appreciate the mo
tives which prompted Senator Cum
mins to vote against a proposition to
cheapen the price of blankets and
thrifty shepherds of the West—the
wool producers—and the New Eng
land manufacturers of blankets will
applaud Mr. Cummins’ vote. Mr.
Aldrich will rise up and call him
blessed. But when the season of
frost and blizzard and nipping cold
comes again the poor man may be
inclined in his dull, unreasoning,
prejudiced way, to be resentful. He
will never be able to comprehend
why the rich man should be required
to pay only 71 per cent, duty on his
blanket, while the man of slim purse
must pay 160 per cent. It may be
desirable that the poor should not
have the blessing of abundant bed
covering at reduced prices. They
might be made to feel so snug and
comfortable on wintry mornings that
they would oversleep themselves.
They might become sybaritish in
their habits, unfitted for hard work
and early rising. They can under
stand a policy of “freeze” on the
part of Mr. Aldrich, but they will
surely be dazed by Mr. Cummins’ ex
hibition of the marble heart—espe
cially when he has made repeated
and fervent professions of his sym
pathy with the masses—of a passion
ate yearning to promote their wel
fare in zero weather as well as in the
dog days.—Baltimore Sun.
FARMERS IN POLITICS.
Os course the politicians want
farmers to let politics alone. The
clan of robber barons who control
the prices of bread and coal, want
to be let alone. Os course they do.
Every man who has a dishonest pur
pose in his life wants his business let
alone. Oh, yes, farmers will keep
out of politics when professional pol
iticians become honest men. They,
only want their employees in the
legislature and public offices to do
their work honestly and faithfully,
and then they will let them alone.
But so long as these servants are
cowards, time-servers, dissimulators,
toadies and other pleasant things too
numerous to mention, just so long
will farmers keep in politics, and
contrive to go in deeper until they
have driven out enough of “the ras
cals” to get justice for themselves.
Farmers should go into politics, and
go into politics, and go in to stay.—-
