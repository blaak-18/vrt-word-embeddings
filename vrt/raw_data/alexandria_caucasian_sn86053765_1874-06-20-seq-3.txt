Taxation and Confiscation
toches Parish.
In onr reply to an article of the Re
pnbllciin, we had not space to explain
what appeared strange to the Republi
can, namely : That we ehonld meddle
«ri th the affairs of Natchitoches, in
stead of attending to our own. Of
ours, we have, nothing to com
plain beyond the nsnal ijrnnr
ance and imbecility which
represents iK»jrro government. If m
addition to their ignorance, onr Police
Jury had organised a ring and com
menced issuing Parish paper for and
placing it in judgments for tlie.purpose
of public plunder, we would have writ
ten no article, nor had any public
meeting about it, but quietly hung up
the scalaway and carpet-baggers and
ring masters engaged in it to a lamp
post as we would other highwavmen.
Our meddling with' the affair of
Natchitoches, wa^partiy*Ticci»h>.ntal.
We were lofldcing around fijf a striking
illustration of negro and carpet bag
government, and we could find none
so striking as that of Natchitoches.
We know, that there, skillful hand*
hands had for years, been busy in
dressing in the garb of legislation, and
judicinl proceedings, a robbery worse
then that of the highwayman. We
know that those who manipulated
robberies, go clothed in purple and
linen and fare sumptuously everyday,
while llio toiling thonsands struggle in
vain to preserve their homes from con
fiscation by the tax-gatherer. We
know tha»; when Police Jurors were to
he appointed, there was no ignorance
and incompetency too gross, prov.ided
it was black, and no villain too mon
strous, (provided its owner was a car
pet-bagger or a 8callawag), to be en
titled to the favorable consideration of
the Governor. We know that in the
midst of a community, in which there
were intelligent and successful mer
chants, Doctors, Lawyers and Plauters,
whose high honor and moral worth$.i
would entitle them to rank w
people, the Governor for members
the Police Jury, had sou «lit out poor
beeoted negroes, whose ignorance was
as fathomless -»as ni;;ht—who did not
know that th#ft and bribery wer«? a
dishonor, nor peijnry a 6iu—who
thought their highest duty was to
obey the dictates of the villains who
led them. " @
That in the midst of honor and in
tegrity and moral worth, the Governor
had hunted out men who had trampled
nuder foot the laws of society and been
converted to Republicanism and smiled
and fawned upon the lap of the negro
foT the hopo of vomc petty olflcc. The
only qualification required, was will he
l»e obedient to the ring Î Will he aid
in confiscation T if so he is loyal, and
9 fit juror. "lie is all this for the ring
has sent in his name." We thought
such a state of affairs, must on its ad
ministration afford an illustration of
"unswerving Republicanism," that
oiijiht to bo given to the world. l!iit
with all this we never dreamed of the
fathomless depths of its iniqifity.
Without a single imptovemt nt or mii v
other cause of extra expense, the peuple
of Natchitoches have Dk<en tax^d, for
Paiish taxes alone 20 nnlt ^ w w ftie dol
lar for 18*0, .'?0 mills for 1871, 45 mill»
for 1872 and 04J for ]873 5i? $!)5 000 h;is
been paid in greenbacks and about $55
600 iu paiish paper and greenbacks —
still a debt of about $80 000 to pay.
We wish tljat the tax notices which the
collector has distributed through Nat
chitoches were sent to every paper in
the North for publication. The New
York Times says the Governor of
South Carolina is a thief, and the legis
lature a den of thieves. What would
it say of the Police Juries of Natchito
ches and the Governor, who appointed
them and the ring who manipulated
them, if it were to see some of these
tax notices 1 Wo marvel at the peo
ple of Natchitoches in permitting them
selves to be thus plundered by a taxa
tion which lias uot the shadow of law
for its support, and plundered by
whom 1 By a few ignorant regroes and
carpet-baggers and scalawags gho
without truth, without honor, without
integrity; the very dregs of society—
> laughing to scorn its inoials, am®'its
integrity and reveling upon its plun
dered wealth. Wo wish the world
could witness tlie scene and read its
lesson. Are the poople of Natchito
ches or of Louisiana to longer submit
to this degrading oppression 1 Some
of our ancestors left their property to
bo burned and their horned to be made
desolate by Tarlton, and lived with
Marion on potatoes and houiiny in the
swamps of Carolina, for the sake of
that American independence which re
fused to pay the British tax on tea.
We aro brought face to face, with a
tyrant a thousand times more oppres
sive, and whoso rule is a degradation
unspeakable. ®

The Verdict
Well may the foreman of the Jury
have handed it with trembling hands
and his co-partners hardly dared to
raise their eyes on their doomed vic
tims, the holocaust to be offered to
the vëngeance of their party. Guil
ty ! Guilty ofwbaj,? Guilty of con
spiring to defend their lives; guilty of
conspiring to prevent the .whole
country fr©m being laid in asheB
guilty of conspiring to prevent riot,
bloodshed, rape and all the concom
itants which generally accompany the
rising of a lawless mob.
The human mind almost shudders
at the thought, and tremblingly
awaits the next act of the drama.
The acquittal of five of the priso
ners amounts to nothing in the solv
ing of the question before the coun
try. Their case was a clear alibi, and
their couviction was an impossibility.
They were at home! .While the three
convicted prisoners were a part of the
noble band to whom we owe that we
are now alive, and our firesides un
molested. It is their case which is
our case; their conviction, our con
viction; their dungeon, our dungeon.
The blacks have gained the victory
and you can hear their demoniac
laugh, as they exultingly boast of the
»result. Where is the spirit of the
peop'e? Where are the men of the
land? Do tbey think they'can sit
Iowa at their ease and chuckle that
j he y are beyond the grasp of the iron
hand? No, a thousand times No»'

Emboldened by their success, will
they not fill our country with their
mercenaries, and surrounded as we
are, by a race in whose ears has been
instilled the creed, that everything
is lawful which leadä to our downfall;
where will be our security ? Driven,
tracked and hunted, our tenantless
homes and deserted fields will stand
as a memento that not daring, we
lost all, the victims of policy and in
difference. B
The verdict of that Jury has placed
the question of races squarely before
us, aud the parishes of Grant and
Rapides have to decide it. They can
not evade it, nor can they heal the
wound by compromise. Eight of
their fellow citizens have stood their
trial, accu&ed and prosecuted by a
solid phalanx of suborned, peijnred
blacks, consistent and vindictive in
their hatred of our race. They are
now ready, willing and ansious to re?
new the trial. The privileged pets
of a soulless government, they con
sider themselves licensed to override
all rights and all laws. "
Under the promptings of such a
District Attorney and the rulings of
such a Judge, will they not place all
of us before the same" court? And
the very verdict which consens Ilad
not, Irwin and Cruikshank to a livins?
tomb, will people the government
prisons with our fellow-citizens.
Last year the blacks dared to force
the issue on these parishes and they
soon learoed that the Caucasian race
was still their master. To day, back
ed by an unprincipled government—
they have dared by perjury to con
demn three of our citizens, and have
prowess. Shall they be left to enjôy
their victory while oar brethren are
to moulder within the walls of peni

enough vitality left in the land to

T HE P auls à OF NATcnjietSrES
—We are inforhwidr-bs^tlie passen
gers on the Bart Able, aud by pri
vate letters that we have seen, that
serious trouble is threatened and
expected in . Natchitoches Parish.
Without doubt, she has been the
worst victim to negro and carpet
bag rule, of any parish in the
State, and the honest white people
seem to have just begun to realize
this fact, and to have determined to
put a stop to such a couditiou ot
tilings. We have heretofore had
considerable to- say about taxation
in that parish, aud have shown
from official notices sent to a citi
zen of this Parish who owns pro
perty theie, that the taxation there
is 90 mill^or 9 per cent. The rad
cal paper there is filled with tax
sales notices to pay this enormous
taxation. At some meeting or pub
lic accasion there a short time since,
the negro Senator from that Dis
trict, Raford Blunt, openly pro
claimed that the " negroes could
and would whip out the white peo
ple at any time." Serious trouble
is apprehended on the 27th inst.,
when there is to be another public
meeting.
Our advice to our Natchitoches
friends is, that if the negroes 8i«rt
any such programme, to take a firm
stand, and maintain it at all haz
ards. If they need any help Ra
pides is ready and willing in such
an emergency to come to their as ;
sistance. Take your stand aud let
us know if you want us.
The Ciiakbon .—From private
sources we learn that this fatal dis
ease is among the horses and cattle
4* °
in the lowef portion of this Parish,
and that the people ar$ sending
their stock t& the Pinewoods for se
curity. Three hundred horses and
mules passed up Bayou Bœuf a
day or two ago, and large numbers
nre to follow. From ' our Opelou
sas exchanges we learn that the
same disease is committing its rav
ages among the stock in St. Landry
Parish. We are afraid that it will
seriously interfere with the proper
cultivation of thecrops. There ap
pears to be no remedy for it. Our
planters hero had better begin to
prepare forits appearance.

The Maria Louise .—The citizens of
our town, and the country geoerally,
are freely expressing the : r disappro
bation of the very singular conduct
on her last up trip, of this hitherto
popular steamer. Bearing the latest
news of the Colfax trial, the first mes
senger to inform us of the result of
the trial, she rushed by, as we are in
formed, not being in town ourselves,
under a full head of steam» and with
out even throwing off a paper. The
pilot havinglhrown one t# » friend,
gave us-the only opportunity to
learn what wt were so anxious to
know.
This, taken in connection with the
fact that she had aboard the negro
purjurers who had helped to convict
our friends, and that they were
armed, as the "New Orleans papers
report, with army guns, and with the
other fact as reported, that she had
agreed to give McMickle one dollai
per head to secure their passage on
her, are topicg of general conversa
tion here and the popularity of the
Maria Louise is at a very low ebb.
We have known Red River captains
who would have refused to take the
purjurers either way on any terms.
" The White
It is not often that -the Morning
Star, has any thing to do with poli
tics, but when it does, it always dis
plays the same unusual "intelligence
upon that subject that it does upon
all others. The article below taken
from its editorial columns is a bold
and ontspoken expression of opin
ions similar to our own, and com
ing from such a soyrce, is entitled
to great weight. It goes even fur
ther than we have gone on the ne
gro question, and we are satisfied
that it is rights We must cairy the
question, home to the negro in snch
a .way that he can not fail to rçcog
hize its force:
We are informed by some of the dmly
papers that., throughout the country par
ishes. there is in formation an extensive
organization called the White Man's party
or tne White League. We are not inform
ed of the details of its make-np, but of one
thing we can be sure, that it will be -an
ntter'failure, if it is limited to voting.
The negrbes in this State are in a small
majority, if tbo hundreds of scurvy white
tricksters and the few honest white'Re
pnblicans are counted with them. -
That it is impossible, by any process of
reason of any lavishing of kindness, to
make the least'impression upon their po
litical unity lias been clearly demonstra
ted in the past. They are resolute anfl
unw.averiug in their war upon the white
race. That they arc, and have been, car
rying on a relentless war*Upon the whites,
is unfortunately too trne. It is nftt indeed
a war of arms, for in that they would not.
have the shadow of a- plmnce, and they
tbe army of Hherrffis and their desuties
ariuy of sheriffs and tlieir deputies
_ A negro congressman from Sonth Caro
lina, some time ago remarked in Washing
ton that tbey like to pile "on the taxes in
his State, because it makes land ebéap.
Similar sentiments are reported.to have
been recently expressed in this State, and
there is good reason to believe that there
is a deliberate and well understood con
spiracy to heap on taxes until landed pro
perty shall have become a bnrden and
shall lapse into the possession of the State
as a forfeiture for its unpaid imposts. We'
would i\ot be guilty of the Injustice of in
cluding all tbe negroes and colored people
iu this charge ot conspiracy and in other
charges made in this article. Wé know
that many of tliem have* had no intention
of injuring the white population, lint were
merely actuated by a foolish idea that it
was necessary to protect themselves
against the whites. Still, innocently or
maliciously, they have all joined iu the
war.
Aud how lias the white race met this
war? We must answer, weakly Very
weakly. They have shown no courage,
no spirit of sacrifice, nopublis spirit what
ever, in meeting the emergency. Ou tbe
contrary they have met this open insolent
defiance of these unscrupulous partisans,
with the most accommodating submissive
ness. So far from breaking off relations
with them as a public enemy, which they
arc in every true sense of the word, - every
planter, every employer, has run a race
with his compeers as to which of them
could employ the greatest number of ne
groes. They are kept fully occupied every
where. By this means they are furnished
ifcitii the ability to carry on that very war
which they wage so relentlessly against
their employers. The white man supplies
them with tood, clothing and money
They glow fat, strong and insolent. They
go to the polls and defiantly vote to ruin
the very man who weakly and stupidly
warms into life and strength the reptile
which lie knows is Stinging him.
There is but one way now to manage
the negro? He is, as a class, amenable to
neither reason nor gratitude. He must be
starved into the common perceptions of
decency. Let, hi m go to his own race.br
his carpet-bag friends for employment.
Let no man hinder him in carrying on
such avocations as may suit him, but cer
tainly iio one is bound .to patronize or en
courage him with employment. If they
are the superior race, as they so insolently
assume in practice, this course can be of
no consequence to them, while if they are
really dependent upon the whites for eve
ry element of comfort, civilization and,
even, life, they may thereby bo brought
to tlieir senses.
Rut we doubt very much whether our
planters can be influenced to any unity of
action on such a line of policy. . They
can't bear tlie idea of a bale of cotton or
a hogshead of sugar the less. Yet with
out cutting as deep as this, the White
Man's party will not roach the root of
the evil
A" Proposed Programme.
[From the New Osleans Picayune.]
We publish below an editorial
from the isew Orleans Ticayune,
which expresses our views exactly.
The coming campaign is a local one,
aud 5f we are foolish enough to
make anything else out of it, we
will most certainly meet with the
failure which we will justly ®merit,
for our want ot common sense aud
political foresight:
We have observed, with steadily
increasing amazement and disgust,
that at the opening of every cam
paign in Louisiana the political
wiseacres lay great stress on receut
events at the North—speak of
Democratic victories in Connecti
cut, refer vaguely to the " sober
second thought of the country,"
aud mumble over all the restottliat
wretched twaddle which for so
many dreary years has passed cur
rent as political wisdom. Just as
our noble army of ward-buinmers
claim the support and countenance
of the community by virtue ot qual
ities which they alone are able to
discover, so do the more advanced
and conspicuous frauds proceed to
tortify their assurances of «»coming
victory by.recitals of Democratic
achievements in remote quarters
of the globe.
It has been foing on foi a very
long while". We remember how,
in 1868, during the Presidential
campaign, somebody patented the
discovery that Connecticut had jpst
gone» Démocratie, and how w,e
screamed wildly for Connecticut,
and saw by one supreme intuition
that the Republican party, was top
pling to its fall, We remember the
same thing in 1872, when Connec
ticut repeated the operation, and
when we construed it as anotber
awakening, from Radical stupor and
another sure forerunner of Repub
lican destruction. The memoty of
all these poor, stupid, contemptible
little puerilities comes over us as
the speech-making epidemic breaks
out and we bear of fresh harangues
which reek with the old iinmeasur-.
able folly. •
The issue now before us is a
purely local one. We are trying to
get a decent Legislature—to dri^e
but the horde of thieves and plun
derers who for so long have fasten
ed upon us, and under whose reek
less and brutal misrule we are well,
nigh ruitied past all hope. The
question is local, vital, imme<Iiaté r -<*<
as nearly, one of lite and' death a®
any political question cau be—and
yet there are men, professing to be
patriots and aspiring to be leaders,
who will come before an eager, anx
ious assemblage, and drivel about
their own deserts, aud trot Out their
wretched little oratorical puppets,
and never'so much as hint at à ra
tional plan for destroying the car
pet bagger or restoring -our affaire »

cut or Illinois or Missouri or any
other State doe« go Democratic ; it
might be pertinently inquired
whether we ever derived auy bene
fit from Northern Democrats either
in Congress or in their respective
States ; but everybody knows that
events have answered these ques
tions, and that to pin our bopes on
sucb things is the very, baldest im
becility. - • *
W T hat we want is a native, white,
honest and intelligent Legislature
in Louisiana , aud tbe men chiefly
in demand just now are those who
will show us how to' get it. "Vybat
Connecticut did last month, or
what the United States may do iu
1876, amounts absolutely to noth
ing in the present emergency. The
election of Eaton in New England
hasn't reduced taxation here, nor
will a Democratic victory two years
hence do us much good if the ne
groes and carpet-baggers remain in
power meanwhile. We want to
beat our enemies now—this summer
—and right here at home. We
want to stop the robbery and plun
der, to destroy the robbers, • and to
resume our proper attitude as mas
ters of Louisiana.
Put us in the way of doittg these
things, gentlemen, and next fall we
promise to take a profound interest
in Connectient Democracy, or even
in the dissemination ot red flapnel
shirts and moral pocket baudker
chiel's_amoug the heathen. • Until
then, suppose we devote ourselves
to homo affairs.
