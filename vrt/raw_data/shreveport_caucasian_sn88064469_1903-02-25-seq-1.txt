THE STRIKE ARBITRATED
THE HAPPY ENDING OF A
LABOR PROBLEM.
Mayor Andrew Querbes as Pacificator
and Adjuster-Text of the Agree
ment as Finally Signed.
Monday afternoon the differences be
tween the striking linemen and the
Southern Construction Company were
settled amicably and satisfactorily, as
also the electric light and traction com
pany. The committee of the Electrical
Workers and A. Querbes, who by spe
cial request represented the Construc
tion Company, reached the agreement as

Workers Local Union No. 194 of the city

lows:

Per F. B. UJfer, Supt.
The signatures of the committee with
that of Mr. Ufer confirms the agree
ment. Having done his part conscien
tiously and well, there was no need of a
"grand-stand play" by A. Querbes, but in
a sense of fairness and justice, he has
again demonstrated that he is a better,
a more substantial friend of the working
man, of honest labor, than the few who
have been prancing about and around as
the champions of labor.
It may be said in this connection that
an amicable and satisfctor)r settlement
is being made between the linemeittanl
the Camberlaird Telephone Company.
The lesson which may be drawn is
plain. Arbitration is the only medium
through which misunderstandings or dif
ferences between capital and labor' may
be settled fairly and peaceably. It is bet
ter than throwing rocks or bricks at the
"seabs." It is more prseitable than losing
time or jumping on the other fellow and
giving him a thrashing. It is better than
cutting wires or doing any act whicr is
not law fat In a lawful community no
imtlawful acts, acts -which endanger life
Sproperty, can be o shall e toler
t jf a t tthe'bgiaming oFtbhe strike the
WiafWrrs Had appealed to ar
E re l4 w.or
D the only medium of proper settlement.
With arbitration in view and as the
medium through which all wrongs may
be righted, there can be no strike or
labor upheaval. The great apostle and
leader of labor, the man 'who never
played or plays to the gallery or would
pose for a few "hurrahs" or a little no
toriety or a political job, John Mitchell,
e- has declared that if the trades union
he movement depended on violence for its
re success he would abandon it. He said
as that strikes had been lost because the
n laws were broken, and he contended that
al capital and labor should meet face to
e- face and discuss their differences. John
c- Mitchell is too big a man to be hurt by
s the little things that yelp at his feet. And
we may add that John Mitchell, while
le the champion of labor, is no friend of
1e the demagogue or the politician who
al would use the working people for their
y own selfish greed and political success.
While on this subject the Caucasian
st would suggest a medium of arbitration.
t. In brief, we would recommend as a pro
s gressive movement a committee of five
d arbitrators, a permanent committee, two
> to be named by the trades unions, one by
Mayor Querbes and one by Judge A. D.
3 Land, and these four to select the fifth
man. This committee of five when organ
ized should then formulate such rules
and regulations as would govern all alike
and be in full force and effect when
trouble or differences arise for settle
n ment. With such a board a strike would
r be unnecessary and all wrongs could be
righted speedily.
SHREVEPORT'S FIRE PROTECTION
Report of a Leading Special Agent
Shows Many Improvements.
The Vindicator: After A careful in
spection of and investigation into fire
protection conditions at Shreveport, a
s well known special agent has sent an ex
s haustive report to his company. All com
c panies interested in Shreveport business
e would do well to secure -a copy through
e their local agente at that point as the
I report contains much valuable informa
tion.
It is shown that within the'past few
years many improvements, have been
made in building constractiolg :is th.
paving of-streets, .a i fie " tmi f
equipment, whi~t the substantial business
interests of the city have grown and
prospered to a remarkable degree. The
!old mercantile buldings'are very poor;
Sbut those of later construction indicate
an improvement in this class of risk.
Stocks average from fair to good. The
old frame buildings and contents are
undesirable.
Dwellings average very good, particu
larly those constructed within the last
few years, and there has been consider
able improvement in; the character of
flues by reason of the enf6rcement of the
flues ordinance and a penalizati(n -of
metal flues. The dwellings built twenty
to. twenty-five years ago are, as a rule,
undesirable.
' The fire record, for the last five years
has been poor, but there has been a
marked, improvement "in this respect
within the past ydar'or' eighteen months.
The premiumn'eceipts for last year were
approximately. $oo0,ooo with losses about
$4o,o0oo. This does not include outside
business, which, it is reported, was un
satisfactory to the comlianies.
The condition of the fire protection is
very good, but efforts are still being
made to improve the fire department.
On account `of the poor buildings in
blocks 4i, 49, 50, 5, 58 and 59, and the
large values which are contained in
these buildings a conflagration hazard
exists, but it regarded as prc ble that
a fire Could be confined tQ any one of
these blocks under favbrable conditions,
and because of the improved condition
of the fire department the chances for a
conflagration ate much less than hereto
fore.
The condition of the electrical installa
tions has been much improyed within the
last eighteen months through thie en
forcement of the National Electric Code.
The water supply is adequate and thq
condition of the pumping station is very
creditable. Additional water maivs are to
be laid, and more hydrants are to be
put in, The water pressure in the brisi
ness section is from seventy to seventy
five pounds; in residence section sixty
fire pounds. The new Gamewell fire
alarm system is adequate.
To quote from the report: "Chief
O'Brien is active, progressive, and seems
to be making every effort to improve and
keep the department up to the greatest
point of iGiciency: As far as I am able
to j~dge, the Sbsrtepart de~iraint at
present is free from political dontrol, and
entirely in the hands of the chiedf, whoi
impresses me as being a good man"

CASTRO IS RESTLESS.
Representatives of the Allied Powers
Assert That the Vessels Will Be
Given Back as Soon as
Formalities Are Over.
Washington, Feb. 25.-Advices were
received at the state department from
Mr. Russell, the United States charge,
at Caracas, to the effect that none of
the Venezuelan vessels captured by the
blockading fleet had been returned at
yet, and that there was considerable
confusion in the public mind as to the
reading of the protocols on this point
In the absence of the texts of the
agreements, which have not arrived.
President Castro does not know wheth
er he should send his crews to Trini
dad, where the ships are being held.
or whether he should insist upon their
return to Venezuelan waters.
Minister Bowen has received sev
eral cablegrams from President Castro
regarding the action of the allies in re
taining the ships, and is evidently
growing restive at what he considers
a breach of trust.
The allies representatives, here,
however, take the position that the
ships will be returned as soon as'the
"necessary formalities have been en
acted."
The British ambassador has seen
Secretary Hay .regarding the matter
and assured him that the London gov
ernment was doing everything possible
to expedite the return of the ships.
and that the foreign office was having
the co-operation of the adniralty in
this effort.
After a lengthy conference with
high officials of the Washington gov
ernment, Mr. Bowen announced that
he would call on the Italian and Brit
ish ambassadors and the German al.
ister and inform them he was ready
to proceed with the drafting of the
protocols providing for the proceedure
to be followed ia referring the prefer
entlals to The Hague. Mr. Bowen de

A Son c* Bossier in New York--iIis
Success.
New York, Feb. i8.-North Louisiana
may be justly proud of her many sons
and daughters who have attained promi
nence in intellectuaT achievements at
home and abroad. Even here in New
York, the Mecca of America, where
come those of every profession eagerly
seeking name and fame, and where only
the strongest and best achieve success,
we find men and women from Louisiana
in the front rank. Among these is one
who has attained celebrity in literary and
newspaper circles-Homer Fort-one
of the most popular writers in New
York.
About twenty-three years ago 'ir.
Fort began his newspaper career in
Shreveport. Desiring a larger field, he
vent to New Orleans, and finally came
to New York where his ability was soon
recognized. For several years he was
engaged on the leading dailies. He writes
pure English, both in prose and verse.
His versatility and great success as an
interviewer caused a constant demand
for his articles.
Mr. Fort hes arrived at that happy
stage in a newspaper man's life when it
is no longer necessary for him to do
staff work. His articles find a ready ac
ceptance by the leading periodicals
throughout the country. Successful as
he has been in the past, the future
promises still greater things. He has
lately written a play, which those who
have read the manuscript give him first
rank as a dramatist. A rich New Yorker
has shown his confidence in its success
by offering to "back" Mr. Fort in its
production. Next fall the play will be
presented on the New York stage. Those
who are familiar with Mr. Fort's lucid
style, keen wit, vivid imagination and
horough knowledge of- human nature
ire sure of its success. X.
