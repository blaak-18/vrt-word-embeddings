C:apt. Pharr and his campaign
ing party received one continued
ovation through Calcacieu, Aca
dia and St. Landry parishes las
week.
Bands of music and great crowds
of people met them at every ap
pointment, and the anxiety and
enthusiasm of the people showed
the galling effect of the burdens oF
Fosterism.
Such meetings and such recruits
as the Dusons and the Garlands,
point unmistakably to a sweeping
victory m South Louisiana.
It remains for North Louisiana
to decide the fate.
Populists and free silverites, and
all others desiring honest elections
and honest government, come oul
and bear him defend your cause.
Break the rings and restore the
government to the people by elect
ing "the old swamper," a man of
the people for Governor.

An official will hardly be much
better or worse than those who
elected him to office. He is usual
lya fair exponent of those who
elevate him to official position.

SThen may the good Lord deliver
as from Foster's re-election.
Look in our cartoon and see the
comnany he keeps in New Orleans.
Part of that company is mnow in
the penitentiary despite Foster'l
efforts to keep it out, a larger part
is is jail awaiting trial, and the
rest are working for the re-elee
tion of Fester and Fitzpatriek.
Then remember Kellogg and
Coge's trip to Baton Rouge on
Democratic campaign funds, to
speak to 8000 negroes mn thie n
terest of Foster, and you have a
fair idea of Foster's company, sand
the kind of Governor be will make
during bi second term.

Judge Henry L. Garland, Sr.
one of the landmarks of democra
cy in St. Landry, yesterday an
nounced his allegiance to the Pharr
ticket. In a ringing speech, in
which no words were minced, and
no quarter shown to Murphy J.
Foster, he cut loose from the moor
ines of technical democracy and
joined Gunby and Duson, who had
gore bfoere.
The desertions from the ranks
of Fosterism are increasing in
numbers and in political power as
the campaign progremsses. Every
where strong men, who formerly
battled in the democratic ranks,
are enlisting under the Pharr ban
aer. They can no longer endure
the metbods of the fraud and trick
ster who, by soan sort of iog
glery, wa placed at the head of
tildemocratio ticket.

The Country Blstriet and the
Ballot zoxea.
The Item is not fond of war,
nor does it delight in bloodshed.
So long as the rights of the people
can be scucred by peaceful nmoans
under the forms of law. The
Item urges strict compliance with
the statutes.
Buit it begi:as to be clearly de
monstrated that the Foster man
agement in this campaign does not
intend that an honest election shall
take place in April next, The
methods shown in all the prelimi
nary events-the registration, the
granting of representation in the
polling booths-go to prove that a
free ballot and a fair count is not
a part of the plans outlined by the
well-known political freebooters
who are attending to tae "inside
work" required to land the Foster
ticket.
To be forewarned is to be fore
armed, and The Item now sonads
a note of warning to the friends of
fair and honest elections in the
country district of Louisiana. It
may as well be understood now as
later that the only hope of secur
ing an honest vote in April lies in
the strong right arms and the phy
sical courage of the good people
of the State. Under the forms of
law the Foster management in the
several parishes will commit the
most unblushing frauds. Only the
fear that the people will rise in
their might and destroy those who
rob them will prevent wholesale
swindling.
Look st the Swords incident
in St. andry; the conduct of
"Judge" Long, the registrar of Jef
ferson ; the open boast in the Dem
ocratec press that "the Pharr tick
et shall not win." It is clear, as
The Item has before observed,
that all the triggers are set for the
political traps which are to eatch
the people. Upon physical force
alone must honest men rely. Sec
tion this and section that of the
election law are not half so edec
tive in securing a free ballot and
a fair count a one thoroughly
brave man, who will hold the per
petrators of fraud personally res
posi'ble
Our friends in the country dis
trist can rest assured that in the
city of New Orlem there will ke
ten thousand brave men at the
polls on election day. There will
be no false returns, nor will there
be nay voting of dead men and
repeaters. Here the battle iube
half fa an honest election au lres
dy ws. The psope do not ar
whether the Oea gives d s Lesg.e
representatio laIrd the polls or
at. Brave ines will tab repre
story.
To the country dltriet lbs Item
itnders a wald of advice. Organ
ls ·nowto ser your right in
will stromg up at th seene af

als n you show that a brave

The newly selected members of
the campaign committee met at the
courthouse to map out a plan of
campaign and transact such busi
ness as came Op.
The following resolution was
presented and unanimously adopt
ed:
We the campaign committee in
convention assembled, being com
prised of the original seven andI
one newly elected member from
twenty-four parishes, all present,
have this day upon the motion of
Dr. T. J. Tabor, of Webster, and
seconded by Mr. W. L. Shackle
ford, of Grant, adopted unsani
mously the following resolution:
Resolved, That we, the cam
paign committee of the People's
Party, send greeting to our breth
ren in Union, Lincoln, Bossier, and
all parishes not represented at this
meeting, asking them to call mass
meetings in their respective per
umhe and do as a great majority
of the parishes have done in mass
meeting ratify the action of the
state central committee held at
this place on the 98d day of Janu
ary, and elect a member to act as
campaign committeeman for the
present campaign.
Mr. Waddll, of New Orleans,
made a very pretty play to make a
Booth campaign by voting the
proxies of New Orleans, if same
were admitted, but the committee
did not have say wool over its
eyes, and Mr. Waddell ran against
a snag before he had begun to
sail.
In the afternoon Mr. Osborne,
of Georgia, interested the audienee
with a speech which was the best
w ve ever heard in the line.
The meeting adjorned about 11
o'clock p. n., subject to call.-La.

Editor Populist :
I notice the Enterprise has some
thing to my about my having the
negroes registered in Ward 8, but
it failed to mention the fact that
the Democratic candidate for the
same position had an extra lat-boat
to cross the negroes over and reg
ister, and is also electioneering
with the negroes.
