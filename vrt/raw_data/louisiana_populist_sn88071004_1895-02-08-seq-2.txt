All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be

our friends to vive us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be

support it. Also those who enter
homenteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.

ttas every sensible leader of our
party will in the end admit, and
we are not at all uneasy about the
verdiot of the People's party as to
our course.
We have tried to be fair in this
tfght and have succeeded. We
have published articles from both
sides but drew the line at personali
ties until we were forced into it by
your article appearing in a paper
which vou had always denounced.
We would gladly have publish
ed snch sensible articles in favor
of prohibition as Bishop Durier's
and Charity's, but they were given
to other papers and we were com
pelled to content ourself with pub
lishing answers to them from good
Populists who are subscribers and
regular contributors to this paper.
If such a course merits the
" charge of selling out, we hope the
man making it will have emanhood
enough to come straightout with it
and we will endeavor to give him
the pleasure of proving his charge.

A week ago last Friday evening
in order to attend court at Wien
field, where we had been summon
ed as a witness, we packed our
grip and family too, in one small,
but stout new buggy, with a good
team, and shook the dust(T) of the
streets of Natchitoches off our
feet, and turned oar faces east.

We were not troubled with dust
any more between Cane and Red

olposite St. MamIlice'just in time to
be too, late, for Uncle Primnus, the
ferryman, had deserted the cold
breezes of the river for his wife's
house, about a mile into the woods
o on the other side.
So after hallowing onrself hoarse,
with no response save a well de
t fined echo, and the boot of the
swamp owl, we turned about and
sought shelter, just as twilight was
e Lhding, with our good friend, Mr.
J. N. Johnson, and his estimable
family.
They opened wide their doors
and made room at their warm fire
side for us, who prior to that even
ing had been strangers there.
And how our hearts welled with
_ gratitude to them as the cherry em

The grand jury was a most ex
cellent selection, and while all the
bills found will doubtless prove un
palatable to the accused, we are
satisfied justice will be done by
thenl. After fnding 35 bills they
concluded their labors on Satur

Owing to a large criminal (locket
disposed of by a "bob-tailed" jury

the docket at this, the regular

We noticed that Hon R. L. Tan
nehill was unusually happy, and
upon inquiry found that a 9 pound
girl had made its appearance only
ten days before, and as it was the
fifth of that gender and ninth of
both, all robust perfect specimens
of childhood, he has great cause to
crow ovr ordinary folks. His
young but accomplished wife (sec
ond) who is sporting this fine girl as
h-r first should be pardoned for
any excessile pride or admiration.
We also cailed on Deputy Sher
iff Frank Shaw and his estimable
.ady who have only recently estab
lished a pretty little nursery with
one occupant, an 8 pound girl.
We also shared the hospitality of
Sheriff Crawford and Clerk L. D.
Jones, whose pleasant families
know so well how to entertain their
many friends, and they seemed to
be blessed with them while we
were there.
We spent a good portion af our
time in the office and at the home of
Editor B. W. Bailey of the Coin
rade, who ought to represent this
district in congress after the 4th
of next March. We found Mr.
Bailey one of the busiest men in
town. Setting type, making up
forms, editing a newspaper anad
trying to see everybody about sunb
scriptions during court week is no
mall job for one man, but Mr. Bai
ley gets thsough with it and has
tim~ne to entertain hiefriends. He
is a brother-in-law of our wife and
that may accountfor it.
Well, we got back home Sunday
evening after an absence of about
9 days, and found the POPULIST
better off than when we left it-in

a line of our writing appeared in
the other departments.
But notwithstanding the bad
weather, we had a pleasant trip
back to our old home.

the nmaonoia in front of his ances
trial home, now in the last stages
of decay, can be seen the bent form
of a man dressed in a blanket coat.
jeans pants, and a fifty cent wool
hat shading the brow of a once
proud southern planter from the
land of the Mocking bird aiA! the
Magnolia. Bent down not from
age but from trouble, caused by
low prices, usurious interest and
taxation, driven to desperation in a
few days he becomes i suicide.
Around the remains of that once
wealthy planter stands a sorrowing
widow and three daughters to take
a last look at the only hope they
had for a livlihood, in the land of
the mocking bird and the magnolia.
At the front gate of that once
grand old ancestral home stands
an old wagon with two old horses
attached to bear the remains of
that southern planter to his last
resting place by the marble and
granite monuments of his ances
tors with nothing to mark that
place but the land of the mocking
bird and the maggolia.
After a few days the widow holds
a consultation with her daughters
as they are now sorely in need of
legal advice and taking up a paper
calls out the list of :law firms and
foeling that she would he unable
to employ the larger ones comes to
this one, Mr. Smith, Attorney At
Law, as soon as she reads it out
alond one of the girls exclaimed,
Oh, *mamma I know him, hoe's so
nice I know he will atendl to it for
us.
In a day or two can be seen in a
dingy little office a seedy look
ing individual setting near a desk
on which is lying a magistrates
guide and a revised civil code as
from appearences his largest prac
tice has been in the Justice's court.
In his handhe ht hbalding a letter
asking his to ell as soon as he has
time (having lotE of that to spare)
he rises and in a hurried man
ner goes in search of convey
ance and in a few minutes leaves
town on a fifteen dollar pony in
great haste
In the next issue of the weekly
paper can be found an application
by the widow for the appointment
of administratrix, the succession
drags along perhaps eighteen
months and then advertised under
head of succession sale, the ances
tral home of that once wealthy
planter, in the land of the mocking
bird and magnolia.
Nothing more is thought of the
matter until some day in passing
by that plantation and some one
asked, who owns the place now,
answered Mr. DeSmndth an attor
ney in town.
DeSmith's oiaee in town now is
thoroughly refitted, full set of La.
Annual Reports, fine furniture and
everything complete, on entering
you can see him reclining in an
easy chair smoking a ten cent ci
gar, he is not alone, the Bfirm has
changed. The others seeing how
fast DeSmith was rising apply and
are taken into the firm and it now
reads, DeSmith, Jones, Caldwel
& Thomas.
DeSmith's next move is to organ
ihe a publishing company, known
as the DeSmith publishing Co. to
dit a weekly paper known as the
Farmers Friend, in the land of the
mocking nird and the magnolia.
At the next session of the police
jury the Farmers Friend is award
ed the public printing and thence
becomes the official organ of the
prish, in the land of the mocking
bird and the magnolia.
The Farmers Friend in a long
article lauding DeSmith before the
people as the great financier, a
lawyer of known ability refers
them to the ad. of DeSmith, Jones,
CaIldwell & Thomas Will prac
tice befre all the courts, (except
one and in that one above they will
get their just decrts)

delegates to an agricultural con
vention and the Farmers Friend
urges the selection of DeSmith on
the ground that he owns large
planting interests &c., aud he is
selected. In the land of the mock
ing bird and the magnolia.
In the next congressional cam
paign the Farmers friend urges the
nomination of Monsieur DeSmith
the owner of large planting inter
ests in the district and greatest fi
nancier of the day. The district is
thoroughly canvassed by that array
of talent, DeSmith, Jones, Cald-'
well and Thomas.
DeSmith receives the nomina
tion. Pledged to free coinage and
anti'option. The farmers rush to
the polls assured of the fact that
DeSmith will settle the financial
question, for the land of the mock
ing bird and the magnolia.
DeSmith is declared elected by
an overwhelming majority.
At the next session of congress
DeSmith arrives m Washington,
puts up at the principal hotel, his
arrival can be seen in the next
morning's issue of the Washington
papers, he is termed the great fi
uancier and attorney of known
ability and the owner of large
planting interests.
In the land of the mocking bird
and the magnolia.
The first caller to see M'r. De
Smith is Mr- Donblazer, the presi
dent of the Gould system of rail
roads. After an exchange of cards
which read thus: Hon Donblaz
er, President of the Gould: sys
tem of railroads..
Hon. DeSmith, of the firm of
DeSmith, Jones, Caldwell & Thom
as, Attorneys at Law, will prao
tice n all the courts. In the land
of the mocking bird and the mag
nolia.
Ah, says the president of the
Gould system of railroads, I am
gladtoknow you are still in the
practice of law aswe have e branch
running through your district and
I wish to employ counsel to look
after our interests.
DeSmith: Yes sir, I am not
debarred from the prartice of law
by my election to congress, ah, if
we can agree upon terms I will be
happy to serve you.
Donblaser: Our terms (to con
gressmen) oh no, to our attorneys
are ten thousand dollars a year.
DeSmith: Your terms are ac
cepted and I consider myself em
ployed. (He is employed not
bribed.)
Perhaps the next day the Hon.
DeSmith will be introduced and
among his newly formed acquain
tences he will meet the nresident
of the banking ansociation and as
that interest needs to be look af
ter, n the land of the mocking
bird and the magnolis, And they
agree upon terms at Ifteen thous
and dollars a year, is again em
ployed (not bribed.)
The sugar planters association
will hold a meeting and send a
delegatipn to Washington to look
after their interests and DeSmith
is again employed at five thousand
dollars a year.
DeSmith then Cproeeeds to the
agriculture department and sends
garden seeds to every farmer whos.
name he has on his list, and if he
has not enough seed to go around
he will get the speech of some man
from Pennsylvania on anti-options
who has the audacity to broach the
subject to congrees. In the mean
time the farmers will bring their
cotton to town and sell it for two
and a half cents a pound and per
haps while walking around low
spirited they will meetJones and
well what is DeSmith doing t
Jones: Well my friend you
know aLman cannot go to congress
nad go i like he was going to
make rails, he must learn the'
routine and get parliammatry rules
at his fingers end, (in the shape of
bank checks he might have added.)
After many inquiries Jones,
Caldwell and Thomas seeing the
constitusacy falling under the
slow process of this lpromised re
form legislation they hold a cau
cas.
Caldwell makes an address and
tells them something must be' done
to sidetrack DeSmith's constituency
from the main issue of the day,
free coinageand amti-option.
Jones rises and exclaims: Eu
reka, I have fodbd it.
Thomas: What is it?
Jones: Prohibition.
Caidwell and Thomas: The very
idea, the chanoes are we might di
vide themt and as you know a
house divided within itself must
fall. In the land of the mocking
bird and the magnolia.
