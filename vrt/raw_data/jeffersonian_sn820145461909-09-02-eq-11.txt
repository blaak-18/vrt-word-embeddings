names.
Second Prize: Sallie O’Guin, 13 years

DADDY JIM’S PICTURE.
Miss Louis Browne, of Lorane, Ga.,
wants to know if she won a prize in
the name contest, and goes on to say:
“There’s another thing I would like,
and that is for you to describe your
self as nearly as you can, and put it
in The Jeffersonian. Tell us if you
fought in the war. My papa did. He
has a great scar on his left arm,
where he was shot.”
(Now, it’s a curious fact that the
only requests for Daddy Jim’s picture
and description have come from girls.
The boys don’t seem to care a cent
who he is, or what he looks like. In
his judgment, it is the part of wisdom
not to publish his picture. Tell ydu
what to do—all of you. Get a piece
of white paper and a sharp pencil,
and draw a picture of Daddy Jim, as
you think he is, or ought to be. Mail
it to the club in the next two weeks,
and we will give a handsome prize
to the one who conies nearest to the
original; and other prizes for the sec
ond and third best. Boys and girls
who know Daddy Jim personally are
barred from this contest. We will
print the pictures that win the
prizes.)
A THOMSON VISITOR.
Here conies another little boy. I
was almost afraid to make the at
tempt, but seeing so many letters
from other little boys and girls made
me w r ant to write one, too. lam 11
years old. My home is in Garfield,
Ga. I am visiting in your town
(Thomson). I like it very much.
My papa does not take The Jeffer
sonian, but my grandpa and uncle
take it, and I love to visit them and
read your paper, especially the Post-
Card Club. Papa says he is going to
take it just as soon as he can; I am
anxious for him to take it. Would
be so proud if I could head the list
in this contest, but am afraid some
other little boy or girl will beat me.
—Horace Rucker, Garfield, Ga.
FROM MARSHALL, MO.
Seeing the name contest in your
paper, I decided to try my luck. My
ather is a subscriber to your paper,
and I spend much of my time in read
ing it, especially the letters to the
Post-Card Club. lam fourteen years
of age, and am a sophomore in the
ugh School. Would be delighted to
receive post-cards from other readers
and members of the club. —Ora
Marksburg, R. F. D. 5, Marshall, Mo.
LETTER FROM NEW MEXICO.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a Georgia
girl, but I live in New Mexico now;
and as I haven’t seen any letters from
here, I thought I would write and
send my list of names. Papa takes
both the Jeffersonians, and we all
like to read them. My name is Azi
lee, but papa calls me Tom Watson
about half of the time. He wanted
to name me Tom Watson, but mamma
did not think that would do for a
girl’s name. Since then, I have seen
several girls named that. How many
of Our Post-Card Club are tomboys?
I am. Well, if I see this in print, I
will write again and tell about New
Mexico. —Azilee Morgan, 12 years
old, Roswell, N. Mex.
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER.
My papa takes The Jeffersonian,
also the Jeffersonian Magazine. He
Clje ‘Jeffersonian
thinks there is nothing like them.
Papa is the only one in this commu
nity that takes your paper. Many
people come to our home to get papa
to read your writings to them, and
near him talk of Mr. Watson. I en
joy reading all the children’s letters.
I think some of them have such
bright anticipations of the future. I
will tell you all what I hope to be. I
hope to make a great lawyer, a grand
and noble man, like Mr. Watson;
live an independent life, and, above
all, be truthful and honest. I am
coming again, whether this finds its
way to the waste basket or not.—
Gaylord S. Nichols, 10 years old,
Cooper, La.
OLD KENTUCKY HOME.
Here comes a little Kentucky girl
to join your happy band. lam seven
years of age, with fair skin, blue
eyes and yellow hair. I go to school,
and am in the third grade. I love to
go to school. My teacher’s name is
Miss Nellie Cashman, and I like her
very much. My papa takes The Jef
fersonian, and we all enjoy reading
it, especially Grand-pop Kit. I
might have found more names, but
the sweat is falling off me like the
dew. —Hattie Jane Hendrick, Hard
insburgh, Ky.
COTTON AND BACK-ACHE.
How do you do, all of you? I am
feeling all right, thank you. We are
having such beautiful weather. It
won’t be very long before the cotton
bolls will be bursting forth, and the
fields will be white as snow. Oh me!
it makes my back ache to think of it.
I am thirteen years old. I go to
school at Pleasant Grove school
house. My brother is teaching there.
I like to go to school, and I like my
studies.—Lillie K. Brown, Villa Rica,
Ga.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
lam a little girl, 14 years old. I
live in the country with my papa and
mamma. My papa takes the weekly
Jeffersonian, and my youngest broth
er takes the magazine; and I like to
read them. I have read the letters
so much, until I thought I would
write one. I am sending in a list of
names. —Destie Lovvorn, Howels
Cross Roads, Ala.
BOYS ARE THE MEANEST.
I thought I would write and let
you know my opinion of boys. Boys
are the meanest things that ever liv
ed. There is not one out of ten that
is good. There may be some good
ones in the world, but there are not
many good around where I live. I
live in the country, about two miles
from Juliette, and I am going to
school to Miss Kate Smith. —Julia
Mae Dreskell, Juliette, Ga.

Three sisters write from Harlin
gen, Texas, and as we are crowded
for room this week, we will print the
letter of the youngest.
We had a nice overflow, and had a
nice time boating in our tank. The
storm destroyed some of our bee
hives, and some trees. I would like
to have a good education. My grand
pa takes the Watson paper and maga
zine. I have entered the contest, and
send a list of names, and if I don’t
get the prize I will not be discour
aged.—Lena Adams, 8 years old, Har
lingen, Texas.
A TENNESSEE GIRL.
Here comes a Tennessee girl to
join in your club. lam visiting my
grandfather this summer. He takes
The Jeffersonian, and I like to read

ing to enlighten the children. I will
come again soon.—Mary Ellen Wil
