Cotton is opening rapidly, and
with this favorable weather, will
be picked, ginned and marketed, t,
by the middle of October. Less
than half a crop will be made, and
as it opened about a month ealier
- than usual, soon all will be picked.
In some places there will be no
need for a secoond picking. Ex
capt in very few localities, the
corn crop is a complete failure.

We dislike to be put in the po
Iition of being a perpetual kicker, c:
but when we know anything to be a
wrong, we cannot refrain from s:
saying so. What we have to say 01or
is in reference to the insuring of t
the new court house,
Of course, after the buil ling
was accepted andl the otic-rs Ilmoved se
into it, it was business lil:e to have to
the building insuredl. The coin
nmitteo empnlwerc, I t", have siwhli

agencies who put in bids as fol
lows : Messrs. I*,ilee & Tuckter'.
- tif rell s were one per cent per Itn
j nun, 2 per cent for three years or a
21 per cent for five years ; Messrs. to
, Alexander, Hill & Blreazeale bid
3 per cent for five years, just 4
per cent higher than the other hid. i
s In the face of that fact, on mo- w
t tion of Mr. II. Raphael, Messrs.
Lemee & Tucker secured seven
thousand dollars, and the other
agency five thousand. ti
, The difference between the lids it
is only $25 00, but as it is paid by fi
the pari.,h, the plremniiln should go a
to the lowest bidder. As it is, it tl
costs the parish $25.00 more for five
years insurance than it should have
done.
Y We comment no further, as the d

e Them Potatoes."
ar.
We want the whole world to un- hl
be derstand that we have To0 bushels R
' of first-class potatoes, that we can- of
ut not sell for one cent per bushel, or, it
x- in fact, for anything; and that we
ve are raising a lot more to pile on it,
top of them. ti
he We want the McKinkly tariff i.
again! We niust have it ! If we
don't got it the lpauper labor of ni
ed "Yurrop" will rush in a flood of at
ve potatoes and undersell our pota- of
g toes! Horrible thought! They bt
it will sell their potatoes for half m
ut what we get for ours-which is of
be nothing! One half of nothing! ai
,n- Who can raise potatoes in compe- o
s .tion with the pauper labor of Yur- i
rop, and s-ll them for one-half of
nothing? It can't be did! For w
God's sake bring on your tariff-
,ti on a clean plate. p
at We want John Judas Carlisle to a]
come along and comfort us with t(
the information that the purchas- o
ing power of the dollar was never si
he so great as it is today ; and that I
the purchasing power of the pota
m- to was never so little; but that the o
is money-lenders do not deal in po- h
tatoes, and so we are all happy. s
* We wotld like for John Judas to b
come into our cellar and delivor an t
oration on this subject over "them t
potatoes." We have a club that t
of would just about fit into John's et
we cranial bumps, and we would want e
a" only one good whack at him-and e
ar- we would cover up the remains 9
with potatoes, and use the whole L
VN mess to manure our fields next e
year, and-raise more potatoes- r
uad under the single gold standard! t
S Now we want our daily papers
to take up this important question. t
1e- Set the scientists at work. Tell us
O" how rwe can live on potatoes-fried, t
i stewed, roasted, and in the shell;
Show we can weave potatoes into j
L. cloth and mend the dilapidationsI
caused by unscrupulous time ; how
we can pay our taxes with thcse
tspriceless esoulents; how we can a
"' rig a purchase that will turn pota- i
e toes into government bonds---bear- I

tial Mluddlle-Pl'rospects~ Are
S Good for Bryan, But Boodle
u Will Have to Ble Fought.
V We reformers in \\ adhington are
pestered with jocular inquiries front
k goldbugs and cuckoos as to our
ii choice for Vice-Presildent. They
e wish or allect to wish to know
n whether we favor Sewall or \Vat
son. Doubtless the venal and ig- T
y norant throughout the country tire
o the same inquiry at reformers, and
t- think that they have propoundle a
,r question which is a 1ose'r. All
r your re idlors should reply as I do,
1, that a higher power is runninlg this
0 campaign for financial independ
n ence and the rights of men, and lie
a will take care of the Vice Presiden
g tial muiddle, while meanwhile all I
o reformers, whether Populists, sil
g ver Democrats, or silver Republi
cans, will devote all their time and
energy to the election of Bryan.
- After all, the matter of the Vice
d(l Presidency is comparatively unim
portant. To the government the
-presiding officer of the Senate is
(I about as important as the fly which
g gets into the cab of an engine is to
a locomotive. Let us elect Bryan
president, which will give us con
trol of the Treasury, the Army, n
and the Navy, and we will hold a tl
hand which will range in the pot. d
One old gentleman, who was a
Is Republican, but is now a supporter h
a- of Bryan, said to me yesterday that N,
r, it is a pity that the Constitution I
ve will not permit of Sewall and Wat
sharing the office, and exercising 1
) its functions on alternate days, like
the two claimants to the throne in
ff "The Tar and Tartar." It would
indeed be funny to see one of the I
re two approach the other at mid
of night, it the Senate were holding
of an all night session, and in tones
of thunder demand the chair and
gavel, However, even if the Con- t
y stitution could be strained to per- I
Ldf mit of such an equitable settlement
is of the matter, confusion would re
o arise when Sunday came bringing
one day's work for miniisters and
one da3's rest for the balance of
r- mankind.
of It would never do for both to
or wear Vice-Presidential dignity on
that day and to attend the same
church. Just fancy the preacher t
praying for "our Vice-President"
to and the two claimants each trying
*th to look dignified, as though lie were
the one recommended to the care
s- of the Almighty! It Iould be a
er sight worth travelling to see, but
at I am afraid we shall never see it.
The Republicans are badly scar
ed by the marvellous revivification
he of the spirit of 1776. T.ht people
o- have for so long permitted them
y. selves to be humbugged, have so
to long been content to eat at the swil
barrel while the usurers and poli
an ticians lived on the fat of the land,
em that Hanna and his boodling crew
iat thought until recently that McKin
ley was virtually elected, and that
everything was over except the
mt shouting. Now they realire their
nd error, and every beneficiary of the
ins gold standard and other monopo
lies is having the fat fried out of
him as it never was before. An
3xt enormous campaign fund is being
i-- raised, but if the people can be in
duced this year to sell their birth
right for a mess of pottage, I am
e much mistaken in my estimate of
Dn. the situation.
us Thie Republican managers intend
od to hire bicyelsts in all the doubt
tul states and send them out to
scatter lying literature and utter
to falsehoods. All who openly espouse
ns monetary reform and American in
ow dependence are to be coerced, their
notes lprotested, their credits re
Sfused, andt be in every way molest
ca ed by the money power. The gold
uta- hug dailies are to offer their week
ar- ly blanket sheets of lies and mis
representations for less than the
cosot of the paper upon which they
md are printed. Money will be spent
eat like water, because the usuers ot
uWall and Lombard streets who
! yearly rob the people of ever $500,
S0J0,000, can easily afford to spend
sti- *100,000,000 to secure a continua
ur tiou of the system which enriches
low them aund impoverishes the people.

, not he regardcd as a true friend to w
I the silver movement, if he falis to yo
decline.
a In the Chica-go convention the
r heart of the people was dominant
t when the Democrats nominated
Bryan. The convention was drunk
with enthusiasm or something else
when it presented Sewall for sec
V ond place.
At St. Louis the heart of the
people dominated' the entire con
vention in its selection of a Presi
dential ticket.
Bryan and Watson both sprang
a from the hearts of the Ixeople, and,
º. together they will electrify the
nation with their oratorical fervor,
i and we hazard nothing when we
say, that Nebraska will have no ad
g vantage over Georgia in forensic
d display.
Mf r. Sewall must decline. The
success of silver demands it. The
; impoverishment of the people cry
n out aloud for it. Watson is in
e sympathy with every demand made
"r at Chicago. Sewall is not. Let us
L" play honest with the people. The
g idea of nominating a national bank
re president on a platform that repu
re diates the national banking system,
a is inconsistent with every require
it ment of common honesty.
Watson is in accord with every
r- principle of the Chicago platform.
n tiHe says so, andl he means what he
le says, for he is a patriot, who breath
es with the respiration of the
so toiling masses.
11- In Nebraska, there are more
li- Populists than DeI)mocrats-- less of
1, either than Republicans. The same
` condition exists in Kansas and oth
n er Western states. Mr. Bryan
knowns that he has no chance of
ir carrying any Western state with
be out Populist aid. Every sane
uman knows that, without fusion,
of Democracy and silver is doomed to
1n everlasting defeat in Tennessee and
North Carolina.
n- Why not combine ? Why not
h. make our wish good by bringing
mn the Populists back into the Demo
of cratic party? This can only be
done on the basis of fairness. It
ad will not do for the Democrats to
)t- eat apple dumpling, while we give
to crow pie to the Populists. The
or Commercial does not favor such
oe courtesy. It believes in that whole
in- souled Southern and Western hos
air pitality, which rocognizes that there
re- is nothing too good for the invited
It- guest.
Id- We wouldn't give Tom Watson
ºk- for the whole state of Maine- for
is- there is no more chance of elect
he ing a Democratic candklate in
ey Maine, than there is for the I)em
ut ocracy of the Union taking wings
oo and flying in a solid body to heav
en.
d Give us Bryan and Watson.
ni That makes the issue square, and
will save the peoplo from financial

6 Death is a sad thing at all times

ple in this case it seemed more so than

y- not so.
The Lord hath said, "suffer lit
