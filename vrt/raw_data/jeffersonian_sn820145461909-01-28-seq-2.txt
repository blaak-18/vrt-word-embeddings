WHEN THE SONG IS DONE.
By Arthur Upson.
When the song is done
And his heart is ashes,
Never praise the Singer
Whom you, silent, heard.
What to him the sound?
What your eyes’ fond flashes?
When the singing’s over
Say no word!
Ye who darkling stood,
Think, your noon of praises,
'Can it glimmer down
To his deepest bower?
Never round him shone
Once your garden-mazes:
Now his wandering’s over
Bring no flower!
—The Bellman.
THE SOUTH NEEDS RELIEF.
If the Republican party wants
scatter prosperity in the South
should squelch the cotton
gamblers o£ Wall street.
That gang robs the South of
millions of dollars every
year, and Congress should
suppress it. The farmer of
the South puts his whole
trust in his cotton crop, be
cause it has always been the
only thing that could be
raised to a large extent in
the South, that would bring
ready cash at all times.
It is true that nearly any
thing can be grown in the
South, and it is also true that
our people are taking to di
versified farming more and
more each year, but the fact
still remains that the cotton
crop will always be the main
source of the South’s reve
nue, and it needs protection
from the gamblers, many of
whom never saw a cotton
field.
The cotton crop is a hard
one to raise, and it should
never bring less than ten
cents, for it costs just about
that much to produce it, and when
the farmer fails to get that much for
it, he is losing money on his invest
ment.
We have been gratified to note that
Congressman Heflin, of the fifth con
gressional district, in this State, has
been endeavoring to have Congress
take some action in the matter, and
we trust he will succeed in giving the
farmer of the South the relief he has
so long needed. He has suffered
enough from a financial standpoint,
and he deserves protection. -Opelika
Post.
WHAT HE GOT OUT OF IT.
We live in an age when no matter
what one does somebody wants to
know What he is getting out of it. It
is true that never before has there
been so much graft, so many cases of
breach of trust, so much stealing from
the public till. Yet there are still
those remaining who do things
through love of humanity.
Patriotism is not entirely dead.
Many noble men and women are giv-
ing of their time and talent in order
to better conditions, and are getting
nothing out of it.
In most cases they get abuse and
ridicule; they injure their business
> interest; invite malicious invective
and eternal hatred; too often meet
with most violent opposition from
those for whom they labor. If they
are strong, they override the storms
of opposition. If they are weak, they
are carried down beneath the rushing
waves. Many sordid and selfish peo
ple cannot conceive how any man or
woman can unselfishly labor for the
mere sake of humanity and get noth
ing out of it. To such
there is no use to deny that you get
something out of it. They are so
steeped in sordidness and selfishness
themselves that they will meet your
denial with the sneer of the miserable
bigot. There are others, really intel
ligent, who carelessly make state
ments to the effect that somebody has
to sold out, is getting something out of
it it. This is all wrong. It is often

cruelly unjust. No one should ever
make a statement that they do not
have the proof to substantiate. No
really broad man will do so. To tra
duce the name of others, either ma- (
liciously or carelessly, rebounds on (
you. ' - .
When you make the statement that
somebody has sold out, is getting (
something out of it, you unconsciously
betray yourself, and your hearers
know that if you were similarly situ
ated you would be dead certain to
sell out, or get something out of it. —
Royston Record.
THE INEQUALITIES OF THE LAW
We are frequently so blinded by the
colossal magnitude of great achieve
ments that we entirely overlook the
principle involved; and the man who
commits some petty act of theft is
promptly branded a felon, while the
man who, by clever manipulation, dis
honestly turns a million is called a
financier of the Napoleonic school.
Not long ago a culprit, in Oakland,
Cal., who stole only eight cents was
Jeffersonian
to the penitentiary for
eight years.
What the circumstances were the
dispatches failed to indicate. The
man may have deserved the limit.
But the action of the court acquires
special significance by virtue of the
fact that it sets an object lesson to
the mills of justice on the other side
of the bay of San Francisco.
This statement is not intended to
reflect upon individuals. Guilt should
never go unwhipped of justice, how
ever trifling or great; and innocence
should never be made to pay the pen
alty for wrongdoing. But how true to
human experience is the familiar
quatrain:
“The law condemns the man or wo
man
Who steals the goose from off the
common;
But lets the greater felon loose
Who steals the common from the
goose. ’ ’

FARM COMMISSION.
President Roosevelt has appointed
a commission to ascertain the cause of
the discontent of the farmers, to
1 ‘up-lift” the farmers. Mr. Roose
velt and his commission will never and
can never uplift the farmers, until the
octopus that takes three-fifths of not
only what the farmers produce, but
three-fifths of what all labor produces,
is removed from our financial system.
Through this system the wealth pro
ducer’s are paying interest on a debt
that has been paid in full. If it is
wrong to compel one man to pay in
terest on a debt after he has paid it in
full, is it not a greater wrong to com
pel eighty millions of people to do it,
in order to have money, which they
are obliged to have, or cease to be a
civilized nation? —Vineland Inde

JUST FOR FUN.
That interesting magazine article
upon “Whai Americans Owe the Chi

little marks on the tag which comes
from the laundry.
Even the plebeian goober joins the
hungry chorus for more tariff.
Why not set the secret service men

It is getting so that one can never
tell whether or not a person has
insanity in his family until he mur

Another case of Roosevelt luck.
This growling of the congressmen is
splendid practice for real jungle
work.
The weather bureau said, “There

Senator Culberson rises in
his place to say that the

Whose law?

It may be true that a St.

he is just stringing us.
Also, the Hon. Boies Pen

The expulsion of E. H.

The announcement that Seth Low

put under the head of brainstorm.
It is to be hoped that congress will
make Mr. Taft’s salary SIOO,OOO a

the most grasping persons you ever
saw.
An attorney in the Hains case asked
