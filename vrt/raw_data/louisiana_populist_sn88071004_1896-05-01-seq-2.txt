NATCHITOCHEn FOR
PHARR.
Even by the unfair count of the
Democrats, backed by 5( armed
men from DeSoto, and 156 of the
State militia, with Gatling gun.
58 is the majority allowed by the
Returning Board.
One Populist Representative,
I)r. J. M. Brown, secured 42 ma
jority in spite of the Democratic
count. While J. H. Caldwell,
Democrat, pulled through by 4
votes over Tetts on a Democratic
counat. Freeman gets 65 majority
over Jones, and ilyams 133 over
Hathorn by this count.
But old ward 3 with a Populist
majority of 191 was thrown out
against the protest of the Popu
lists, and that of many right think
ing Democrats.
While ward 6 with its stuffed
majority, manipulated by drun
ken rowdies, was counted over the
same protest.
After demoanstrating in no un
certain way their ability to use
force as a last resort, the Populists
have appealed to the courts and
the legislature for justice in a
righteous cause, and we have no
doubt but that they will secure
every oice in the perii.

The La:tement. /
The attnempt and fin:l cnsun:na
tion of the only plan tl::ht would
land a single D1.emocrat in any of
our parish offices was to throw
out the peaceable quiet election
held in ward 3 and count in the
drunken, fraudulent votes of ward
6, very naturally raised the ire of
every liberty loving citizen in old I
Natchitoches, whether Populist or
I)emocrat.
Thte Populists, however, c inft
(ldent in the ability of Natchitoches
to settle their own affairs, and bold
in the righteousness of their cause,
sent never a telegram or minessen
rer fcr outside help. While the
poor frightened Democrats, con
science smitten by the wrong they
were inflicting, sent every where
for guns, amunition, men and
m:litia, as the following will show:

56 armed men were induced to

four-fifths of the white parishes

and that the white section of Lou

Counting even Orleans, the Pop
ulists and Republicans carry the
white parishes of Louisiana by a
majority of 4632.
The Times then goes on to show
that Foster's artificial majority is CO:
taken entirely from the heavy black
parishes, as follows :

- the Democracy depends for suc- fr
r cess upon thos parishes and these no

The white people must and 'shall

Democracy must appeal if it wish
es to continue in favor. wi
We agree most heartily with of
the Times-Democrat that the white
people must rule Louisiana, and t
that means Pharr for Governor. ,

too foul to print.
This rising young generation,
with no conception of the duties
of a citizen and indifferent to the
appalling conditions confronting
the great interests of a great State,
will, in a short time, assume con
trol of our public aflairs. The
lessons they have learned of Dem
ocracy; trained as common elec
tion swindlers; wilfully ignorant
of the demands of the hour, fit
them as promoters of a system of
political debauchery which will be,
nay, has become, a stench to the
nostrils of honest men, at home
and abroad.
Truly, Louisiana is in a fearful
situation. A political combination
hased on the division of the spoils
of office and upon a platform kick
ed to the winds as soon as adopted,
is seeking to perpetuate its power,
the further exercise of which eve
ty thoughtful man dreads. Even
ooeservative mn, bound by tradi
