TO LITTLE TAT.
Dream, gentlo darling, tliy sweetest
dream ;
The woes of earth are yet not thine,
And life, like a fleeting twilight beam,
Is but a shadow in the scalo ot time.
Ali ! like the bud of beauty and brightest
bloom,
Those glowing cheeks soon must fade ;
t'en now I can rend thy early doom—
The cold hand of Death is ou theu laid.
There is a change iu that little eye—
Thy brow bespeaks the increasing pain,
The 'fleeting breath foretells thy cud is
uigh,
Thon wilt not with us long remain.
A mother's joy—her hopes and pride,
Built in fancy's brightest lines ou theo ;
But alas! like the ebb of the tide,
Tbou art drawn away from me.
Thy eyes are closed, thy breath is stilled,
I1Ï gaze no more ; thy soul lias fled,
And though tjjfa cup of grief is filled,
I'll lot no tear for theo be shed.
The strife of earth thon did'st not know—
Thy soul by sin bears no stain.
' Thou art free front tempters here below,
And can'st now dwell iu God's domain.
And snre there arc flowery fields
And glittering ntreaius more puro
Than mortal's most vivid dreams
E'er pictured in that land of yore.
Bright visions there you'll see—
A world of joy that knows 110 euro.
Where suffering mortals long to lie,
The borne the good alone can share.
A FATHER.
Agricultural.
The rain still continuous, ami lit
tle labor has been performed by the
planters, for the last week. The
seasonsarediscouraging, but let our
farmers not despair. The incessant
rains have prevented the proper
preparation ot lands and the plant- j
iug of corn, cotton and other crops
has been delayed. It is perhaps j
better that corn was not planted so
early, as in many cases the seed
has been lost in the ground. In
conversation with sojne of our best
informed and successful farmers, we
learn that the early corn, although ;
up and a gocd stand, will be a fail
ure and should be ploughed up and j
planted over- No one from the al- 1
most incessant wet weather has
been able to give the requisite cul
tivation, and the stalk is from six
to eight inches in height aud turn
ing yellow.
A planter of long experience and
a close observer says, ''that the
roots ot the early corn arc turning
black and rotteuing; that such corn
may regain its color, grow and tas
sei with pi* per cultivation, but
will not produce any grain. lie
says that in 3871 the early spring,
very similar to this in constant
rains, that the corn regained its
color after tho rains ceased,' it was I
cultivated, grew, was a small stalk, !
tasselled at the regular time, but
A ,,
..
on many stalks there were 110
shoots at all, while 011 others, that
liad the appearance of a good and
full ear, when examined there was
no grain. The only com that he
made that year was planted be
tween the 10th and 20th o f May,
which was a good stand iu eight
days."
The plant deseased as it is now—
will not recover and the only safety
is planting over. We advise all off
our planters to be sure that they
bave a crop of corn secure, before j
ever planting a seed of cotton. The |
causes of so many disasters andgreat
losses to planters and merchants,
alike, is the failure in tho grain
crop, and too great a desire to make,
cotton.

"93" BY VICTOR nUGO — IIIS LAST
work.
The writings of the author of Les
Miserables; The Toilers of the
Sea ; and the Man who Laughs, al
ways command attention from the
reading public and find a réady
sale among the lovers of first class
literature. The style of Victor II u
go is exceedingly queer, if the
translations of the French do him
justice, and his characters general
ly formed after a pattern of his
own, that strikes us as being rather
over wrought, and wanting in that
union of nature with fiction, where
in consists the true perfection of
novel writing.
j source we have
tiie gilded age,
j by Mark Twain and J. Dudley
His incidents are iather unnatu
ral and strike'us as being the ro
sult of an effort on his part to be
singular. For instance, in " 93 "
the whole of the chapters devoted
to a description of the antics of «
cannon that broke its fastenings on
board the ship at sea, is too dra
matical in all its details; and the
battle of the single disabled ship
against the whole opposing lleet is
too unnatural to appear well. Ta
ken altogether, however, we like
ll 93" better than cither The Toilers
of the Sea, or The Man Who
Laughs, and would place it next to
Les Miserables. From the saute
Warner.

in "ltoughing It" was so great that

G. W. S. —Tho legislature so-called
has made t sp many changes in the laws
and lias so fixed up things to suit their
peculiar ideas, that wo really can not
tell whether or not a child whose par
ents lives in one parish is entitled to
go to the public schools iu another
parish. Our opinion is; that it was
originally intended that tho school
children of each pariah should attend
the schools of that parish. Tho reason
of Jrbia is apparent from Iho tact that
each parish draws its pro rata of the
the school fund in accoidance with the
number of school children in that par
isli, as ascertained iyy Iho census; ami
that if ehiltlrcu were permitted to go
from tho schools of one parish
another, it would be nn easy matter to!
require some one parish to support and
provide teachers fora much larger
