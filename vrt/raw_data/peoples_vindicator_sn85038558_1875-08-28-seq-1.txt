lish, labor in Lorisiani as compared with
the colored.
lte . For many years it was supposed
nn, that it was impossible for white
taty men to successfully cultivate cotton
upon the alluvials of the South--sp
Icial posed we say; but there are few who
101 know that this supposition was the'
,nit, political trick of the slave holder in
655. the first instance, and after the war,
was was the electioneering cry of the car
rer, pet-bag leaders South.
see It is easy to understand why thisl
should have been so in both instances.
all The desire to "make money" and
but "make it all" was the prime motive
a in actuating both parties. " More land.; 4
the more slaves; no room for white I
It it labor, was the cry of those slave own
t ers who had seen the test of it in the
by border States and in Arkansas and i
at Texas. No whites need come, cries
the the carpet bagger; the climate is I
1oY deadly; you cannot stand the heat; '
and what disease don't kill, the
ate bloody White Leaguer stands ready
en- to destroy. These follies follow each
Sother naturally and are but the re
the suit of self interest. C
21, Now that all these things are be- .
i ing exploded, and men are. becoming t
le reasonable, the fact is being demon- ii
0,. strated, that while labor is not only a
ite able to stand our climate, but is far Ii
115 superior in the intelligent application o
e of his physical capacity to the negro. t
of That fact has been demonstrated in tri
ng this parish and cannot be contradict- I
ed.
am t
to- Whites have come in all along the w
le- river since 1874. From the Lane to I
the Grant plantations, being the up- ti
)e per and lower places on the river el
mar line, and in every instance the white o
Sman's crop is far superior to the ne
gro-that s1, he will make and gather
e more to each hand than the colored.
What is more he has produced his
ck crop at less .labor than the negro. tl
Why t Simply because he worked at H
the proper time, and when the negro a
Is- was plowing in the heat of Summer
ýt* the white man had "laid by" his crop, a
was dozing in the shade, waiting for P
ad harvest time. This is not idle talk, but ki
ean be proven to be as we say by so- a
of teal examples in a hundred localities. h
Another false statement is made to h
deter white immigration by "interest 1
ed men"; that is, the bad health of m
the valleys. Who are the healthy ot
I people here t Where is the least P1
e- sickness in this parish ? We answer, de
in "o the river banks," Our water is tel
in from the heavens ; pure rain water; ad
. no mineral springs or bad wells ; but P1
the best known to man, the distilled le
a dew from heaven. a
SThis too hlas been exploded; and we
Sare glad to see so many white men
it crowding to the rich soil where their a
- toil will be rewarded ten fold& The
same may be said to be the case in
all parts of the State, and we note HI
, the fact that thie finest sugar; crops in di
South Louisiana are those that have tW
been cultivated exclusively by white t
labor. A
We predict that in less than ten or
years from this, Louisiana, the "Eden th
of America," will have a population w
of white fivOe times as great as now.
o This will not only add to our wealth';
Sput Us well up in the race for Im- tl

g tical question beyond all doubt. fro
