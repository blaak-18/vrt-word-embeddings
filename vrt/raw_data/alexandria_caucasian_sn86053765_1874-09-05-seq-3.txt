Hoping there will he no federal interfer

determined to make a resolute cft'-irt to as
sist in hurling thieve* from office and pnl

believe with Stephen A. llooiiuhiH, that
"tlii* government wa* made hy while men.
for the benefit of white men and their pos
terity forever, and m I ioIi UI lie administered
by white men anil by none other what
soever." We are in favor of the selection
of white men for office.
We have in time* past done all in onr

WedenonncetlielT.fi Marshal at New j

federal power in using it on all occasions
to support the imnrpei* and e*peeia ;i v in

through the country a* a federal posse
when thev dined nut. do so except under
ledcral protection.
We will not support any one for office
who doe* not approve of the objects of
thi* organization.
We appreciate the action of Ihn Presi
dent for hi* neutral course in the recent
Southern election*.
We regard the organization and aiming
of the Kellogg mil. lia under protection of
Fwlcral troops in the Parish a\ a direct
threat against the liberties of the pcoolc,
jet we hold them in contempt and derision
We have waited in vain for a remedy
from Congres* to rid us of the Kellogg
usurpation, but still denounce it as the
most infamous fraud ever perpetrnted
against any people professing to he frei*
and we pledge onrnelves to do all
power to effect it* overthrow.
We recommend a Mass Meeting «.f Hie
white people of the parish he h"M at
Black Springs, near Harrisonburg, on t , ( .

of an organization of a parish Wli te
League.
On motion the meeting adjourned to
meet, at the Pine Hills church, on Sicilv

Editors Catted*ion:
Gentlemen —1 would not in
fringe upon the «pace of your p:iper
were it not for the fact that I desire
some definite in format ion ujmhi ;i
question of HeriotiH importance to
the voters of the State, in connec
tion with the proceedings of the
IJatoii Kotige convention.
I hail judged that th.» question of
party :ian>v, wliicli was within the
s|K*cial province of that convention
to determine, and which was truly
the only business of importance
they cnuld lie called upon to per
form, had been definitely and dis
tinctly settled by the adoption of
the following preamble, to wit:
"We the u liile people of Louisia
na, ciulii'iiring the Democratic par
ty. 'the Conservative party, the
Whir«*, Man's Party, the Liberal
party, the Urform party and all
ot Iters op|M)sed to the Kellogg usur
piiti >n, do solemnly resolve and de
clare—
1st. That the government uow
existing in I^ouisiatia," etc., etc.
I have seen a manuscript copy of
the above preamble together with
the resolutions passed by the coil
veutioii, taken from the original
handed in by the committee of
Twenty-one, and also the published
proceedings us contained in the Ita
ton lfonge Advocate, issued on the
evening of the adjournment of the
Convention, the Editor ot which
paper was one of the delegates to
the convention, and 1 find the
above language contained, word for
word, in the preamble as reported
by them. The daily Advocate was
issued on Tuesday evening before
the convention adjourned but after
the preamble anil resolutions had
been reported by the committee
of Twenty one, and adopted by the
convention, and I cannot see how
the Editor of that piper, who cer
tainly got his copy from the Com
mittee of Twenty one, cou M have
committed an error in publishing
the proceedings of the convention.
the proceedings of the convention.
I had expected to find in the last
issue of the Louisiana Democrat,
the proceedings published in full
since all the press throughout the
State, friendly to the purposes and
aims of the late convention have
given the proceedings to their read
ers as matter of the highest interest.
Iii the Democrat , however, 1 find
the resolutions ot the convention
published, together wilh what pur
ports to lie a preamble, in which it
is distinctly declared that 4 *\ve the
white people of Louisiana, embrac
ing"' etc., etc., '-do solemnly resolve
. ,
declare icc name it the J. ocplc H
-party. 1 his seems to Ije OIIC Ot the
versions of the preamble. Where
; djd the Democrat get its report ?
. _ . . 11
i ^ the on 1\ newspaper I ha\e seen
\ silice tllC adjournment of the CI,n
lr'j vention, that, states the above to be
u ,, n . alI1 ble of tilO resolution?
1 , , ...
j adopted by the Com eilt loll. A liai
, tide ill the Satlie issue of the JjOlli.S
jnii;l Democrat, taken from (lie N.
0 pj,. avnIlf contains a correction
, • '
,| le Democrat
by that.paper of its published pro
cecdings of the convention in a
former issue, wherein it was stated
that the convention did adopt the
name "People's Party" iu the pre
amble. The Picayune says it erred
in making that statement. That it.
was led into the error hy reason of
the lateness ot the hour of receiv
ing its Katoii Uoitge dispatches,
their crude punctuation etc., and
• lie consequent hurry in copying
them for the compositor. The Pic
ayuue now publishes the preamble
as stated iu all the other papers I
have sei-ii except the Democrat. I
cannot conceive any reason for
I the Democrat announcing the pre
amble contained in its last issue,
as the one adopted by the conv»li
tioti # af liiiton Rouge, unless it is
tli.it the editor of that paper has
been misled in some way. Ile
should, by this time, be fully aware
ot the doings of the convention.—
At all events, I cannot attribute to
any intention or de
sire to confuse the minds of its
readers on the subject of the party
name or to mislead the uninformed
iu reference to so important a ques
tion. The convention did not say
in their preamble we, etc., etc., "sol
emnly resolve aud declare, tee name
it the People's Party? However the
Louisiana Democrat, as a simple
newspaper, is private property and
Ithe proprietor has the right to pub
i - i i » i i • -7 i .
lish what he pleases in it, but as a
. . , . 4
party journal it ought to adopt some
i . * • , «
I'*" ^ Pf'UCipIçS aild
"ta lid lip to the scratch COIlsisteUt
' ly ami manfully, as i know the edi
tor of that paper can do if he choos
es. To say that the preamble
adopted by the convention does
''name it the people's party," is a
down right error too serious to be
liRl.tl.v- hulals..,!, in times like
these, and entirely too palpable to
mislead any but stupio people.—
The editor of the Democrat has uo
doubt stumbled into this incomis
tency in the hurry of wielding the—
scissors We want harmony and
j a, 'd the old and experienced
:citizcuswbo have the prosperity of
ibcir Sr«tcnt lio:irt, r,-ill a.1(11<* thtn
harmony instead ot offering any
embarrassments, however uninten
tional, calculated to mislead the
people as to what their convention
did at Baton Rouge.
Respectfully,
DEMOCRAT.

The death of Mr. Zimmerman
which was sudden and micxpected.
brought sorrow to the -hearts of his

loss will be felt not only by his

The Directors of the Association in consequence of the impoverished condition of
our people and the general stringency of the times, lind themselves nnalile to obtain
from the ordinary method* of raising filiiils— means sufficient and necessary to place
this institution upon a solid and permanent basis—one that will «-nable tlient to
increase its sphere of usefulness and attractiveness to ull classes of the public.
To accomplish the following desirable ends: 1st. The extinguishment of all debts
which may now I n ; due bv llie Association. 2nd. The erection of suitable buildings
for the Mechanical aud Agricultiiaal products exhibited, and for the protection of
stock—tho Directors have adopted the foregoing plan, which seems to them thetnily
feasible and practical way of raising the neccssary funds. In proposing this scheme tho
Directors do not disguise from themselves the difficulties which must attend it*
execution ; but reposing their confidence in the worthiness of their aims, they np

ishes, and to every pnblic spirited Loiiisiauiau. to come forward and aid an enter
prise, which so ks only to build up and develop the resources of our beloved State.
The object of the Association is to create a renewed interest among all classes of
our citizens in our coming Fair, and at the same time, by ottering large iuducmciits,
to stimulate the sale of its tickets to au extent that w ill enable it to realize an
amount adequate to its pressing wants. The plan of The Association is to issue 20.
000 tickets at seventy-five cents a ticket—the price of admission to the Fair, with »
coupon attached liearing a number: the said ticket entitling the bolder to one ad
mission to the Fair, the con|Htu being retained by himself.
