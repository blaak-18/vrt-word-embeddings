OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
WASIINGTOs D. C., April 30, 1878.
The defence that Senator Conkling
makes when the recently published
"interview" is brought to his notice,
is not an original one. and not even
in the line of originality. "I did not
say it," says the Senator, "and when
I said it the man took no notes, and1
the conversation was a private one."
But the internal evidence of thlie re
port itself is too convincing. lh)nial,
even less equivocal than the Stenatirs,
would not change the public hIlicf.
The reporter may have addled a line
or two here and there, but the sub
stance is Conkling's. le called Mr.
Hayes "that man hlMayes." lie claim
ed the invention of the Electoral
Commission. lie said that itat;ley
Matthews was a pretty good man,
but weak. lie said there was a bar
gain between Gov. Nicholls and
Hayes, and that Stanley Matthews
and Sherman were privy to it. and
that when the whole truth about Lou
isiana affairs was known it would
sink the administration "to the lonw
est depths of infamy." HIe said the
Administration's civil service reform
was a humbug, which it is. He said
that Burnside was a ninny, and that
Hoar and Christiancy sold themselves
to Hayes for patronage, and that
Conover was kept up to the support
of the Administiation by fear of a
criminal persecntion. All these things,
no doubt, he -said. lHis denial, if lie
should make one, wonhl of course
satisfy the Senators to whom ont;t
tering allusions were llade, hlilt t he
public will still believe that what
is given as coming from Conkiilg
came from hiini.
The effect of the '"eport pon C('ok
ling's prospects of sunceeding ini
self as Senator froml New Y olk niii it
be great. If he boldly nli nlollln te
that the ideas and opinions of the
reported interview, omiting what is
purely personal, are his, and pro
ceeds to enforce them by speech aw':
act, thus compelling a rnptitii of the
party with the Ad ,iniiistation, hi,
will becomie of necessity the leader
of the palty. If lie piusues the policy
of silence in the pthIlic councils anil
in the caucuses of the pll ty, hit let
his tongue run in scandahls riot in
his intercom se with iildividtl als, it
needs no prolhet to forelell, not only
his downfall as a national lender, lint
his loss of influence and power in his
own State. It is common talk, by
the way, that Mr. HaIi-es will appoint
ex-Senator Fenton, Collector of Cus
tonms in New York. Just how this
would advance the cause of civil ser
vice reform no one can explain, hut
that it would seriously threaten the
ascendancy of Conkling in the Re
publican politics of New York is un
questionable, as it would put the
enormous Federal patronage of the
Custom House in the hands of Conk
ling's enemies. That they would use
it against him mercilessly and un
scrupulously, and would he encoii
aged in so doing by the Administra
tion does not admit of doubt.
It is gratifying that the earlier
statesmen and hetoes of the country
are receiving attention now and then.
It was a good idea to set apart a por
tion of the Capital fi)r a Hall of Stat
nary, in which each State might place
statues of her illustrious sons. A
resolution was passed the other day
which will enable the Washington
Monument Association to go on with
the work bpon that great commemo
rative shaft. The house only last
week voted money for the purpose of
erecting a monument to Jeflersotr,.
Yesterday in the Senate Mr. Beck
presented resolutions of the Ken
tacky Legislature in reference to a
monument to General Zachary Tay
lor. The ideas associated with all
these men are patriotic, and such as
the Americans of the future may safe
ly cherish.
ALBION.
Senator Gordon.
To the Editor of the Detroit Free Press.
Ex-Gov Smith, of Virginia, better
known as "Extra Billy"tells the fol
lowing excellent story on this distin
gnished Georgian. The Governor
says that some time during thie late
struggle a negro hastier or servant at
tached to his headquarters came lhur
riedly into his tent early one morn
ing and to his infinite astonishment
thus addressed him :
"Marse William, I heare dat Marse
Gordon is gwine to charge de enemy
this morning, and if you haven't any
ting'tinular for me to do, I wants to
go 'long wid.him."
"You want to go with Gen Gordon
in a charge on the enemy; well pray,
what is that for q"
"Wall, you see Marse William, we
boys 'bout de stables is pretty well
out of oil skins and blankets, and I'se '
always observed dat wlien Marse
Gordon charges dese Yankees dey gits
away in sich a hurry dut dey nmost iii C
general lebes all dem kind ob 'tlngs
behind dem."
The request, ofcourse, was gmranted,
and some hours after tile darke r
came back loaded with the coveted C
supplies.

Mark Twain as a Reporter. ce
Mark Twain was once a reporter oni
the San Francisco Call. One dlay the
city editor detailed him to report
a riot among the stevedores along tlie t
water front, with orders to get the "
facts and make a column â€¢ "Yaas,"
said Twain, "but how can I get them ?
There's no street railroad down that
way. You wouldn't want a fellow to
walk a mile to see a couple of long
ahoremen fight would you !" One
day, after Twain had been on the pa
per six months, the managing editor
remarked to himl that hlie was out of
his line as a reporter, and was enpa e
ble of better things, and that in fac, t
he didn't suit. "Yeas," said T'ain, "
"I'm surprised you didn't find that
oat ive months ago." i

'lThe riiction of Joihn sherl'nlil that

a dhlnsion that the hianks can lint fail

How to Observe Sunday.
The question of the proper observ
ance of Sunday has been a mnch dis
pited one, aidl is one of muich inter
'est. A cewrtai, aiuint of religious
se vices, should of course form a part
of eaml Sunday's lifti ; shol utl indeed
hie its central idea, but it should not
infringe upon the deinands of over
worked nature fwr rest. But what is
rest f Clearly what would be rest to
wne would not be to another. What
wounld increase vitality and strength
to the day laborer w ould make the
weary student, hook. keeper or editor
more weary. The work of the six
weeks days. whatever it is, shionhid be
tu etietly ou it ,i siglht from Satiur.
day until Monday. Mental labor-
reading, writing or other employment
that requires mental effort. Physical
laborers must cease physical labor,
and caIl obitain thle desired rest in
mental imnprovenmient. Tliose whose c
week days alte spent within the four
walls of a store or an otffice, should be
in the open air, in the broad fields,
whe.ie they can bireathe nature's pu
rest aetilal draughts, as lmuch as pos
sible. Those who labor out of dwors
will find their grelatest rest and enjoy.
ieit oin Sunday in theirihomes. The
usiniess nian andli the banker shiould
cease all thoughit of business, take a
complete reswite froini all tliongtli of
"sheoll," anid SUtilay for all claisses
shiould be made as widely different
from others days in the week as pos
sible. It shoulild be moade enjoyable,
especially o)r the ellildren, that, they
may grow up with the love of the day
instead of an aversion for it, as is too
commonti even in the best (if Christian
families. The observance of the day
in eachl hotusehold should be made a
study, that the ost profitable aud
rest giving etnjoymlent to suit 'each sc
cease may be found, and then let p1
die observance of the day, once set
tied, be lived up to as strictly as a *
business tranlsaction. Tlhle day should
hauve its distlinctive features, religious
culture; freiedomn from toil of for ser
'ant as well as master; rest in its true
senise, and enjoiyment of the highest
rider, which relazes the nervous sys
tenm, and is one wf nature's greatest
restoratives, all have their place, an d
none of them should be neglected.

Nobody who is afraid of laughing,
and heartily too, at his friend, can be el
said to have a true and thorough love
for him; and on the other hand it
would betray a sorry want of faith, to
distrust a friend because he laughs at
you. Few men, I believe, are much fo
worth loving. in whom there is not (0
aomething well worth laughing at.
