OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THIS PARISH,
Catered at the Lafayette La. Post-Office as Second
Class Matter.
SATURDAY, JULY 3, 1897".
EQUA4L JUSTICE.
Louis Gallot is thd fourth bank
wrecker who has been convicted in
New Orleans during the past three
months. No more can it be truth
fully said that the juries of the
Crescent City will not return ver
dicts of guilty against men who
possess money and friends. The
four men who are now in the parish
prison at New Orleans awaiting
sentence were, up to the time of
their indictment, prominent in the
financial, political and social affairs
of that city. To-day they occupy
felons' cells.
Let us hope that the sad fate of
these men, once held in high es
teem by their fellows, will serve as
an example and will deter others
from entering upon a career of
crime which may result in a mo
ment of spurious prosperity, but is
sure to bring down upon them mer
ited disgrace.
The conviction of these bank
looters can not fail to have a most
wholesome effect among that class
of rich men who had gotten it into
their minds that because of their
wealth or influence they would not
be prosecuted and made to pay the
penalty of the law.
Let the good work go on. Let it
be proclaimed throughout the land
that the bank wrecker is not better
than the hog thief.
The jails and penitentiaries should
not be the exclusive home of the
friendless and penniless. Within
their gloomy walls should also
dwell the wealthy law-breaker.
LIVING TOO FA4ST.
The New Orleans States makes
these timely remarks on the evils of
the credit system:
"There is no sort of question but
the mass of the people of this
country have been living too fast.
Nothing is so difficult as for a man
who has been accustomed to the
elegancies of life to bring himself
down to its bare necessities, even
when sound judgment teaches that
there is nothing else left for him to
do. Want of credit, it is true, is a
great hardship, but will not a facil
ity of credit bring greater disaster
in the end? It prompts expendi
tures beyond one's means, often
times the purchase of articles that
might will be dispensed with.
These are very trite facts which
everyone recognizes, but is rarely
influenced by The National Associ
ation of Credit Men, recently in
session at Kansas City, proposed to
bring them forcibly to the mind of
the man of moderate means by ad
vocating an enforcement of the
system of cash payments."
The Times-Democrat is doing
noble work in leading the move
ment to provide mosquito bars for
persons confined in the jails of New
Orleans. The T.-D. is always in
the front when there is any work of
genuine charity to be done.
One hundred and nine nails were
taken out of the stomach of a Kan
sas City man. Had he succeeded
to digest all or it, it would be safe
to say that he is a man with an iron
constitution.
It is said that after shaking
hands with several thousand ne
groes at Asheville, N. C., the
other day, President McKinley im
plored his friends to give him a
little bit of fresh air.
We note that in se'eral parishes
the question of a railroad tax is
being submitted to the voters. The
Gazette is unalterably opposed to
voting taxes for the benefit of rail
road corporations. Let railroad
builders take their chances as other
people. The railroad companies
and other corporations are already
enjoying more privileges than they
are entitled to. It is not the peo
ple who should be taxed for the
railroads, but it is the railroads
tha)t'should be made to pay more
taxes.
A GREAT SPEECH.
Jddge John H. Reagan, of Texas,
ex-member of President Davis' cab*
inet, delivered the annual oration at
the N.ashville reunion. Following
are the closing paragraphs of the
great effort:
{"And now that we are again citi
zens of the government of the
United States, living under the
same government and constitutional
flag, our late adversaries ought not
to desire to degrade us i'n the eyes
of posterity, and if they would be
wise and just they should not wish
to place our people in history in the
position of being unworthy of the
rights, liberty and character of citi
zens of our great and common
country.
" And while I have accepted,
and do accept, in good faith, the
legitimate results of the war, and
while I ani, and will be, as true to
my allegiance and duty to our com
mon government as any other citi
zen can be, I shall insist on my
right to tell the truths which show
that in that great struggle we were
guided and controlled by a spirit of
patriotism which caused us to stake
life, liberty and property in a con
test with a greatly superior power,
rather than basely surrender our
rights without a struggle.
"It is fitting and proper at this
point that I should refer to a matter
which fitly illustrates the character
of the southern people. There was
never a time during all the perils
and suffering of reconstruction that
men of prominence who had been
on the Confederate side could not
have obtained positions of honor
and emolument under the federal
government if they would have
consented to surrender their con
victions and betray their people.
A very few did so and thereby
earned an everlasting infamy. But
nearly all of them stood by their
convictions and preserved their
honor, and thereby proved them
selves worthy of citizenship in the
greatest and proudest government
on earth.
"The names of Jefferson Davis,
R. E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Al
bert Sydney Johnston and many
others of our heroic leaders will go
into history, illuminated by a halo
of courage and skilii and purity of
life and patriotism unsurpassed by
any names in history. As indica
ting the faith of President Davis in
God and his devout earnestness, I
recall attention to the closing sen
tence of his inaugural address, af
ter his election under the constitu
tional government of the Confed
eracy, made on the 22d day of
February, 1862. Raising his hands
at the close of his address, and
looking towards the heavens, he
said: "And now, O God, I commit
my country and her cause into thy
holy keeping," thus showing the
solemnity with which he assumed
anew the duties of president of the
Confederacy.
"'History notes with its richest
praises, the matrons of Rome.
They were no doubt worthy of all
that has been said of them. But
their honors cluster about them
when Rome was a great and victo
rious nation. This is not said to
their discredit, but to contrast with
them the noble and devoted women
of the Confederacy. The grandeur
of their lives and conduct was ex
hibited in a cause in which the
odds were greatly against their
country, in which sacrifices were
necessary, and in which success
was at all times doubtful.
<,To illustrate the character and
devotion of the women of the Con
federacy, I will repeat a statement
made to me during the war by
Governor Letcher, of Virginia.
He had visited his home in the
Shenandoah valley, and on his re
turn to the State capital, called at
the house of an old friend who had
alarge family. He found no one
but the good old mother at home.
She told him that her husband, her
husband's father and her ten sons
were in the army. Can modern or
ancient history show a nobler or
more unselfish and patriotic devo
tion to any cause ?
"There have been, and there may
still be, those who affect to speak
lightly ofthe Confederacy; but a
cause and a country which it re
quired more than four years of ter
rible war, and armies of more than
two million men, and which cost
the lives of hundreds of thousans,
the expenditure of billions of dol
lars, and the sacrifice of other
billions of dollars worth of pr4erty
to overcome, can hardly be be
littled by any honest and sensible
man. We can well afford to wait
the verdict which history will ten
der on the men and women of the
late Confederacy."
If you need letter heads, bill
heads, envelopes, we will print
them.
The Gazette desires to state to
its good friend, Cal Hicks of the
Shreveport Progress, that it is not
disposed to write an indictment
against Mr. O'Malley of the Daily
Item. Far be it from our purpose
to disturb the admiration which
any one might have for that person.
We repeat that O'Malley's worth as
a citizen is, and will continue to
be, a mere matter of individual
opinion. Of course, we may be
mistaken. O'Malley may be a
winged emissary from the ethereal
regions, but in the absence of better
proof, we prefer to believe that he
hails from a less favored country.
The guarantee in the pocket of
each pair of the BUCKSKIN
BREECHES is put there as an
evidence of good faith. It means
that we believe the pants are so
good that you can't find a faalt in
them. You can call on your
dealer for another pair or your
money. Just as you choose. That
is the best proof of an earnest effo t
on our part tp give you good pants
at the price of common goods.

The press dispatches report Mr.
McKinley as having appeared at
the Centenial Exposition at Nash
ville on Saturday "arrayed in a
white vest and a straw hat." The
Dingley tariff must have got in its
work earlier and deadlier than ex
pected if the President of the
United States is unable to afford a
coat and a pair of trousers in which
to appear upon State occasions.-

In the case of the State of Texas
vs. the Water-Pierce Oil Company,
tried in the District Court at
Austin, Texas, a few days ago, a
judgment was rendered canceling
the company's permit to do busi;
ness in the State on the ground that
the said company was operating in
the State in violation of the anti
trust law. The case was appealed,
and the final outcome will be
watched with interest.

marked: "'Our hens are setting on
eggs, our wife setting type and us
setting here thinking up news."
Somtething to Depend On.
Mr. James Jones, ot the drug
firm of Jones & Son, Cowdlen, Ill.,
in speaking of Dr. King's New
Discovery, sa)s that last winter his
wife was attacked with La Grippe,
and her case grew so serious that
physicians at Cowden and Pana
