APPLE BLOSSOMS.
‘Fairies, clad in pink land white, .
Pressing all the trees,
•Scenting all the atmosphere,
Calling forth the bees;
Decking all the orchard boughs,
In the garb of Spring-
Apple blossoms, beautiful,
I your praises sing.
Poets long ago have sung
Praises to you, rare,
Telling of your sweet perfume,
And your beauties fair;
Stars have shone for ages, too,
In the vault of night;
Still a taper yet may glow
With an honest light.
Therefore I may sing to you,
Apple blossoms sweet,
For the praise of 'honest hearts
Is forever meet:
Yet—this is a secret though,
And your truth will test—
I am writing, most, to please
Her I love the best.
She is apple blossom mad,
Works them into cloth,
Making eyelets here and there,
Like a lady moth;
And she would not let me rest —
Nothing else would do —
Therefore I have done my best,
Writing praise to you.

~~ ""I HE editorial quoted be-
low appeared recently in
the A"gusta Herald and
Jw touches briefly upon a
wjP- very important question
’ W * n social life of the
entire nation. While it is
q interesting by reason of
more so in the unconscious impulse it
gives to a multiplicity of other ques
tions. Seeking to dismiss the matter
with a few apparently sensible words,
it opens up a very wide field for
thought:
“Keep the Girls in the Country
Homes. *
“Much has 'been said and written in
the 'way of advice to keep the boys
on the farm' and little thought has
been given to the girls. Yet it is a
fact that not only to the boys but
to the girls also the city is an attrac
tion that draws, and in every city
may not only be found boys who have
left the old homestead in the country
with its strong shelter, but also girls.
“It is risky enough for the young
man to come to the city, a stranger.
Unacquainted with city ways he is
cruelly beset by the many tempta
tions which in alluring form will
meet him, and before which so many
fall. But tenfold worse is it for
girls. A boy may make a misstep
and retrace it; for a girl this is al
most impossible. One false step will
almost surely lead to others until the
fatal line is passed beyond which a
happy future is not to be found.
“Fathers and mothers in their coun
try homes may not realize this. They
may not know the burden of care that
rests on 'the hearts of parents in the
Under The Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
city, who are trying to steer their
children safely through the breakers
which line the pathway of young
manhood and young womanhood in
the city. Could they but realize this
'they would try to hold the boys on
the farm, and they would not under
any circumstances let a daughter
come to the city, among strangers, to
work in any capacity, unless they
came themselves to supply her with
a home and its protection.
“City life may look very attractive
in the view that those take of it who
can see only its outward and most at
tractive side. But all is not gold that
glitters, and that which glitters most
often is the greatest sham. While
undoubtedly there are opportunities
in the city which the country does not
afford, and girls as well as boys may
succeed, there are risks in the city
and temptations to lead astray which
are not to be feared in the country.
“And to these the inexperience of
youth should not be exposed without
the protection of parental care, and
certainly not the girls.”
Unfortunately, there is absolutely
no doubt of the overwhelming chances
for disappointment and failure that
must be taken by the ambitious coun
try girl who goes out into the world,
unprotected by family ties, unbe
friended often except for the casual
acquaintance picked up here or there.
The well-bred city girl who desires a
business career, has but to fit herself
for the occupation she proposes to
follow. With the well-bred country
girl, she must simply unlearn* many
of the old cordial ways that were a
necessary part of that close neighbor
ly association, where everybody knew
everybody else, hospitality was kindly
and without snare, and people sailed
under pretty true colors. She must
catch many new cues, and the burden
upon her is a double one. She and
the country boy have an uphill and
Chilly road to follow to attain the first
modest success that comes, if the
fates be kind. After that, they may
compete with the city cousins upon
favorable terms, for generally there is
a store of energy, vitality and ca
pacity for hard work derived from
the freer, hardier rural surroundings
that the urbanite does not possess.
As for the desperate danger into
which the really ignorant, unsophisti
cated country girl plunges in leaving
home for a big, strange town, it is the
shame of our civilization. It is said
that the Indian maiden could travel
from point to point among the tribes,
unescorted and unmolested, certain of
perfect respect and care from all she
met, or sojourned with, upon her
journey. The redskin girl was held
as a sacred trust. In America, civ
ilized 'and presumably Christianized,
we are advising practical seclusion of
for our girls, lest they be trapped by
those who traffic in White Slaves!
There is no question but that the
Herald is right as to the awful peril
that lies in wait for the helpless, con
fiding country girl. But is it the best
part of courage to try to build family
walls stronger and (higher and im
prison the girls even more closely than
ever? Isn’t that policy merely eon-
Jeffersonian
ceding that we are helpless to make
our country sufficiently safe for all
its citizens? There is no reason why
the cities should be maelstroms of
vice and crime. There are plenty of
excuses, of course. The main one, as
stated, is that the crowds are too
great, the places too big, the oppor
tunities for wrong-doing too abun
dant, etc., etc., for a big city to be
kept decent. That is equivalent to
saying that the 90 to 95 per cent of
respectable citizens are powerless to
control 5 per cent or less of the dis
reputable or criminal element. Which
is the veriest nonsense.
Crime, in the country, may be hid
den forever. In the city it is dis
covered within a few minutes, an
hour or a day.
No, it really is not from the so
cially dangerous classes that the in
sidious peril comes to the lonely, un
wary young girl.
It comes, primarily, from the
vicious double standard of morals.
The indiscretions of the city’s gilded
youth are matters for laughter and
genial chaffing. The indiscretions of
the unfortunate girl mean the tragic
blight of her entire life.
So, analyzing the subject, we find
even yet the general attitude of mind
on the part of most men of the world,
practically all the fathers of families,
is just this: “I will protect my
daughters; but any other man’s
daughters, or any orphan girls, are
no concern of mine. Let ’em look
out for themselves.”
This gives to the gill of a happy,
comfortable home, every advantage.
It strips all protection from the girl
who must make her own living; or
who has special talent to be de
veloped; or whose ambition is burn
ing and not to be appeased by a
pleasantly monotonous existence.
We must be a very weak, very in
efficient sort of people if we can not
dissipate some of these ancient fal
lacies and make every part of these
United States the legitimate heritage
of its girls, as well as its boys.
With the idea of keeping the coun
try girl at home, from the right mo
tives, I have every sympathy, but
none whatever as a makeshift for
“protection.” She has a right to go
to the city, when she will, and to be
safe there so long as she conducts
herself with even a moderate degree
of common sense. And she would,
be safe, if the men of this nation
were as chivalrous as they pretend to
be; if there were not so many human
wolves whose aim is to destroy, never
to protect, pure womanhood.
It so happens that just now, since
the report of the Country Life Com
mission stimulated interest in rural
affairs, that the exchanges have been
teeming with the say of
wives. Here and there, the happy,
cheerful and contented note strikes
pleasantly upon the attention, but,
for the most part, this about what we
find:
“I have been a farmer’s wife for
twenty-five years and have been much
interested in recent newspaper dis->
missions concerning country life and
jts problems. I know both froin ejp
perience and observation that the
average woman on a farm leads a
life of nerve-racking, souLkilling
drudgery and isolation, and that
added possessions do not seem to add
much to her leisure and social ad
vantages, although they may enable
her to have a larger house and better
furniture than her poorer neighbors.
Even if her husband thought he was
able to keep a hired girl—which 'he
doesn’t—the few girls who work for
wages prefer to work in town, and I
am sure I don’t blame them; and the
farm woman who has daughters of her
own old enough to help is generally
overworking herself to keep them in
school. When not in school the girls
work too, in many cases harder than
they should. Many farmers’ wives,
in addition to doing all their own
housework and sewing and caring for
their children, carry on some side line
of industry to add to the family in
come, others 'have a small army of
hired men to cook for during a con
siderable portion of the year, and at
all events, housekeeping on the farm
includes a multitude of things that
the city housewife doesn’t have to
do.
“I once heard a group of country
women whose husbands were all well
to-do ranchers —we call them ranchers
out here —discussing an eight-hour
law proposition. One said she did not
feel like advocating an eight-hour
law for her husband’s hired men
while she had to work fourteen hours
a day herself. Another said she never
got her work done until ten o’clock at
night, and a third remarked that she
favored a short working day for any
body who could get it, but if there
could be an eight-hour law or a ten
hour law which would take her in she
would think the millennium had come.
“Who is to blame? Not the farmer,
primarily; his own lot is only a little
less hard than that of his wife. You
don’t suppose, do you, that country
people like long hours of hard labor
so much better than other people do
that .they voluntarily choose a slave’s
life? No, the very fact that farmers
and their families do work harder
than most others shows that there is
an economic necessity for their so
doing; they must in order to live and
make a little provision for the fu
ture. Sometimes those who have a
good deal of property in their pos
session are badly in debt, or if one
mortgage has been paid off by untold
labor and privation they feel that
they must live within their income to
keep from incurring another. And I
have never yet (heard a farmer claim
that his net income would equal in
terest on the money invested with
wages for the work performed by
himself and family.”—Ellen Cook, in
American Magazine.
This letter is from one familiar
with Western farm life.
In the Augusta Herald, I think of
the same issue as the one containing
the editorial quoted, appears “A Plea
for Farm Women,” by Della Ander

paragraphs:
