NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
hae the rit to elet the right to select the r
in which the advertisemlent is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to rive us au hid it fore
advertising. The Popnlist is he
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
Without expressing ou1r own
opinion upon the questions that
now confront the people of Ala
bama further than to say that if I
there is fraud it should be wiped t
out and wiped out tnotr. The lon
ger frand remains unpunished the t
bolder it gets and the more deplor- I
able and terrible will be the results 8
necessarily consequent upon its I
overthrow. That it will and must I
le ove thrown is not an open ques
tion among the honest thinking
people of America. Whenever a
the ballot of the American citizen r
becomes subservient to fraud and
corruption then America ceases to a
be a republic and can he numbered c
among the most horrible despotismn
of the world. f
The Republican party and the i
Democratic party together have in- '
augurated a system of plunder b
that has been robbing the people e
for thirty years. It matters not
which of the old parties get to the c
crank it is all the time attached to
the same old mill, and the Demo- a
cratic party to-day is running it e
swifter and more persistently, and a
its products (the tramps) is being t
turned out faster than ever before. A
But the most tantalizing spectacle a
- the whole story is the way in t]
which these same peopre (the mas- 6
rsm of the people) are invited to
ollo t box to relieve their bur- l
brly to be ridiculed beforeand
r the eolection by being shown b
how much faster the machine can 1
count than the honest voter can
vote. This instance in Alabama is
only a repetition of what happened "
in Louisiana in which blood was
sled, and should the people of
Alabama carry out their threats
it will only be another instance in
which a like cause has produced
a like efect. This is only a logi
al result which is governed by a
rul, that kis irreprible and at the
stace are mere rumblings, mered
spomtanhoua outbursts sent forth as
warmnngs of the terrible commo- li
tion underlying the social struc- (
ture of this great government. a
Thase fraud, are committed and
th. despoiler ha. never disiof Me g
,i tmt has accepted his ill-got- p
im l- relyiag for his protec- t
oE the State or the Natiomal army.
Se h ommutingph i t- A
fair havt enttircl f:ile to exhibit
the moral courage to denrluntce the
(litrag'es conimlitted in Alba:una.
The oiiny conmment thov make is to
call (oy.?Kolb ('Pop.) a 'ccrank"
and liast "that (;ov. Jones is a
:vigorous fighter and it is Ibelieved
r that the militia will stick to him in
r case of trouble.." This is the only
c m(''IlIIent ulI n tllhi. serious condli
tion in Alalbama. We clip some of
-the COillnients of the 'l'imes-Deu1o
(rut of New It 'rlans :
S"E:ncouraged byv the incendiary
utterance.- of the M ntgo ery coiln
en'ltion, bollJ again puts forward
his claim to the Goveirnorship, die
clares that he will Iie inaugurated
Gove rnor on the first MIondav in
' l)ecember, and calls ua.on his sup
porters throughout the State to
i oeet in Montgomerv (on that (lay
and give their aid and co-operation
to installing him. It would look.
at first blush, as though this ap
ecal must eventually produce a
bloody conflict in Alabama next
month ; but we have no idea that
it will really do so. Kolb, while
talking in a very blustering man
ner. modifies his case by asking his
followers to act "in a lawful and
peaceful manner." Whereas the
only way in which he can hope to
accomplish anything a oull he ille
i gal and violent proceedings. More
over, (;o%. oJones is known to be a
very vigorous Governor and is not
lik'ely to stand much nonsense;
and, finally, the Kolbites have
played this game of bluster once
before and were called down. The
chances are, therefore, that the
Kolb movement will go no further
than the swearing in of that gen
tlemen as Go\ ernor who will await
- events and see whether any future
steps should be taken by him. It
is not likely that he will go as far
as in Louisiana between 1S72 and
1877, and it is to be hoped that
Alabama n ill be spared the misfor
tunes which visited Louisiana when
there were dual State governments
in existence here. They are likely
to be splared them. The people of
Alabama know better how to deal
with this matter to-day than we of
Louisiana did in 1S72 ; and the
Federal government will not inter
fore in domestic affairs now as it
did twenty years ago."
Now if our esteemed contemnpo
rary is so anxious to avert a repe
tition of the scenes of Louisiana in
the seventies, he had better join
the better element of people in
putting down ballot box stuffing
and fraud at elections, for he well
knows as well as many others the
cause of the great troubles inl
Louisiana spoken of by him, and
it must logically follow that the;
same cause will produce the satme
result now as then.
Senator Goodwyn, of Alabama,
offered a protest in the joint session
of the House against the counting
of the vote until the charges of
fraud , from fifteen counties bad
been investigated. This protest
was signed by forty odd members,
but the Senator was not permitted
even to read it and was threatened
with the doorkeeper to seat him in
case he did not submit.
Now this conduct on the part of
an autocratic speaker convinces
every honest thinking man that the
alleged fraud was so palpable that
the despoilers dare not investigate.
A solemn protest charging fraud
and signed by a large per cent. of
the honorable members of the
Senate and House certainly de
serves consideration, and an abso
lute refusal is conclusive evidence
that the fraud was too palpable to
bare an investigation. This must
lie stopped and those who are resp
ing the spoils of fraud through
such methods had better take warn
ing in time.
AS OTHERS SEE US.
The Indianapolis Daily Journal
gives the following interview with
C. F. Kennedy, Secretary State
Board of Agriculture of Indiana,
who attended the Shreveport Fair,
and hence was there on election 4
day: 1
Mr. Kennedy spent election day 1
at Shreveport and says there was
little interest in the event. Hun
dreds of business men did not vote
and appeared to be pretty well
satisfied with the result of the
election all over the country. He
gathered the impression that the
prominent men of the State feared t
to encourage the Democratic ad- t
ministration by casting their hal
lots for their State ticket, anmd ~
rather than vote with the Republi-I f
cans remained away from the polls. i i

"How manv votes i ill he east in

a tr:iunt -h)king I lenocratic sliher

"I ust a'1s lili votes as w1 e

Is there a wor's account he

And the Shreveport Time(s co(n

next (ongress shouhld he found hon
est enoulgh to throw oult "just as
imany votes as we neel," or dechlare
noi election in the Fourth District
and send Mr. ()Ogden blck to see if
he could again outrage the honest
people who voted for him by buy
ing "just as many votes as we
need."
Mr. Kennedy's statement, and
the Timeics endorsemelnnt of it. shows
how 1Wooi1 votes were rolled Iip in
Shrevelport, ilnd another 11lii in
Alexandria, and another in the lit
tle town of Bkenton, although
"there was little interest in the
event and hundreds of business
meiln dtid not vote."
Will the good honest citizenis who
suppllorted Mr. Ogden in good faith
and who would not for a mlolment
think of stooping to such methods

them feel the insult cast upon them
by their ,party anll are ready to en

struggle for justice anti right.
Many of them will not support
AMr. Ogden in the next Demlocratic
primaries if he accepts the seat
tenderel him by such dishonoralble
methods as were used in carrying
the five parishes above.
There are enougn good people,
even in the I)enmoeratic party, to
frown down and wipe out such
methods, if they will only arouse
themlnselves to the enormnity of the
crimles.
Honest Elections.
As usual, the State press have
conmnonet their howlings for fair
elections, and at preent advocate
sweeping reforms in the election
laws, only to fight later on any law I
that will tend to bring albout the
results for which they clamor so
vigorously. Now the truth of the
whole miatter is this: they are
afraid of the great mind-molder of
the nltases---public olpinion-and
are seeming to delude the North
er, people by pretendilig to dte-l
lplore the election fiauds do(wnn
South, while In reality nothibg
suits them better. They deplore
the filct that the election law was
not adheredl to very strictly and
urge its enforcement to the very
letter.
Now they well kinow that thei
election held in this State was in 4
Ino way, shape or form, controlled I
by the election laws now used. If 1
any one can infolnm us why the i
same law gave us a fair count in j

Why Sabine had a fair election and

it is currentlv relported that the

because he is receiving his instruc

have fortunes so gigantic as to
have attracted the attention of the
entire world. Some of these are
widows of deceased millionaires.
Some are men iln charge of some

THE GEORGIA ELECTION.
The Result Is Regarded as a Phenomena'
Victory for the People's Party.
The news from Georgia does not
seem to entirely harmonize with that
reiterated statement that populism is
dead in the south.
Georgia. in the general nature of
things. ought not to be a happy hunt
ing ground for populists. It has been
mightily honored by the democracy.
From it President Cleveland drew- to
the wonder and amaze of the
rest of the country-his redoubt
able secretary of the interior, Illoke
Smith. From Georgia, too, hails the
statesman whom the national democ
racy through its majority in the house
of representatives made speaker-thus
giving him power second only to that
of the president. More than this, a
senatorial contest impends in Georgia,
Speaker Crisp being one of the chief
contestants. The legislators elected
Tuesday will have a senator to choose.
There was every possible incentive for
the democrats of the state to turn out'
in a body and vote the straight party
ticket
Yet the latest news from Georgia is
Sthat the populists have made enormous
I gains, and their vote is growing rapidly
as the returns from the back counties
come in.
Their success overthrows all demo
cratic plans for the senatorship, and if
a democrat be elected to that office he
will have to be a true Jeffersonian
committed to free silver, the income
tax and the rights of the people. It is
a phenomenal victory for the people's
party.
It were idle to attempt to minimize
the importance of this Georgia election.
Whether it may be taken as an indica
tion of what is to be expected of other
southern states is a mere matter of
speculation, but that it will vastly en
courage the populist managers all over
the country is but natural. TheTimes
expects that the one great surprise to
hide-bound politicians in the returns
of next November will be the showing
made by that young giant of politics,
the people's party.--Chicago Times.

People's party advpcates make re

matter of issuing bonds. A great

STRIKE AT ONCE.
If the People Would Avoid a Military Dee
potism They Must Move Quickly and De
eisively.
It must be observed that, so long as
i the plutocracy was able to protect the
"scabs" with its own body guard of
Pinkerton detectives and other private
agencies, it was very slow to call for
aid upon the public authorities. Ifav
ing used the public powers of legisla
tion to confer upon itself all the re
munerative public franchises and pub
lic functions, it was loth to use the
public baronets, not in the defense of
its privileges and property, which never
were seriously threatened by strikers,
but for the protection of "scabs" who
were expected to flo most of their own
fighting. The plutocratic class evi
dently realized that the use of all the
public powers of repression for the ac
complishment of its personal ends
would inevitably, sooner or later, shift
the lines of the conflict on very danger
ous ground, that is, make it obviously;
a class conflict, for the possession of
the public powers.
Well, in the natural course of events
we have at last come to that Owing
chiefly to the deserved odium which
attaches to the Pinkertons, not to
speak of the obvious illegality of their
employment, the militia and even the
The Way the Leaders of Orgetusled Labor

At a recent meeting of the Trades
and Labor assembly of Chicago, Mr.
Thomas I. Kidd. of the Machine Woodl
workers' International union, said:
"There is one other subject I want
to say a few words on. Some of our
prominent trades unionists are candi
dates on the republican and demo
cratic ticket. I want to say I think
they made a mistake when they ac
cepted such nominations, and I believe
every workingman who votes for such
candidates makes a more serious mis
take. Those men, if elected, will be
bound to follow the lead marked out
by their party leaders. You all know
what that means. It means the per
petuation of the same old conditions
which you find so oppressive now. It
is a camunpaign of principle; you must
not lose sight of that fact for one min
ute. No matter how good a friend of
labor a man may have been he loses
his individuality when he easts his lot'
with either of the old parties. Then
don't be fooled into throwing your
vote away for any sueb. Vote for,
principles, which means the people's
party ticket"
Another prominent labor leader said:
"We union men have always man
aged to agree for 364 days in the year,
but when it came to the three hundred.
and sixty-fifth and most important day
of our year-election day-we have al
ways fallen out. By dividing our vote
on that day we have set aside all the
good work we accomplished during
the remainder of the year. Our condi
tion reminds me of the oase of the lady
who went out for a ride on a tiger.
When she came back she was riding
inside, while a smile lit the face of the
tiger. The workingman has trained
frst with one and then with the other
of the two old parties, and in both in
stances it was another case of tihe lady
and the tiger.
