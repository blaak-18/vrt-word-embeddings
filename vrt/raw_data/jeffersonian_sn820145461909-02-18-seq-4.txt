DOES THE CHURCH TODAY FA
VOR WAGE SLAVERY?
Dear Jeffersonians.
“Foreign Missions” in the January
issue of the Jeffersonian was a most
timely article. While some if not all
the churches acknowledge that they
are losing influence, especially in the
cities —well, they are losing it in the
country, too, and for the simple reason
that their congregations are learning
that the preachers dare not talk of the
horrible conditions existing in our
own land.
They dare not tell us the truth for
they are supported by the capitalist
class, consequently it is to their in
terest to keep the masses in ignorance
as to existing conditions.'
Sunday after Sunday they hand out
that same piece of advice, “Slaves,
obey your masters.” They preach to
us a prosperity we do not possess and
bewail the fate of “the poor heath
ens.” Ye gods! Even we don’t need
charity, but justice, and yet our min
isters dare not preach that for fear of
losing their jobs.
The church today favors wage sla
very just as in the past it favored
chattel slavery. If the preacher (the
average) knows that the fat checks
dropped into the contribution box is
the price of debased and prostituted
womanhood he doesn’t care.
What does he care if his support is
the life blood of helpless women and
children crystallized into the almighty
dollar? I have heard miserable ex
cuses for preachers plead to congrega
tions of mill-workers for foreign mis
sions when many of these toilers had
only a few days’ wages between them
and starvation. Go where you may,
in country or city, you will find the
preacher upholding the class who con
trols the dollar. No wonder the cry
of losing influence has been raised.
We have asked for bread and been fed
on stones until we are past digesting
them. We ask for the truth and are
given excuses galore which are not
satisfying.
If the preacher would reach his peo
ple he must needs understand them,
but so long as the church is a slave to
capitalism and the preacher a slave to
the church, we can look for no radical
changes. It is only the rich of today
who possess the religion of the “meek
and lowly,” for we poor toilers are
too poor —too poor! Ah, God! When
we furnish the wherewithal to care
for the heathen, support the preacher
and our masters and all charities, we
are ourselves fit subjects for charity
but too poor to be Christians from the
preacher’s viewpoint.
I would to God that every man who
undertakes to preach the gospel could
be carried through the cesspools of
vice in our cities —could he made to
feel that he is upholding the system
that breeds such. Again, I would
that he could be made to fee! the aw
ful pressure of poverty that we find
in our rural districts. 1 would that
he could hoar and heed that cry of
despoiled motherhood and murdered
childhood. Let him see fur himself
the destitution he has helped to bring
-—the suffering, the crime-—but, ah!
no, all this goes to make up his salary

—but enough, we who know of such
things have no respect for a ministry
which denies their existence.

ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN.
As w T e have been asked to express
our opinion on teaching children, so
much nursery lore, and fairy tales,
I will tell the readers what I think
about it.
I do not believe in it to such an ex
tent as we are doing it these days.
There are several tales in the fifth
reader of Alabama text books that I.
do not think children ought to be
taught. If they believe them it has a
tendency to make them superstitious.
I think we as mothers and teachers
ought to be careful what we teach
children, but when the tale is in the

Be not prodigal of thy love, dear woman,
Though often it be sought by many men;
All untried natures are but purely human,
And loving, may as soon unlove again.
Trust not a fancy, though a prince the giver.
Hold fast thy reason, though a little spark.
Our natures broaden, deepen as a river, —
The past grows dim, and what was light is dark.
j
Keep for the reading of thy would-be lover
The searching wonder of thy calm, sweet eyes;
Too often grace and wit are but a cover
Which grows more subtle as his virtue dies.
Some day the one for whom thy life was forming,—
Not the IDEAL, but MASTER OF THY FATE,—
Enters thy heart with silent, patient storming;
Conquers the realm that for its KING did wait.
Then if the memory of a former lover,
Some well-known glance, or loving trick of tone
Thrill o’er thy heart, its MASTER will discover,
And know the hidden past is not his own.
Keep for the ONE thy love and thy caresses;
Dimples and smiles and eager, sunny ways;
Innocent coquetries, and abandoned tresses,
The lights and perfumes of thy perfect days!
But till thou know, lest one thoq trust should
Change with time, not pleasing thee the same;
Keep thou the ice of calm, unshaken girlhood,—
A LILY white, defended by its name!

books that we have to teach, I see
no help but to tell them it is not the
truth and is just an allegory, and help
them to get the moral out of it if
there is any moral to get, which I am
sure there is not in some of them. I
think that was a brave and truthful
preacher that Sallie T. Parrish wrote
about. We have too much fawning
on some members in our country
churches, and I know it is worse in
the city churches. Just let a man be
able to pay a little more or say amen
a little louder than the other members,
and he can live as immorally as he
wants to and there is nothing said
about it. I have seen just such in my
church.
Os course, people have different
fersonian.
ideas of the height a, Christian life
should be. Some think we can sin
every day and then be Christians,
while others think we ought never to
get worried about a thing, if we do
we are sinning. If that is so, I am
afraid but few mothers with eight or
ten children are as good Christians as
we ought to be, as it seems next to an
impossibility to live wothout losihg
our patience sometimes.
I want to thank 'Mr. Watson for
giving us a page in his paper where
we can express our ideas on different
subjects.
If I could wield a pen as well as
Sallie Trueheart Parrish I would write
every week. Let us know on this page
how to address our letters. I would
have written before now but was
afraid my letter would not reach its
destination or if it did it would find
its way to the waste-basket, but I am
going to run the risk. Another thing
I wish to say —let us all sign our real
name and give our real address.
We of 'South Alabama are having
our first real winter day today.

SOLITUDE’S WORK.
The great spaces magnify the self
importance of the country boy, while
the limitations of the city boy make
him feel that he is an insignificant
atom, is the explanation given by a
recent lecturer of the fact that the
country boy so often forges ahead of
the city lad in life’s achievements.
This is true as far as it goes, but it
might go further. The great spaces
which give the boy opportunity to
remember that his was given domin
ion over all thing's offer him, also, a
wide and unobstructed view wherein
things assume their relative import
ance. Thus he is able to pursue with
out hindrance the things which count
for time and eternity.
A thousand and one gilded pleasures
blind the eyes of his city brother to
the nobler things of life, and he looks
back at the end of the journey with
the realization that he has done noth
ing of benefit to himself or to his
fellow-man.
Solitude, such as caused Selkirk to
cry out in utter loneliness, may not
be good for man, but there are times
when every soul needs a season of
rest and quiet, so that they may right
their course and keep in view the
better things.

DISCARDED.
From home I sent you, just a week
ago—
Not that my love for you was grow
ing less—
But that it grieved and saddened me
to know
How quickly time could mar your
loveliness,
And though to let you leave me I was
loth,
A change, thought I, might benefit us
both.
When first your dazzling beauty
caught my eye
ou were indifferent to the staring
crowd,
And quite unconscious of the fact
that I
To make you mine impulsively had
vowed —
For all things have their price, and
may be bought,
And you had yours—though some
what high, methought.
And now, all torn and tattered, you’ve
come back—
Your color faded, and your looks
forlorn,
And all in one short week —alas!
alack!
A costlier shirt than you I’ve never
worn.
But what avails this fretting and this
fuss?
The laundries always treat one’s linen
thus.
