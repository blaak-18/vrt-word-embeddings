THE AFTEfRMATH
SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ONE DAY AND
NIGHT IN SHREVEPORT
The Excitement a Reminder of the Lynching of Jones
anid Hill--A Shocking Discovery--Was an
dnnocent Man Killed and Cremated?
As said in the Sunday Caucasian's re- r
port of the horril c tragedy which was
enacted at the Matthews' home in this N
city, the truth when told, or the facts s
when narrated as obtained, are sufficient- 1
ly sensational, blood-curdling and ab- g
horrent without the indulgence in exag- r
gerations or gruesome embellishment. c
The excitement having been followed c
by the cool, sober sense of realization, 1
the mind in a review of the dark picture r
of reality is led to inquire into the de- i
gree of satisfaction which may be de- s
rived from the cremation of a lifeless s
body.
It is true that the sheriff, the mayor f
and the chief of police had the body of t
the supposed murderer moved beyond r
the reach of those who clamored for it, n
and they did not anticipate its removal r
from the cemetery to the Levee, and
therefore they must be held blamelesss
for the action of the mob, who, in cre
mating a dead body, removed an im
portant link in connection with a tragedy
which appears to be shrouded in the
deepest mystery. It was a mistake! A
serious mistake.
THE CORONER'S INQUEST.
It is due Dr. Coty, coroner, to say that
he contributed his best effort and long
experience in trying to unravel the hor
rible crime, and to assist him he had as
jurors five gentlemen, Zach Howel, J.
nett and H. A. Fetzer, who rank with
H. Prescott, James Keeney, Albert Bar
the best and most reliable of the com
munity, men of judgment, conscientious,
conservative, fair and impartial men. It s
could not be possible to have obtained a I
better jury. These gentlemen deliberated t
long and earnestly, and on Sunday af
ternoon they reached the conclusion t
that Mrs. Alice Matthews had died from r
wounds inflicted by a person unknown to r
them and urged a thorough investiga
tion by the grand jury. This conclusion t
is remarkable and is doubtless without I
a precedent in Caddo parish and is
striking in the face of the sensational re
ports given in public print and in the
face of the fact that a man claimed to t
have been the murderer had been shot
and killed. The doubt of the jury is sig
nificant and still more direct when they
urge a thorough investigation by the
grand jury.
WAS AN INNOCENT MAN KILLED
AND CREMATED?
--The horror of -Saturday is- intensifed
by the report that the man shot and
killed Saturday afternoon and whose
body was burned on a pyre after mid
night Saturday had no connection what
ever with the murder of Mrs. Matthews.
On the authority of Mr. Cal Vance
and Mr. Stinson, most reputable and
reliable citizens of Bossier, it appears
that Albert Washington, the negro
killed, was innocent. Both of these gen
tlemen stated positively and without re
servation that Albert Washington
worked on their place all day Friday;
that he was on their plantation Fri
day night and Saturday morning; 1
that he, with some other negroes,
got on the Cotton Belt train at so
o'clock Saturday morning, and that after
reaching Shreveport on this train Satur
day, he went to the hospital, where he
expected to find his wife who had been
sick, and on being told she had gone to
DeSota parish, he announced that he
would walk over to see her, and
bidding his companions goodbye, he
started on his journey. It was while
journeying to DeSoto that he got on
the Kansas City Southern track, and
it was while he was in a cut on
the K. C. S. rond that he was halted by
the police, and running away instead of
stopping, was shot and killed. Both Mr.
Vance and Mr. Stinson stated that sev
eral of the negroes working on the plan
tation and who were in this city on hear
ing that a dead negro had been taken to
Willis's, the undertaker, called there to
see the body, and that these negroes
identified the body as that of Albert
Washiuigton, who got on the train with
them at about so o'clock and reached
Shrevsport with him oq the same train
sing . Thse satemnts re startlin&
C
ments of Mr. Vance and Mr. Stinson p
were under discussion certain officials a
whom it is unnecessary to name grinned g
sardonically and stamped almost at one F
breath the whole story with discredit, 1
giving in words the assurance that the c,
right man had been killed, and there t(
could be no doubt about it. Against such a
conclusion it were senseless to reason, ci
but as we have said and repeat, it is sig- t(
nificant that the coroner's jury, compris- tl
ing five as intelligent, prudent and con- a
servative men as can be mustered for a
such duty in Caddo parish, not only hes- I)
itated but have called on the grand jury L
for a more thorough investigation? If R
these five men had believed that the w
man killed was the man who had com- tl
mitted the murder, would they not have f,
reached their verdict accordingly? b
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES s
WAS THE MAN KILLED. n
The man killed, Albert Washington, h
was in a railroad cut of the K. C. S.
about five miles from Shreveport. He
was walking briskly. He was carrying
his coat. He no doubt had espied some
of the policemen who were scattered in g
that vicinity. Under-amental -strain hen
was easily intimidated, and when halted d
by the officers who confronted him, he
became excited, and when asked about
blood as alleged being on his person, he n
started on a run, pursued by the officers "
by whom he was shot and killed. n
OFFICER SJU TIFIED.
Under the circu the oicers n
wIere justifiedltw
It is to be regretted that they could not t,
take him alive. The officers acting under s
authority of the law could not permit d
the escape of a man who they had every
reason to believe, especially by his run
ning away, was the man they were seek
ing. If under the same circumstances
the negro had been met by a sheriff's a
posse and had ran away he would doubt
less have been killed. Viewed therefore
from every reasonable standpoint the
officers are justified. Had they permitted
this man to escape they would have been d
censurable. But to emphasize how easily
and readily a negro may become intimi- t
dated and stampede under the strain of I
fear, it may be recalled that soon after
Mr. Foster had been murdered a squad
of armed men appeared in sight near
a
Bossier City. In a stable was an old ne
groo who, on seeing the crowd, jumped
out of the stable and ran away. When
called to stop he only increased his
speed. He was fired at and shot, and then
taken to Schumpert's Sanitarium. He re
covered and is attending to his funs
r
tions as usual in Bossier. He had no
connection whatever with the crime, but
lost his senses and stampeded at the
sight of the armed men. The sense of
stampede is uncontrollable, and some
brave men have been known to run away
when stampeded.
BLOODY HAND AND FINGERS.
One of the strong points of the au
thorities in maintaining that Albert T
Washington was the murderer of Mrs.
Matthews is that when shot and killed
r his finger nails and hand were bloody.
- Can it be said positively that when i
this man was halted before he started to
I run away that his hand was bloody and
3 that his clothes were bloody? But Mr.
e Vance and Mr. Stinson are confident
I that there was no blood on the hands or
e the clothes of this negro when he got on 1
e the train Saturday morning at 1o o'clock,
a and the negroes, his companions, give
1 the same assurance. This is somewhat
a perplexing, but let reasou be applied.
Y Men familiar with blood and shots and
f wounds, men foir instance who were sol
Sdiers during the days of the Confeder
-acy, will concede from experience that
-when a man is shot, unless completely
-disabled or killed, that the first jimpulse
o is to throw the hand to the Wound if it
0 can be reached. When shot, this negro
a was running; he was shot in the back.
rt one of the bullets striking below the
h skull a little toward the right of the
d neck. Did not this man thow his hand
U to the back of his necdq ~#e shot, alid
k hnrnnn n b~,~ # efoe e elanduin
from his breast run into his pants, and
did he not become more or less bloody
from these shots? Blood when smeared
on the hand would dry rapidly, and
blood when dried during several hours
could not have been scraped off with a
knife. The man's coat was bloody, nut
this blood came from the wounds in
flicted by the officers.
A SINGULAR FEATURE.
Alluding to this coat, it may be said
that it was not Albert Washington's
coat, but Ed Porter's, a negro well
known in Bossier. When Albert Wash
ington got on the train Saturday morn
ing, by mistake he took and wore off Ed
Porter's coat. This coat should then es
tablish in some degree, if not altogether,
Albert Washington's identity. In this
coat, which was in Albedt Washington's
possession when killed, there was an
account in Ed Porter's name. It was for
goods purchased by Porter from the
Benton Mercantile Company. There was
no piece or part of a ring found in this
coat, but a piece of glass which belonged
to Ed Porter and the same Ed Porter is
alive i- Bossier. This may be "a coin
cidence," as said an officer when his at
tention was directed to the coat, but
there is another Ed Porter who may be
a "coincidence." It will be recalled that
an officer identified beyond a doubt the
body as being that of Ed Porter of the
Union Depot, but when so informed Mr.
Keeney, one of the jurors of inquest,
was not satisfied; so he went in quest of
the Ed Porter of the Union Depot and
found him alive and well attending to his
business, and the negro expressed his
surprise to learn that he had been con
nected with the case-did not know that
he had been killed and cremated.
ANOTHER BLOOD THEORY.
On the report of several friends of the t
Caucasian it may be said that the blood 1
visible on the shirt and pants of the ne- f
gro at the time he was halted and killed b
by the police, was from his handling of e
meat at the slaughter house on his route t
down the railroad. It is stated and it is t
believed that can be substantiated by wit- s
nesses, that when passing by some held s
was needed to handle the beef, and the
negro was called to assist, for which he t
was given a silver quarter of a dollar. b
which is in the possession of a gentle
man who may produce it in time. It may v
e said that this' was an unfortunate s
transaction for the negro, and it was.
since it may have led, innocently, to his t
death. s
IF AN INNOCENT MAN WAS e
KILLED WHO IS GUILTY?
This case with all its "coincidences"
and perplexities and its startling feat
tires appears to be plain and clear when
practical thinking and logical reasoning
is applied to it.
If Albert Washington was the mur
derer, why did he loiter about and delay
his escape when he had opportunity to
walk not less than twenty miles from the V
time the deed was accomplished to the a
hour when he was shot and killed? 2
How could Albert Washington have I
been in Bossier, as stated by Mr. Vance s
and Mr. Stinson and others, and be at
the place fhen and where the crime was
committed? C
His flight when called to stop is ex
plained by the parallel of the old negro
in Bossier who fled at the sight of the
armed men and was shot. Again, is it
not reasonable to suppose that he had
discovered his mistake in taking the
wrong coat, and that he thought the of
ficers wanted him for stealing it?
There has been a mistake. As well ad
mit it and go ahead on some clue and
catch the guilty man. Every law-abiding
citizen is concerned in this case, and I
there must be no rest, no cessation of I
activity and vigilance. Who is the guilty I
man?
RIDICULOUS THEORIES.
One of the ridiculous theories palmed
off sensationally on an intelligent public
is that the murderer got into Mrs. Mat
thews' room through a window facing
on the street; that after accomplishing
a heinous crime he went to this window
with bloody fingers, changed hi! mind
and then unlocked the door leading into
the kitchen; then walked into the yard,
secured the ax, retraced his steps to the
victim's side, then killed her and almost
killed her daughter; walked out a sec
ond time, threw away the ax and disap
I peared.
THE CORRECT THEORY.
The correct theory, sustained by rea
l son and circumstantial links, is as was
r indicated in the Sunday Caucasian. The
e murderer was no stranger, that is, he
t was familiar with the premises. His in
tention was not the heinous crime. He
: came at an hour best suited for his pur
e pose. Finding the kitchen door as well
e as the door of Mrs. Matthews' room un
f locked had easy access. Before going
I into the 1 se he secured the ax which
a was convenient and lay in his way in the

side. So brief was this crime that not a ali
single inmate of the house, occupied by , er
several couples and members of the fam- ar
ily, heard a noise. This misfortune was in
made known to them several hours after it
the crime. The criminal left no clue. mi
There was on the floor of the kitchen a ap
footprint in blood which may not have pr
been left there by the murderer. In the tic
excitement following the discovery of qui
the murder it is believed that some of din
the people in the house accidentally cis
stepped in the pool of blood by the bed- in
side and carried the imprint indicated. ha
This imprint would leave in the mind of
the impression that it is the print of a nc

with feet of that size who wore socks of* ol

inflicted indicated that the blows were cr

that have been reported and circulated. th
This tragedy is sufficiently gruesome a
when limited to facts to satisfy the most do
vitiated taste and sensational appetite. m
Why not be rational and reasonable?
MRS. MATTHEWS BODY.
Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock there at
was congregated at the Matthews' home ca
a large number of ladies and many citi
zens. The solemn rites were conducted to
by Rev. Mr. Mack of the Presbyterian te
Of
church. It was a heart-rending scene,
but the offlicted bore their bereavement
with remarkable fortitude. The body was
conveyed to the Union Depot, being
destined to Somerset, Ky., where it will
be buried. The disconsolate husband and
other relatives accompanied the remains
I) l
of their loved one.
w
ALINE MATTHEWS. ki
The little victim of her mother's mur
derer was doing well and improving a hi
little as reported by Dr. Schumpert, who i
entertains some hope of her recovery. at
She regains consciousness today and tc
when asked how she was injured, replied n
that she did not know unless she hurt la
herself by falling down the stairs. She n
is improving rapidly and may possibly p
recover.
A SOLEMN DUTY.
Because, as it appears from the con- a
necting links, that an innocent man has
been killed, will nor warrant the asser- t
tion that the right man is dead. The g
doubt is serious and seems to be direct a
and positive. If the wrong man has been g
slain, then the criminal is at large. It a
now devolves on the lawful authorities t'
to redouble their efforts and make clear a
and decisive whatever information to t
the contrary they may have to sustain a
their position. There should be no relaxa
tion or self-satisfaction because there
was killed a man who may have been in
nocent, a man who, it is fair to assume,
was not near the premises when the foul
deed was committed, but was in Bossier
miles away and whose presence in Bos
sier can be verified by gentlemen and
good citizens who saw the man killed
get on the train at to o'clock Saturday
morning, then get off the same train
when it had reached Shreveport. In tak
ing the stand we have, our motive is not
to intermeddle with the affairs of the
legal authorities. It is a fact that in more
than one instance we have assisted and
contributed to the arrest of criminals.
We are not seeing notoriety; indeed, no
Ima ca charge that we are moved by
or a spirit of sensation
alism. As a rule we are calm and delib
crate, and as a rule we know what we
are talking or writing about. We are
moved by a sense of justice. We bel
it would be criminal to permit the gJdkt
man's esctpe because the, death of Vw
appears to be an innocent man wot.
preclude further inquiry anad investiga'
tion. It is a serious problem; it is a
question which strikes at the very fus
darnenl at-uarani -f-p oreto C,
ciety. Let it be borne in mind that wiih
in the past eighteen months three vem-e
have been murdered in the limits
of this city and the murderes '
not been apprehended. One, d
gress, in Silver Lake, was kiled s
ax; the second woman was the
old nurse of the Tobinsky family, and
the third victim wa:-Mrs. M)atthkes. A
remarkable feature of each of these
crimes in that in the case of thewesa e
in silver Lake robbery was not thets=
tive, and there was not touched or talen
away any article of value from the loose
nor was it the heinous crimae It sppnn
that this woman was murdered thyo
a wanton spirit of revenge, promp- t
doubtless by jealousy. At any rshe
murderer is still a free man.
A SEARCHING INQUIRE.
In the case of the faithful od ael`
at the Tobinsky family the motive isce
explained. All there is positiv,. -4th
case is that she was killed withe &
of wood, and the murderer left as a
teriously as he had come in. There w'q
one arrest in this case, but the masl "'d
proved his ipnocence and was liberated.
In the case of Mrs. Matthews it was
not the heinous crime, and if robbery
wars intended The btrglar-wyas fr rt
doubtless through the awakening of bhe
victim, and to conceal and remove al
proof against him he killed. It is a fact
well established that a burglar will never
kill except in an emergency, but he willt
not hesitate to murder when detected I.
his burglary. However, it is positive that K
in two cases the murderers have alaedi
arrest ,and there is a doubt so stroras
to the third that it may be said that_ e
murderer of Mrs. Matthews is still at
large. Under this condition and in view
of the urgent recommendation of the
jury of inquest, the grand jury should
he convened immediately and with the
assistance of the district attorney- there
should be a most searching and thoeough
inquiry. It is due the people; it is sug
gested in the name of law and order and
a sense of justice which appeals to every
good citizen. There should be no delay,
nor should there be manifested-any hesi
tancy- of action for fear that it may
alarm the guilty man. Such a proposi
tion is ridiculous. Let every citizen be
active and on the alert while the mur
derer is alive and still at large.
The old reliable advocate of Democ
racy. the Mansfield Journal. says:
"There was a time in the history of
Louisiana when the best interests of the
people may have been subserved by
I ve ting autocratic power in the chief
executive, but there is neither demand
nor excuse for it now. The people
should have the privilege of electing all
their officers."
