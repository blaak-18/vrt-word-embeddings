shop where he could command a
view of opposite side of the river.
He remained in the shop until he

the river and caught the edge of
the skiff with his hand. Mr. King

(the stranger) turned his gun upon
King causing his death at once.

him through both arms, and to

Sub-committee on Coushatta Affair.
The last plank in the Radical plat
form lately adopted at Cincinnati,
Ohio, is the nail that closes their cof.
fin. It endorses Grant and his ad
ministration. If that is not sufficient
to sicken the independents (I) they
are made of stern stuff and their ra
vings about honest reform has been
cant. An unknown candidate put up
by a combination of Grantites and
weak-kneed reformers on a platform
that commends and sustains every
species of rascality done by the party
in the past is a pill that the indepen
dents must swallow. We would like
to see Carl Schurtz take his dose of
crow and have no doubt he will do
so without a grimmace. The people of
the Union, the honest reading, think- I
ing people must and will utterly re- f
pudiate such a thin attempt to foster
up a fallen band of plunderers as the s
Republican party has been and is. 1
The publication of the New Orleans r
weekly and daily Democrat was re- e
sumed on Sunday the 18th inst., un
der auspices which insure the com- a
plete success of the paper. Maj. H. Ia
J. Hearsey, that sterling patriot, has
entire charge of the editorial columns
with Win. Woelper, Esq., as man
ager. This will be cheering news to o
our fellow citizens, and they can It
now feel assured that the party has a e
journal in the city which will fully,
fearlessly and ably represent it.
The campaignri Democrat will be
furnished from 1st July to 18 Novem
ber for ONE DOLLAR. Let all sub
scribe.
----- --it
The grand total of all the appro- j,
priation bills before the House shows ft
that the Democrats have reduced the °
amounts $57,000,000 below the es- t
timate of Republican Cabinet officers
and $39,(,00,000 less than the Repub- o
lican appropriations made by them cl
for the tiscal year ending 1st July ult, ,
That is an evidence plain and prac
tical, of reform, but the Radical Sen- li
ate have refused to eoncur in the reduc- s
tion.. How will this be answered by rI
the American people? a
We 'have the faith to believe they d
will not stop short of a complete It
turning out of esuch a party as the
Republicau prove themselves to be.
The Democracy must present a uni- P
ted front, internal dissensions must
be adjusted, and -as important an is
sue as the welfare of the eonrtry de
mands that personal piques should be
set asde. Considering this the duty "
we owe to ourselves and our country, a
no device should deter us from at a
once coming to the front like men n
and patriots and nominating none but n

The "patriotism that pays" is beaun
tifally illustrated in thie drawing of
large salaries by the Commissiouers g
of thie Centennuial exhibition, appoint. t4

is Radicalism certainly. These Com- tI
miesioners were appointed to tmhe
position as a mark of honor, and b
they are drawing from the exhibition i

L- The Habit of Rreading.
' The fallowing, from Scribner's
e Monthly, contains some very sugges
tive thoughts:
S"I have no time to read," is the
common complaint, and especially of
women whose occupations are such as
to prevent continuous book persual.
- They seem to think because they can
not devote as much attention to books
as they are compelled to devote to
their avocations, that they cannot
read any thing. But this is a great
mistake. It isn't the books we finish
at a sitting which always do us the
most good. Those we devour in the
odd moments, half a dozen pages at a
time, often give as more satisfaction,
and are more thoroughly digested
than those we make a particular ef
fort to read. The men who have
made their mark in the world have
generally been the mete who have in
boyhood formed the habit of reading
at every available moment, whether
for five minutes or five hours.
It is the habit of reading, rather
than the time at our command, that
helps ns on the road of learning.
Many of the cultivated persons, whose
names have been famous as students,
have given only two or three hours a
day to their books. If we make use
of our spare minutes in the midst of
our work, and read a little, if but a
page or a paragraph, we shall find our
brains quickened and our toillighten.
ed by just so much increased sati
faction as the book gives us. Nothi
lung helps along the monotonous daily
round so muhel as fresh and striking
thoughts, to be considered while our
hands are.busy. A new idea from al
volume is like oil which reduces the
friction of the machinery of life. i
What we remember from brief glimp
ses into books often serves as a stimu- i
lus to action, and becomes one of the i
most precious deposits in the treasu
ry of our recollection. All knowl- I
edge is made up of small parts which
would seem insignificant in them
selves, but which, taken together, i
are valuable weapons for the mind, 4
and substantial armor for the soul. I
"Read any thing continuously," says I
Dr. Johnson, "anud you will be learn- I
ed." The odd minutes which we are
inclined to waste, if carefully availed I
of, will in the long run make golden
hours and golden days that we shall
ever be thankful for.
A Child of Shadows.
[From the Detroit Free Press.J
Months ago a Detroiter was sent to
the House of Correction for habitual
drunkenness. The wife, a hard-work
ing wom;a and sid'ely ºfliicted in
health, managed to provide'food and
fuel for herself and child until the
other day, when death came to end c
the struggle. The little girl, hardly
8 years old, was all alone iin the house
when her mother died. The event
occurred at dark, and at midnight the
child was heard singing in the dark
ness. A pedestrian who halted heard
het say:
"Mother, won't you wake up and
light the lamp I If you will I will
sing some more i"
Suspecting what had happened, he
roused some of the neighbors, and
as they went in the child sat in the
darkness, holding its mother's cold
hand and singing: /
The Lord will lead a little child
And teach me how to pray.

situatioo more desolate, and yet the I

said:
"I kept still a long wlhile to leti

cratic-Conservative party is to save
Louisiana, our people mast unite in a
general efforts to nominate good men
to all .,fices, from thie lowest to the
highest, and then, in one harmonious,
sustained and vigorous effort to elect
them. The platform must be, in
truth as in assertion, reform in every
branch of the government; the abol
ition ofall needles offices; the reduc
tion of all exorbitant salaries and 1
fees; in short, a remodeling of the
whole State government, with a view
to reducing its cost, increasing its
vigor, and lessening the burden of
taxation. Upon this platform every
honest mao in the 8tate can stand.
Why, then, should not every honest
ma. in the State do what lies in hIis
power to seeure the control of the
party to men whose character wihl
give a meaning to the platfotm, and
to insure the nomination of men
whose election will be a guarantee

The Republicans have been two
leag in power; in a free government
no party can be safely trusted to rule
for so long a term. They have also g
had too great majorlity In the country ,
and in Congress, leaving them almost
without responsibility. They have a

corrupt beyond all precedent. Their

Exterminating Bedbugs.
When all other means have failed to
exterminate bedbugs, sulphurous acid
gas has succeeded. Take everything
out of the infested room, plug up all
Sthe windows tightly, close all chim
neys, and empty about 1 oz. of pow.
dtered sulphur on a pan of hot coals,
placed in the middle of the floor.
Shut the doors and cover all cracks;
let the sulphur burn as long as it will.
When the room is large, it is a good
plan to fasten a bit of tin tube to the
bottom of the pan, and to this con
nect enough small rubber pipe to lead
out the nearest door. By blowing
into the end of the pipe with the bel
lows, the sulphllr will be caused to
burn more quickly by the draft crea
ted, and to give a denser smoke.
After the sulphur has burned out,
paint all the cracks in the floor and
around the mop board with a strong
solution of coirosive sublimate, and
treat the fuirniture to the same before
replacing it. We have seen a room
fright'ully infested completely freed
by this plan.
Sheep on the Farm.-That sheep
can save farms from otter ruin and
improve the condition of good farms,
is beyond doubt. However much we
may prize the horse and cow for their
valuable services to mankind, still
we must admit that the keeping of
sheep is very profitable to the farmer,
in that it brings money to his pocket
and improves the condition of his
land. Experience has shown that
sheep husbandry is directly profita
ble. There are no losses and very
few risks to be met with in the busi
Iness.
Early lambs, fat weathers, wool
and pelts always bring good prices
and find ready market. Besides,
sheep bring up the condition of the
farm, and as the old adage has it,
"turns the earth to gold wherever
their foot-prints are found." Noth
ing will improve a farm so well as a
course of husbandry in sheep, well
selected and judiciously followed.
Sheep can be made thle salvation of a
poor farm, and if more of our farmers
would keep sheep a larger share of
prosperity would be the result.-Ex.
Sleep is the Best Stimulant.-The
Jest possible thing for a man to do
when he feels too weak to carry any
thing through is to go to bed and
sleep fqr a week if he can. This is
the only recuperation of brain power,
the only actual recuperation of brain
force; because, during sleep, the
brain is in a state of rest, in a condi
ttio to receiveand appropria i ti,.
eles of nutriment fmrom the ~-lood,
which takes the place of those which
h:ave been consumed in plevious la
bor, since the very act of thinking
consumes or burns up solid particles,
as every turn of the wheel or screw
of the splendid steamer is the result
of consumiption by fire of the fuel in
Ile furnace. The supply of consum
ed brain substance can only be had
fronm the nutritive particles in tihe
blood, which were obtained front the
food eaten previously; and the brain
is so constituted that it can best re
ceive and appropriate to itself those
nutritive particles during a state of
rest, of quiet and stillness of sleep.
Mere stimulants supply nothing in
themselves; they goad the brain and
force it to a greater consumption of
its substanlce, until that substance has
been so exhausted that there is not
power enough left- to receive a sup.
ply, jianst as men are so near death by
thirst and starvation that there is not
power enough left to swallow any.
thing, and all is over.
A Home Recipe for Otto of Roses.
-At this time of the year, when so
many rose leaves fall ty the ground
and are wasted, every lady can, if she
chooses, manufacture a delicious per
fume at a cost of less than fifty cents,
and in a few minutes' time. Take a
two gallon glass jar, and fill full of
clean, freshly picked rose leaves.
Then cork it tight, and take a two
ounce phial and tit the neck into tIlre
cork of the two-gallon jar. Cut some
sponge into narrow strips; soak them
in good oil, free from rancidity, put
the strips into the small phial, turn it
upside down, and put the neck into
the bung of the large jar. Place
them in tire sun for four days, and
the heat will distil the rose leaves,
and the aroma will ascend and satu
ate the oil in thie sponge. Put in
"rench leaves about four times, and
you will have a small phial of the
inest otto of roses that can possibly
be made, and in quantity suffi8cient
to scent tim e lothee and handkerchief
of a family for a year. Pare otto of
roses cost $30 per ounce. He sure
and keep it well corked, or it will
evaporate.
Save Your Soapsuds.-Who would
brow away a barrel full of soft soap
or a box of bard soap? Were it not
othlerwise useful, it would be of great
value as a fertilizer, if spread, is its
raw state, about our fruit trees or
berry bushes, But, after being dis
solved in water and passing through
the wash tub, gleaning the impercep
tible elements of the besta manure
from soiled linen, its fertilisaing pow
er is vastly increased. Indeed we
may almost say that the average
soapsuds froqp the kitchen and laun
