"In vain do they worship me,
teaching for doctrine the command
ments of jlan."
Tihe Jewish religion at the coming
of Christ, had undergone consideras
Ible change in practice and ceremO
ial. When Moses led the Israelites
fronm Egypt tlhey were a rude and un
lettered race, although superior to
tile people around them, in that, they
retained an imperfect knowledge, and
worlship of the God of their fathers.
Th'eir ideas of thie mstl relations
and duties of men to eao ther were
vague and unsettled, yet ierlhaps as
full and precise as they were caps
ble of receiving; it was "burning
for Lhrning, wound for wound, and
strike for strike." Age after age,
had passed away, and they ht:4 growaj
into, a purer aid higher morality.
Much of the law of which Christ
said, "not one jot or tittle shall pass
away, had become not the less true,
but obsolete-meo had gone up high
er; they needed to be taught not only
the letter, but that spirit of the law,
which "maketh alive." They were
ready for the coming of the Divine
Person, whom a long line of Prophets
and promises had taught them to
look. But they expected that he
would take on him the royal state of
monarch, and leader, they "trusted
that it would have been He whibch
should have redeemed Israel." They
had no idea of the kingdom of peace,
that spiritual empire which was to be
established in the heart.
The Pharisees, whose tenacious
love of ceremonial, whose long pray
ers in the market-place, and ostenta"
tious alms-giving were to win the
praise of men, were a momerouas anad
iofluential class. Against these, the
meek and lowly one, as most opposed
to the spirit of his own kingdom,
pronounced his most severe rebuke.
"Woe nto yon scribes, Pharisees,
hypocrites, for ye bind heavy bur
dens upon mens shoulders, and
griaevous to be borne, and will not
toech them with one of your fingers
ye shlot up the kingdom of Heaven
against men, and neither go in your
selves, or suffer those who are enter*
ing to go in-ye pay tithes of mint,
and anise and cammina, and bare
omitted the weightier matters of the
law, judgment, mercy and faith-ye
teach for doctrines the command
ments of men." The teachipgs of
Christ were diametrically opposed to
all this. No outward washings, no
exterior observances could make up
for the inward purity he demanded.
The heart most e first eleansed; for,
"from within, out of the heart of
man proceed evil thoughts, thst
wickednesso, deceit, covetusess ; all
these thinf defile a man."
There is something so laainfinitely
lovely, so grandly sublime in these
words as they stand out like letters
of gold on the dark sky of those
times, that we can well conceive the
wonder with which the pieople cried,
"from whence theb, hath this man
this wisdom t Is not this the car
penters son, and are not his parents
here witlh ast"
Something more, sometling great
er than any obseryvee of bere ritgal
or law was to be obsefted. To the
women of Lamaria, he maid, "the
time is coiing, and now is, when Obt
in this mountali nor Iet luJarUsa
lem, men shall worshp the Fathet.
God is a spirit, sad theywlo wer

Sand truth." The kingdom of Heaven
- was to be withls theet, an Oltar was
r to be established in every eeart.

in Turkey, we should almost certain.
ly have been Mahomedaus, and like 1
true children of the crescent, have
shouted, "God Is God, and Mahomet
is his Prophet." St. Paul says, when
speaking of his persecution of the
Christians, "I verily thought I was
doing Gods service."
We look naturally apon theerrorsm
and crimes, which a wrong belief en. 1
tails with pain, but it should be a
feeling closely allied to pity. The
Rindioo mother, who to propitiate an (
angry Deity throws her child into the ,
Ganges, while every fibre of her be. t
ing must cry for its salvation, does t
so, impelled'by a deed, but mistaken r
sense of duty. I' iew far Is the gall- 1

virtuous action. What is virtue in r

'Are they then relative terms a have
they no fized meaning? Is not virtue ,

effort which the soul makes to do e
what it verily believes to be right,
and true.
The great Raler and Redeemer, I
earme while the world was lying in
wickedness, and moved with infinite i
pity for all these souls wandering Ino t

the Shepherds upon the Syrian plains, I
"'good tidings of great joy, which r
should be to all people." How has t
the Church tulfilled its high and r
holy mission ? As we look back opon r
the ages which have down, the bare s
and cruel facts of history mast ano. a
swer us. The longest, most desola. a
ting and terrible wars which have e
ever carsed humanity have been re a

MAJORITY REPORT.
To the Honorable President and Members
of the Senate:
The undersigned members of youear I
I Committee on the Judiciary, to which I
was referred House bill No. 103, eon
titled "An act to repeal act No. 25 of I
Ithe Legislature of 1865," etc., com. t
I monly known'as the act repealing the I
Louisiana Lottery Company's charter, I
beg leave to report the same favor- 1
ably, with the following ameadment
in section 6, line 2:
Strike out the words, "It paasge,s "
and insert in lieu thereof the word, I
I "the thirty-Brst day of March, 1879." 1
They have considered the propriety I
of the object had in view by the mov. I
era of the bill, and believe it to be a
Iproper one. a
In their opinion the present Lottery I
I institution is a standing reproach to 4
the State, and io its elects upon so- I
clety, can only be compared to a
I malignant cancer which is eating out I
the very vitals of the morals of the
