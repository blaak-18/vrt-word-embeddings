name Jeffersonian” is more than
they would care to tackle.
Understand, I am not trying to
lead, simply stating the matter as it
appears to me, and with but one ob
ject, the restoration of a party in
the United States, whose principles
are democratic, as our fathers under
stood it, and one to which every coun
try-loving man can rally.
Now is the accepted time—says the
preacher—and ] believe it to be as
true in politics as in theology, and
with some old hard-heads, J. J. Spear,
for instance, propose to organize a
Populist dub and commence a train
ing that will place them as regulars
among volunteers, i. e., a rallviim
point.
Glynn is a hard county to operate
in, but I see no reason why we can
not be successful, particularly now,
after the desperate effort to negroize
the present democratic party, which
turned so many votes, even to hated
republicanism. Taft’s vote in Geor
gia, I firmly believe, is democratic
condemnation; the people have said
to the party leaders, “Thus far, but
no further.”
With the disgust of the people for
such dirty work as recently prac
ticed, and hatred of republicanism, it
does seem that we could establish a
party upon democratic principles
that must sweep the field at an early
date.
In conclusion, permit me to say
that a Confederate soldier and a re
cons! ruction-days democrat, can see
neither safety nor decency in follow
ing Bryanism.
Wishing you success, I am proud to
subscribe myself.
Your friend,
Francis H. Harris.
CONDONES WATSON’S “MIS
TAKES.”
Oct, 10, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
Sir: The writer of this letter was
on the Populist ticket, in 1904, as
elector for the 2d district of Ohio.
He endorses every syllable of the plat
form of that party. More than fifty
years ago, in his humble way, he
helped form the Republican party,
lie is proud of much that that party
accomplished, but, like Christianity,
the party lias witnessed an “apos
tasy.” In the beginning the party
pledged itself, under all circum
stances, to stand for the wronged and
the oppressed everywhere, Now it is
the champion of the most brazen evil
our race has encountered. Instead of
“listening to the young ravens when
they cried,” it turned a deaf ear Io
their plaint. It adds to the crime of
treachery that of hypocrisy. The dan
ger to our institutions is not the ex
ecutive, nor the legislative, but the
judicial department. It is easy to
stand before the people as fighting
the trusts knowing they are safe be
fore that linal tribunal. That is just
what the apostate Republican party
is doing. The Democracy is no bet
ter. Our institutions must be so re
formed that the people can actually,
instead of theoretically, rule. That
means the “initiative and referen
dum.” Also the “recall.” lam for
all of them to the fullest extent.
1 have been a pretty constant reader
of your periodical literature, and am
much obliged to you for favoring me
with a year’s free subscription. It
more than evens up for what the
New York concern is in arrears. If
this reaches you all right I mean to
send for your “Story of France’' and
your “Life of Napoleon.” I feel a
curiosity to see what “Tom Watson”
has to say on those interesting topics.
In my very humble opinion his pen is
the most sincere, the most analytic,
the most logical and I lie mo - !
chant of all American writers. 1 linn
but one criticism to make. He some
times ruffles me a little by his ten
derness lor the “Confederates.” No
L gic can “justify the rebellion.” But,
Tom. “there is something right here
under my left vest pocket” that tells
me Io condone many mistakes and
forgive many faults in “Tom Wat
son.”
1 have a little space left and may
as well till it. At the close of the
civil war I was in favor of letting the
negro vote. I now think it a great
mistake. I am now inclined to think
that the negro, instead of advancing
under freedom, has actually and no
ticeably declined in manners, in mor
als, and failed to advance in industry.
It has taken the European thousands
of years to reach what they are, and
it will take the negro as long; per
haps he may never reach it.
With best wishes for your sneess,
1 am your friend,
Thos. A. Lane.
FROM HEADQUARTERS.
St. Louis, Aim, Oct. 30, 1908.
lion. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: I enclose you
copy of statement of this office up to
ami including October 24, when Mr.
Forrest ordered headquarters closed.
Uol. Feller has taken charge since
I hen and will keep up headquarters
until night of November 2. Regret
meageruess of results; had proper
organization taken place last May,
results would in many respects been
considerably enhanced, which would
have given good encouragement
There should be sufficient notice sent
out for a good attendance at the Na
tional Commitlee after November 4,
at which time there should be a re-or
ganization of the Committee. Stock
should be taken, and proper plans for
the future outlined, that the matter of
finances should be put in the hands
of business men, who believe in Pop
ulist principles and that men should
be selected Io conduct the affairs of
the Party who have business sense,
and executive ability and whose in
tegrity is unquestioned.
You can realize that the lack T
these things has put the Party where
it is and turned the attention of the
people away from that which is safe,
san? and constitutional to th : swing
ing from the extremes who guidj both
old parlies, to its logical counterpart,
the Socialists. Have sent my ~ub
scription to “World” and two Jeffer
sonians to Dixon and will read with
interest what you will have to say for
human beiterment in the coming year.
My sincere regards and best wishes,
I am,
Very truly yours,
F. Forrester.

A FRIEND WHO MODESTLY
THINKS HE CANNOT WRITE
—BUT WHO CAN.
Daingerfield, Texas, Oct, 14, 1908.
Hi n. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: 1 saw an editorial in the
Atlanta Journal more Ilian one time
saying Tom Watson was one of Hie
worst enemies to Democracy. Well,
that got the old boy aroused. So in
my simple way, 1 wrote an article to
the .Journal asking them to explain
how and in what way Tom Watson
was an enemy to Democracy. I send
you the article enclosed with t his let
ter and their reply —one “dew drop”
is going to quit falling over here in
Texas —not going to take it a minute
longer than it is paid for; it never
gave you- the credit you should have
when Hoke was elected. I have
taken the Journal, read it we
have your magazines. One editorial
of yours is worth more to educate a
fellow than fifty-two copies of the
Journal.
I wish I could write an article to
the people of old Georgia making an
appeal for you, asking all true-blue
Pops to stand by you, also all good,
honest Democrats. If you have the
time and space write an appeal to the
people of Georgia for me and sign
my name as if I wrote it. telling them
why you ought to get a big majority
in Georgia as one of Georgia’s own
sons. Appeal Io (he Pops, and I hen
Io (lie Democrats, asking and tilling
Hiem why they ought to support you.
W rile up a good one for me and sign
ns if 1 wrote it. I am a Georgian and
full-blood Pop.
Yours forever,
G. W. Starrett.
POINTS TO SUCCESS.
Harlem, Ga.. Gel. 2G, 1908.
Honorable Thos. E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Aly Dear Sir: I desire to extend
to you my hearty thanks for the sam
ple copy of your weekly Jeffersonian,
which reached me yesterday, which
has been read by me and thoroughly
digested.
Aly father-in-law is a subscriber
to both your monthly and your
weekly publication, otherwise I
would have been a subscriber- myself.
It is with much pleasure that I refer
to your masterly speech, delivered to
the Atlanta audience on the 7th of
this month, which was road very care
fully by the writer, and I consider it
one of the greatest efforts of your
worthy career.
Vour explanation of Bryan’s affili
ation with the negro, his general at
titude towards them relative to the
Brownsville trouble, is certainly
enough, in my opinion, io disgust Hie
most biased partisan, and cause him
to take up the white man’s tight. I
confess frankly that there was a time
when some of your most loyal sup
porters grew cold and indifferent to
wards you, some even becoming an
tagonistic to the cause of Jeffersonian
ism, back-tracking, as it were, but I
speak now from what I know to be
facts, that where they are not all
back into the fold, there are enough
new converts to more than balance
the few who deserted wlml 1 believe
the most worthy type of true Dem-
ocracy advocated before or since the
days of Jefferson.
I, of course, hear hundreds of ex
pressions traveling, as I do, from Vir
ginia, my native State, to the Ever
glades of Florida, and without doubt
I believe we an* on the very threshold
*>
of victory, perhaps not this year, as
you say, but with the path so bril
liantly blazed, the facts cropping out
before the intelligent voter as they
arc, so wisely predicted by you, I am
firm in my conviction that we will all
live Io see the party triumph.
Being a commercial traveler, I am
in a position to see a great deal more
politically than the stay at home, and,
feeling as I do towards our nominee,
T. E. W., it is with much pleasure
that I make these few facts known to
you, and my every effort shall be to
co-operate with Hie Jeffersonians,
thereby contributing my little help to
wards reaching the victory which at
one time seemed hopeless, but today
becomes a recognized fact and factor
in the political world.
'Sincerely your friend,
H. P. Walter,
“IF THE PEOPLE ONLY KNEW
IT.”
Taylorville, HL, Oct. 21. 1908.
Thomas E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir: I have voted the Popu
list ticket for the last thirty-two
years, and have taken your paper for
sixteen years. I am 83 years of age.
1 want one of your photos io hang
up beside Lincoln’s photo, on the wall,
and 1 lliink maybe 1. (‘an get some
voles for you. I am willing to pay
whatever the picture costs, for I sure
want it.
The reason I have not taken your
paper lately is because 1 can’t see
any more to read. 1 would give fifty
dollars to see you elected President,
lor you are the one for the interests
of Hie people, if they only knew’ it.
Yours respect fully,
John Shetlar.
