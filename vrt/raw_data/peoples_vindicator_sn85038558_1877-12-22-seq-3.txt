Carr,'Dave and John, and a nephew usa
maeThompson who sided with his uncle,
bave'Carr John Carr was shot in the
leg by Thompson, who with Dave Carr,
nlated the sheriff's posse sent to arrest
them for said shooting. Sheriff shot
Dave Carr lu the bowels, and Thompson
escaped.
Sealed proposals will be received at this
office for a good sized club; not a stuffed
one but one with which to knock the
tuffin' out of a lot of subscribers who
are bound to read the VINDICATOR, and
never feel themselves under any obliga
tions to pay for it.

Otr merchants and business men were
indignaat that Capt. Sinuot failed to
bring down the Bart Able to our city.
The water was over a foot higher than
last trip when he did come, and near 500
ý'llc of cotton is waiting for shipment.
The talk was of agitating an independent
line of boats, end we are sorry to say
that the shippers have good cause to be
angry with the Bart Able for treating
them in such a manner.
Tlhre are said to be two beautiful girls
engagi'd in the barber's business in I)e
troit. Of course a good deal of domestic
anxiety is the result All the bald-head
ed old rascals who always take the frout
seats in the pit at the ballet are hiaving
themselves shaved to death, weeping se
cretly, but bitterly that they have no
hair to shampoo. What a ridiculous hld
', orld this is -the bald-headed p:u t of it
especially.- Ex.
It will no doubt gratify tihe pItit ,n- S1
Iros whose verdict was set aside on Sat- i
urday I Ist in the case of Cato ,John.soi, im
charged w ith the larcen,-of cornl to know
that the said Cato has been prosecuted n
anid convllicted for the Crinli of "'feloious- Si
lv anll fanlldllletly severilng the conll
froml the soil of the owner," anid that his
punishment will he none the less for the e
technical advantage he had in the first
case. 1Up.I tilhe return of the verdict of
guilty into Court in the larceny case the r
.Juidg set it aside on the ground that I
corn upon the stalk savored of the reality
,Land was not a sublject of larceny. Where
upon the astute Districts Attorney, who t
had not been infornled before the trial of
the facts in the case, di isll issed the indict
niiiet anld filed an information chargilng
the crime of sevrring from the soil felo
niously alnd upon which Cato was con
victed. So the j*iurors who COllvicted in
the fitst instanlce need feel no alarmll that
a :main iwhose guilt tIhey thought so clear
Iv rIestablished will escape pnunishnment for
his crime ; the law is quite ample for the
case; tihe only trouhld was that the party
wa.,s not properly inllicted in the first ease.
Our Carrier boy, Master lpsliur .Bre'a
zeale, will present thlierltrons of the
Vi,'s"oi'n, with a New Years' Addres s
a greetiing to all on the happy occasion. We
sincetrely trust our friends wil. patronize
him liberally, for he certainly deserves
tevery enellcragenlleit. We cannot re
frain from citing him as an example
worthy of ioitation. Born of parents of
wealth and intlence, who lost their all i
in our strug le for liberty; reared by a
deserling f;ratihr, and. tender and excel
lent mother, this youth presents a con
tra-t, striking indeed to the corner-;oaf
ing, cigarette smoking skulk. Instead of
repining fir lost property, and weeping
over his changed condition his parents
taught him to accept the facts as they
stood, and to work ! And well hlave his
father and mother been recompensed.
Entering our otlice as a green boy it took
Sbut a short while for ',all hands" to learn
"'what stuff" was in him. Indnstriouls,
truthfil, and above all, honest, and aemx
I ions as well as willing to learn., he has
advanced rapidly in the profession he has
I marked out for himself, We predict for
h himt a bright an honorable future-a un
ture in which he will be an ornament to
the "craft." a pride to his parish, andi an
[ honor to his family.

r Which we judge is a very large collec
at lion taking into consideration the pover
Lhc ty of our people. The delinquent lists
,O are very small. A term of the Court, two
Circnses, and $52,000 in taxes is a very
ivi- heavy drag on the cotton crop of this pa
,n- rish, not to say anything of the mules
the and meat which will have to be paid for.
Our late Grand Jury have, by a sin of
omission, rendered themselves liable to,
and have been the subject of, much and WI
severe criticism. They were specially
charged among other things, to enquire 01
into and "true deliverance make" of cer
tain parties who have been engaged in
the sale of spirituous liquors without ha
ving been licensed therefor. A failure n
to procure a license from the State before
proceeding to deal in liquors subjects the
offender, by speciall Statute, to severe
pains and penalties. It is said that the g
law officers brought thi3 matter directly
and personally to the recognance of the
Grand Jury, and that the Tax Collector
fiurnshed them with a list of the names
of parties who had been trafficing in li
quors contrary to the laws of the State,
in such cases made and provided ; and it
t is further said that the Grand Jury did
I then and there vote not to take action in
the matter.
The Grand Jurors are sworn to examine
1 Into all ea.es reported to them, and these
cases were without doubt so reported.-
The law admits of no evasion, and it
d seems to us, as severe as the criticism is
t and may be, that it is well deserved. If
we are to have a government of law
which favors one class to the extent of al
rd lowing it to violate the law, it were well
C. itjis known. Laws can be violated by
is selling liquors without a license as well
as by stealing a hog or carrying coucetl
!re ed weapons-and then they can be viola
to ted by a Grand Jury even, when refusing
- to take action in cases brought specially
an to their attention. Staud up gentlemen
00 of the Grand Jury and receive the bles

The BoNssu: Li:l: visited our wharf on
Wednesday last and went sailing up the
river without touching a bale of cotton.
So Capt Sinnott's statement of his "hav
ing done the best he could for his pa
trons by sending the l1monie Lee, as h,
couldn't collie himself," turns out to he
a Loax of the largest miagnitude. The
indignation of our merchants and cotton
buyers was very loud and not at all
complimentary to Capt. Siunott, the po, I
line and lhe river men geinrally We
see no excuse flir Capt. Sinnott refusing
to come in, to Natchitoches at least,
with the lart Able, and lihe has treatedl
the people here very cavalierly, wlliclh
they in no measure deserved, and which
they are resenting in no mild manner.
Some shippers were tongue lashing the
genial and handsome agent, but it was
finally voted that he was simply a victim
I of misplaced confidence in Capt. Sinnott,
I as the shlippers, while they wended their
way, sorrowfully and cussingly home, fil!
