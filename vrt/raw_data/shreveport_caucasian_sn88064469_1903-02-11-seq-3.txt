NEGROES WHIPPED.
The Affair Has Caused Considerable Bit.
ter Feelings.
Fayette, Mo., Feb. 11.-A race war
has been started as the result of the
public whipping of three negroes, two
of them women, on the courthouse
steps Friday night. A committee of
the law and order league took three
negroes from their homes and whipped
them publicly for alleged misconduct
Since then the negroes and white peo
ple have been at swords point and it
is said twenty-five negro. families have
been frightened into leaving this vi
cinity.
The recent killing of Harry O'Don
nell, a reputable citizen, *as charged
to negroes and did much to stir up
enmity. The whites have openly
threatened to battle with the negroes
and drive them from Fayette.
The negro man who was whipped
Friday night made a .desperate resist
ance. It took several men to carry
him to the whipping post. He cursed
his captors az the lash was applied,
which resulted in the whip being wield
ed only the .more vigorously. When
the ordeal was ended the negro was
so weak from loss of blood that he was
put to bed instead of being driven from
town. The women, who were not whip
ped so severely, were taken to the out
skirts and told to go. There is much
excitement and a clash is feared.
After English Coal.
New York, Feb.,11.-After a lull in
buying, which was very marked during
January, America is again coming into
the English market for supplies of coal
and iron, according to a London' dis
patch to the Tribune. One firm of
London agents is said to have received
American inquiries for 100,000 to 500.
000 tons of coal, and shippers on this
side are now talking of sending coal
to the United States for the remainder
of the year. Ten steamers hive been
chartered within the last few days to
convey Cleveland iron across the At
lantic, and in consequence the iron
market is holding its own with con
siderable firmness.

news agency from Rome, says: King
Victor Emmanuel has conferred on
Signor Mascagni, the composer, the

The conferring of the title on Mas

that always makes cc' feel as if I wasq

What Tilden Lent.
When Mr. Tilden in 1874 was nomi
nated for governor of New York, Mr.
Dorsheimer received the nomination for
lieutenant governor. The ticket thus
headed was elected by about 30,000 ma
jority. A little knot of Germans in
New York city who usually voted the
Republican ticket took Mr. Dorsheinmer
from his name to be a German, and
they scratched their ticket in his favor.
so that lie had a majority of nearly 53.
000. One day after Mr. Tilden and Mr.
Dorsheinler had been inaugurated they
met at a political breakfast at the for
mer's house in (iGramercy park. Mr.
Tilden had always felt a little sore at
Mr. Dorsheimer's extra majority, and
so when in the current of conversation
Mr. I)orsheimer jestllgly said, "Well,
governor, you must remember I had
3,000 more majority than you." as quick
as a flash Mr. Tilden retorted, "Yes,
you supplied the 3,000, and I lent you
the fifty."
A Fine Piece of Work.
"I tell you," exclaimed the young
medical student, "our professor is an
eminent surgeon."
"How's that?" asked his chtum
"Well, a fellow was brought in with
a crushed leg. The professor said it
must come off. But by some means or
other he cut off the wrong leg."
"Do you call that a fine piece of sur
gery?'"
"Wait a bit.- The professor said it
would be terrible for the poor fellow
to go about with no legs at all, so he
splintered up the crushed leg instead
of cutting that off, too, and now it is as
good as ever. An ordinary surgeon
would have left the fellow legless.
Wonderful skill, the professor's!"
An Effective Threat.
A youth was engaged as junior clerk
by a firm of lawyers, and by way of
filling in his time and testing his worth
on his first day he was told to write
a letter demanding payment of a debt
from a client who was long In arrears.
To the great surprise of his employers
a check for the amou:it arrived the
next day. They sent for the young
clerk and asked him to produce a copy
of the letter which had had such an
astonishing result. The letter ran as
follows:
Dear Sir-If you do not at once remit
payment of the amount which you owe us,
we will take steps that will amaze you.

BALLOT MEASURE.
Vouse Commlnittce Reports Substitute for
Terrell's |ill.
Austin, Fcb. 11.-The house commit
tee on privileges, suflrage and elections
voted to report a substitute for the
election bills offered by Messrs. Ter
rell of Travis and Onion of Bexar. The
substitute in the main follows the pro
visions of Judge Terrell's bill. Instead
of a blanket ballot there will be one
for each party, and at expense of each
party.
Primary election expenses are to be
borne by each party holding them One
provision requires votes to participate
in primaries af the party with which
they declare they affiliate when paying
their poll tax.
No voting precinct shall contain
more than 250 voters, according to the
last vote for governor, except in cities,
where it shall be according to the vote
in the la-t city election. The tax col
lector shall have a poll tax receipt
book for each precinct.
To conform to the recent opinion of
the attorney general, persons offering
to pay county and state poll tax must
first produce receipts showing that they
have paid town or city poll tax, where
subject to such poll tax.
The provision relating to the pro
curing of certificates of exemption from
payment of poll tax is limited to cities
of more than 10,000 inhabitants.
Voters may require the particular
ballot they desire. otherwise they will
receive one copy of each ballot, select
and prepare the ballot they desire to
vote in a booth and the ballot so se
lected will be deposited in the count
ing box and the others in a blank box.
Provisions are made for guarding the
secrecy of all these ballots. It is pro
vided that there fnay be primaries for
special election as well as for general
elections. It is provided that in dis
tricts the blanket system shall prevail
where primaries are held, but there
may be conventions upon the call of
the district executive committees of
the respective parties.
In the house consideration of the bill
providing for a department of agri
culture as an Indepenrent institution
was deferred until the 17th.
Mr. O'Quinn secured consent to take
up bill relating to selling liquor to ha
bitual drunkards and the bill ° was
placed on its second reading.
Mr. Sanford offered an amendment
providing that the offense shall con
sist in selling liquor knowingly to an
habitual drunkard. Adopted.
Mr. Mays offered an amendment' mak
ing it an offense for a habitual drunk
ard to buy liquor and providing that
the bondsmen on the liquor dealers'
bonds should not be made liable for
violations of the provisions of the act.
Adopted.
Bill went to third reading.

Houston, Feb. 11.-Ella Koenig

CLOSELY GUARDED.
It Is Thought, However, an Increased
Demand Is Asked.
Washington, Feb. 11.-Although Mr.
Bowen and the other negotiators are
closely guarding the provisions of the
several protocols it is understood that
their demands which are known to ex
ist in the German and Italian agree
ments am they are at present drafted
to which Mr. Bowen can not agree, con
cern an increased payment by Vene
zuela prior to 'the handing down of The
Hague's decision regarding the allies
contention for preferental considera
tion in the settlement of their claims
It is reported that Germany asks that
she receive, in addition to the $27.500
cash that Mr. Bowen has agreed to
pay, a certain per centage of the cus
toms receipts until the remainder of
the $740,000 demanded in the original
ultimatum addressed by Germany to
President Castro last autumn is paid.
iItaly, it is believed is insisting on a
similar demand, though the amount
asked for in her ultimatum was over
$500,000. Both Germany and Italy sug
gest that this money be paid in month
ly installments out of the customs du
ties, but even under this arrangement
it would require eight months for the
payment of the entire sum:
It is the principle, however, to which
Mr. Bowen so streniously objects and
to which he has informed the German
and Italian envoys he can not sub
scribe. Until their protocols are re
lieved of these objectional demands Mr
Bowen says that they must remain un
signed. He contends that Germany
and Italy are insisting on preferential
treatment, a question which they agree
in their protocols shall go to The
Hague.

Assuming the Husband's Name.
The practice of the wife na- ":g
the husband's name at marria,,
nated from a Roman custom an
came the common custom after the ho
man occupation. Thus, Julia and Oc
tavia. married to Pompey and Cicero.
were called by the itomans Julia of
Pompey and Octavia of Cicero. and in
later times married women in most
European countries signed their names
in the same manner, but omitted the
''of."
Against this view it may be mention
ed that during the sixteenth and even
at the beginning of the seventeenth
century the usage seems doubtful,
since we find Catherine Parr so sign
ing herself after she had been twice
married, and we always hear of Lady
Jane Grey (not Dudley), Arabella
Stuart (not Seymour), etc. Some per
sons think that the custom originated
from the Scriptural teaching that hus
band and wife are one. This was the
rule of law so far back as Braetoa
(died 1268), and it was decided in the
case of Bon versus Smith, in the reign
of Elizabeth, that a woman by mar
riage loses her former name and legal
ly receives the name of her husband.
Altogether the custom is Involved in
much obscurity.
