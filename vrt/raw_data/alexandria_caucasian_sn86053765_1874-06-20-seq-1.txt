THE GRANGERS.
DE< ÎLAIÎ'ATÏON OF PURPOSES.
From the Constitution of llio Çafioual
(.range. ' • •
Profoundly impressed with the
truth, tIifU' Hie National Grange of
the United States should definitely
proclaim to the world its general
objects, we licrolrAnnanimotlsly,
imfkc this Declaration of Purposes
<>I the Patrons of Husbandry.
1. United by thostrongand faith
ful tie of Agriculture, we mutually
resolve to labor for the good of yur
order, our country rfnd mankind. B
0 2. We. heartily indorse tlio mot
to: "In essentials, unity; in non
essentials, liberty: in all things,
charity."*!
We shall endeavor to advance
our cause by laboring to accomplish
the. following Objects: To develop
a better and higher manhood and
womanhood among ourselves. To
enhance the comforts and attrac
tions <Tf our homes and strengthen
our attachments to our pursuits.
To foster mutual understanding
and co-operation. To maintain in
violate our laws, and to emulate
each other in labor to hasten the
good time coming. To reduce our
expenses, both individual and cor
porate. To buy less and product
more, in order to make our farms
sell'sustaining. To diversify our
crops, and crop no more than we
can cultivate. To condense the
weight of our exports, selling less
in the bushel and more on hoof anil
in fleece; !es.®in lint and more in
warp and woof. To sys irinatize
our work and'calculate intelligent
ly on probabilities.' To discounten
ance the credit system, the mort
gage system, the lashiou system,
and every other system tending to
prodigality and bankruptcy. We
propose meeting together, talking
together, and in general acting to
gether for oM-r mutual protection
and advancement, as occasion inav
require. We shall avoid litigation
as much as possible by arbitration
in the grange. We shall -constant,
ly strive to s» cm m'ont ire harmony,
good will, vital brotherhood among
ourselves, and to make our order
perpetual. Wo shall earnestly en
de!$or to suppress personal, local,
sectional and national prejudices,
all unhealthy ri va 1 l'y, all si@-;h am
bit ion. Faithful adhe. once to these
principles will insure our mental,
moral, social anil material advance
ment.
4. For our business interests, wi|i
desire t<>bri ng producers and con
sinners, Tanners and manufacturers
into the most direct iind friendly
relations possible. Hence, we must
dispense with a surplus of middle
men, not that we are unfriendly to
them, but We do not need® them.
Their surplus and their exactions
diminislrtuir profits.' Wo wage no
aggressive warfare against •any oth
er interests whatever. On the eon
tff'y, all our acts, and all our ef
forts, so far as* business is gmcorn
ed, are not only for the benefit o L
the producer and consumer, but al
so for .ill other interests that tend
to bring these two ] tart i es into
speedy and economical contact.
Hence we hold that transportation
companies of every kind are neces
sary to our success, that their in
tcrests are intimately connected
with our interests, and harmonious
action is-mutually advantageous;
keeping in view the first sentence
in our declaration of principles of
action that*" Individual happiness
depends upon general prosperity,"
we proclaim our settled conviction
that we cannot expect to help our
selves in any form (hat involves the
injury of'>.>thers. We shall, there
■fore, advocate for every State the
increase in every practical way, of
all facilities for transporting cheap
ly to the seaboard, or between homo
producers and-consumers, all the
productions of our country. We
adopt it as our fixed purpose to
"open out'the channcls'in nature's
great arteries that the life blood of
commerce, may flow freely." Wo
are not momies of railroads, navi
gable or irrigating canals, nor of
any Corporation that wfll advance,
our industrial interests, nor of any
laboring classes*. In our noble or
der there is no cpmmunistn, no
agntrianism. We are opposed to
such spirit and management of any
corporation or enterprise h s tends
to oppress the people and rob them
of-their just profits. We are not
enemies to capital, but we oppose
the tyranny of monopolies. We
long to see the antagonism between
capital and labor removed by com
mon consent, and by an enlighten
ed statesmanship worthy of the
nineteenth century. We arc op
posed to excessive salaries, high
rates of interest, ami exorbitant per
Cent. proIiis in trade. • 'fliey great
ly increase our burdcjis, and do not
bear a proper proportion to the
profits of producers. We desire
only self protection and the pro
feet ion of every true interest of our
land by legitimate* transactions,
\q 7
legitimate Vade, and - legitimate
profits.
We shall advance the ^iiitC of
Education among ourselves and for
our children, 1 by all just means with
in our power. We especially advo
cate for our agricultural and indus
trial colleges that practical agri
culture, domestic science, and all
the arts which adorn the home, be
taught in their course of study.
5. We emphatically a:.d sincere^
assert the oft repeated truth taught
in our organic law, that the grange,
national, Su%",^)r subordinate, is
not a political or party* organiza
tion. No grange, if true to ift ob
ligations, can discuss political oi i
reliyious questions, nor call politi
cal conventions, nor nominate can
didates, nor even discuss their mer
its in its meetings. Yet the priii*
eiples wo teach underlie all true
statesmanship, and, if ©properly
carried out, will tend-to purify the
whole political, atmosphere of our
country. For we seek the grea@)d
good to the greatest number. We
must always bear in mind that no
one by becoming a Patron of Hus
bandry gives up that inalienable
right and duty which belongs to
every American citizen, to take a
C\
proper interest in the politics of his
country. On" the contrary, it is
right forWery member to do all in
his power legitimacy to influence
for good the aetio'gfjf any political
par^- tr> whic|j ho belongs. It is
his duty to do all he can in his own
party to put down bribery, corrup
tion and trickery; to. see that none
but competent, faithful and honest
lnciij who will unflinchingly stand
by our industrial 0 interest, are nom
ateiî
'or all positions of trust;
^" ,<1 t<y ' 1,nvc oarri( 'd °»t the priuci
pie which should always character
ize every member, that Ihc office
should seek the mon, nnd not the mon
the office.
©
We acknowledge the broad pan-,
ciple that difference of opinion" is iro
crime* and hold-that " progress to
wards tftith is^iadö by differences
of opinion," while " the fault lies in
bitterness of controversy."© We de
sire a proper equality, equity and
fairness; protection for the weak,
restraint upon the strong ; hi short,
justly distributed burdens and just
ly. distributed" power. These are
\ mci iean ideas, the vCrv esse nee
of Aiwcriean indepehdencc, and to
advocate the contrary is unworthy
of tho sons and daughters of an
American republic. We cherish
the belief that sectionalism is, and
of right should be, dead and buried
with the past. Our work is for the
present and the future. In our ^ig
ficultural brotherhood.and its pur
posed we shall recognize no North,
no South, up East, no West.
; It is reserved by. every patron, as
the right of a freeman, to affiliate
»with any party, that will best carry
out his' principles.
• fi. Ours being peculiarly a f'*r-"
mot's institution, we cannot admit
all to onr ranks. Many arc exclu
ded by the nature of our organiza
tion, not because they . arc profes
sional men, or artisans or laborers,
•but because they have not a suffi
cient direct interest in tilling or
pasturing the soil, * or may have
some interest iiPoonflicfc with our
purposes, lint' we appeal to all
good citizens for their cordial co^
operation to assist in our efforts to
wards reform, that»we may even
tually remove from our utids? the
last vestige of tyranny and corrup
tion. We had the general desire
for fraternal harmony, equitable
compromises, and earnest co opéra
tion, as an omen of our future sin;
cess.
7..It shall be an abiding princi
ple with us to relievo any of our
oppressed and suffering brother
hood l>y any means nt^ qih 1 com
mand. Last, but not least, we pro
claim it among out purposes- to in
cfilcate a proper appreciation of the
Qbilities and spheres of woman, as
is indicated by admiring lier to
membership alul position in our or
der. ^nploring the continued as
sistance Of our Divine Master to
guide us in our work, we here
pledge ourselves to faithful and
harmonious labor for all future
time, to return by our united efforts
to the wisdom, justice, fraternity
and 0 political purity of our fore
fathers. ©

The Verdict.
About 7 o'clock Wednesday even
ing tho jury, in the Grant parish
ease gave notice that they had fin
ally agreed upon a verdick, and de
sired to hand it in. Notice was at
once sent to thcrDistriet Attorney,
Judge Woods and the counsel for
the defense, Messrs. WhUakcr, E.
John Ellis and^i. II. Marr.
@ THE PRISONERS.
A^ 8 o'clock the prisoners were
brought into court, being literally
taken from their beds. They were,
all looking in very bad condition;
the heat and unhealthincss of their
cells in the Parish Prison, the ner
vous suffering during tilt) long trial
that has been going on, scented
have broken them down, entirely, j
Threeof the prisoners .were very'all
sick.indeed—Ptudhomine Lemoine, ;
suffering from cold; Johnny Had-j
noi®who was afflicted with a severe
chill, and Tom Hickman, who was'
seriously if not dangerously ill with :
the fever, the result of nervousness J
and imprisonnieiR. The latter two 1
prisoners were brought to the'eourt
in a carriage. • •
At the time Judge Woods arriv
ed there were very tew persons in
the court room only about a dozen
or so, who had accidently heard |
that a verdict was expected. The
prisoners were naturally nervous !
over the coming verdict, although
they showed it but slightly. Conn- '
sol for defense were somewhat des
pondent; they had not the slightest
idea what the verdict was to be and
seemed to have very gloomy antic
ipations.
A VERDICT.
At about half past H o'clock the
juf-y walked solemnly intocrturt and
took- their seatffj they seemed no
more ato-aso than tho prisoners—
and looked around tho room, una
ble to fix their eyes on tho priso
ners, or indeed on anybody.
At Judge WooHs'question, "Gen
tleman, have you agreed upon a
verdict V' Mr. JMelvec stopped for
.ward and stud:
"Your, honor, wo h live brought
in a qualified verdict, which.*wc
have written" out; I«will read it.
But Mr. McKee apparently "could
not read the verdict, lie was too
nervous to do so, and finally turned
the"papers over to Mr. Carey, who
read off the following as "the ver
dict :
•GUlfiTV.
William J. ('ruikshatVk, "William
Irwin"and John P. Iladnot, guilty
on the first sixteen counts, and re
commended . to tjio mercy of the
court; not guilty on tlie last sixteen'
conuts. . . .
Austin E. Gibbons, Prudhomme
Lemolne, Dennis Lemoine, Thomas
Hickman . and Clement renn, not
guilty. • «
the .tur
The jury was -Pion polled. All tlie
jurors—Alex. McKee, foreman; Jno
^lulrey, Tim Kelly, Joe. Dastingue
John G. Gantr® George D. Rede,
Charles Bonhomme, Florvillo Foy,
Jabob Wolf, Ii. S. Carey, Sydney
lîrnny aiul John R. Shields answer
ing that this was their verdict.
A NEW INDICTMENT,
^hc District Attorney njoved that
the prisoners", found guilty or not
guilty, bo at once reinaiKled to
prison, as there was still another
indictment against them, charging
them with a conspiracy against and
murder of Win. Williams, another
negrockilled in the Colfax fight.
THE JURY ROOM.
The jurors, when questioned, de
clined to tell much about tho man
lier, in which tliey had stood "at
first, affirming that they had agreed
among themselves to keep it pri
vate. It was, lioweveP, ascertained
that when they first went out to
consider over tlie case, there was
great difference of opinion about
every fact and every, prisoner. The
matter was talked over for two days,
Concessions being .made on lioth
sides, unt:l yesterday .morning the
jury stood for the present verdict—
ten in favor* and two opposed to
any verdict of guilty. At 0 o'«lock
these two gave in, and the. verdict
was framed. ... o
PUNISHMENT.
o
According to this verdict
©ic
three prisoners are found gt ilf'y un
der sixteen counts, ofxonspiring
and banding together to prevent
the peaceable assemblage of the ne
tojgroes, to prevent their voting, bear
ing arms and goueifilly taking away
their rights. Tho last «ix teen
counts in which the prisoners are
charged with murdering Alex. Til
man and Leo Allen; whilpt thus
conspiring, they arc "found guilty
on.
The punishment for tlie $fense
of \Vhich tliey are fourni' guilty is
fine and imprisonment at hard labor;
the imprisonment not to exceed ten
years,*or the fine of $1000.
Of the three prisoners found
guilty, "Win". Cruikshank is a native
of this Slate, aged öl, with a wife
and large family; John Had not, a
native ot Texas, oaged 19, married,
and a father; and Will fan Irwin, a
native of Alabama, aged about 33,
and having a family.
The defense admitted that two
of these were in the fight. Hadnot
and Irwin. On the part of Cruik
sliauk, it wj'.s shyu u that lie had eu
tered Colfax af ter the Court House
was burned to save a negro's lifo
and had left immediately. Tho
other prisoners all proved alibis.
ARREST Of JUDGMENT.
Justice Bradley, of the Supremo
Court, ha» promised to return to
tho city and in consultation with
Judge Woods liear a motion in ar
rest of jndgmont, testing the juris
diction of tho United States Court
and the-constitntionality of the Ku
KlnX-aot, so that this question cau
reach tho Supreme Court.
As to the -other prisoners they
will undoubtedly be released to-day
either on baifuiider the new indict
ment against them or this indict
nient will be quashed, is being word
tor word and letter for letter tho
same as that of which tbey have,
been found not guilty, with tho sin
pie substitution of Win. Williams
for Alex. Tillman as,tho victim.
An 015, Old Story. •
A thousand times the old story
has been told through the press
and whispered in society, and still
the lesson is not learned. A young
lady, iust of tho school-room, is fas
inated by the attentions of a man
of the would, and nothing can per
suade her that he is'not the noblest,
the bravest,, the best of lovers.
©
WJiat does she know, i>oor thing—
of the secret; lives of these gdllant
gentlemen ? She reads the legend
of excess and evil courses written
'on the bleared eyo and the tremu
lous lip,, and she can not under
stand it. She hears a whisper, per
haps, of scandalous prodigality and
indulgence,.and she stops her littlo
ears and loves her hero all tho bet
ter as the victim of detraction.
She knows nothing of his previous
history, nothing of his daily occu
pations, nothing of his associates.
She little imagines that his soft
compliments tönceal a cruel temper,
and the hand which presses hcr's so
tenderly is a brutal hand, tit only
for deeds ot violence.- That ho is a
gambler and a drunkard, false,
quarrelsome, idk*. selfish and sen
sual; that lie is at war with Ihs pa
rents, and a tyrant in the.company
ot women, she might learn, if®îdio
would exercise as "much caution in
choosing u husband as in choosing
a bonnet. But young -women liavo
a dim notion that it is grand and.
noblo to take, a lover 011 trust, to
despise good connsePand filial obe
dience, an'd othey ling -themselves
with the" syycet delusion that they
are heroines when fhey are only
fools.
The girl triumphs, of course, over
father and mother. Those who
really Jove her follow tho wedding
festivities with aching hearts—and
watch fhe future with sorrowful ap
prehension. The inoxydable sequel
is not long delayed. For a few
shot t weeks life is a dream of so It,
-sentiment and new gowns. Then
the'truth"begins todawnlipou the
poor little heart. She has sold Im 1
self for ;i passing fancy. Neglect,,
is soon followed by angry words
and contemptuous looks, and bru
tal jests. The gallant gentleman
goes out, cursing in the morning and
comes home reeling at night. lier
.jewels are sold to buy bread, and
he steals the money to spend it for
drink. There i.f a hideous hruiso
on tlK! white neck of which he used
to say such pretty things. Sho
shudders at the footstep for which
hhe once listened with rapture. Sho
hides herself in terror from tho face
upon which she thought® she could
gaze forever. Sometimes, with tho
courage which-seems to be only giv
en to certain women, sIk ) holds a,
proud and smiling face to the world,
hides the brutalities of her master,
covers up her hardship, dissembles
hunger, and no one knows, except
the husband, when she rests at last
from her sorrows, that, the brave
heart was broken in the first months
after marriage. Sometimes the sad
story ends in that common ctirso
and punishment of American mar
riages, a legal separation, and soma
times in the one catastrophe which
is worse than divorce -in murder.
