—although its bid was highest and it was not
entitled to any.
Now, the Steel Trust says to the Govern
ment, “Give me more, or I will leave you to
the mercy of the Midvale Company.”
Inasmuch as the Steel Trust has always
succeeded in getting what it wanted from the
Government, it will probably be placated this
time, as upon other occasions. But think of
it, Hobson—think of it!
