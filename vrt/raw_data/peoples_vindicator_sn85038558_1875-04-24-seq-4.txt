WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion Aamecrican Comic Pl'per !
tIllustra ted by a corps of the best Ameri
r can arlists, andl contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
t. the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfiully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
t monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social slhamn by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater sucCess than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
l~ave yielded still further to the public
i demand, and now publish Wild Oats
i weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
SIn its literary departmeuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial,.tory will always be found in its
page;, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERS V" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient 'recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
- Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of YIs
EOAR BrTTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The propertles of DR. WALK
RU's VINEGAR -BITTRas are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa

out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka

heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose
