AN OLD SOLDIER INDIGNANT.
I found the accompanying article
in a copy of the Atlanta Semi-Week
ly Journal of March 26th:
“Keep out of temptation. Avoid
all appearance of evil. Don’t take
any chances. Don’t see or talk to
any women alone.”
I think that when a man dedicates
his life to the service of “God,” that
he should be too well protected by
his cloak of sanctity to need any ad
vice to keep out of the way of temp
tation, unless like the author of the
inclosed article, he mistook the di
rection from whence the call came;
in which case the advice to keep out
of temptation would not be heeded.
I cannot imagine where Mr. Bar
ton gathered his data regarding the
danger of being associated with wom
en. He may have been a missionary
in the wilds of Africa, and fell a vic
tim to the fascinations of the ladies
of the jungle; else he has not been
over choice in the class of society
from which he selected his associates,
otherwise he could not possibly have
drawn his diabolical inference re
garding the general morality, or rath
>er (from his standpoint) the immor
tality of women. In my boyhood
days I was taught that associating
with good women was the surest way
of developing every atom of refine
ment in a young man’s make-up. I
have lived in different parts of North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida and Tennessee, and have had
many acquaintances among ladies
from almost every part of the United
States, as well as from the British
Isles, Scandinavian countries and
from many nations of Continental
Europe. Though Ido not claim that
all those with whom I have been as
sociated will reach the standard of
“Royal Baking Powder,” I think that
they will average like “Ivory Soap,”
99 and 44-100, which, like the “Old
time religion, is good enough for
me.”
It is enough to make any man boil
with indignation to read such a dam
nable article in reference to women.
I do not write this with a view of
seeing my name in print. I am an
old Confederate soldier from South
Carolina. I came to Georgia at too
late a period to be benefited by the
pension law. Have been badly af
flicted for years, am scarcely able to
write, but I could not let an article
like the inclosed go unchallenged.

Two Great Reforms
By Elbert Hubbard
DURING the past six months I
have traveled through twenty
nine States and given one hun
dred public addresses in various
towns and cities.
This has given me a pretty fair op
portunity to feel the public pulse.
My opinion is that there are at
least two great questions of public
policy that are working themselves
out toward a speedy solution.
One of these is the question of
woman suffrage, and the other is the

abolition of the saloon or open bar.
The opposition to woman suffrage
comes from two sources and is of two
kinds. The first reason why men op
pose equal suffrage is the desire of
the male animal, man, to hold wom
en as a domestic animal.
Woman was man’s first property
right.
She belongs first to her father,
then to her husband. “Who gives
this woman away?” asks the priest
in solemn tones. And even in case
of a widow of discreet years, some
male man has to step forward and
pose as her owner.
The free woman, the independent
woman, has been regarded with sus
picion until day before yesterday.
Like the Indian, she is a sort of ward
of the State, a mental and moral de-
The Doves of Thought
' By Frank E. Anderson
Tho' Thou art inhere the sun’s first roses blush
As, thro' the skies, he drives his plowshare bright,
And I, where last his tired horses rush
To water in the tideless stream of night;
Tho' envious miles, which knew my love for Thee,
Took life to thrust our bodies far apart,
At dusk my thoughts, like carrier-doves set free,
On wings of music seek their home; Thy heart.
On! For their master's sake each rosy beak
Warm Thou with kisses, as they seek their nest;
Oh! Shyly then soft words of welcome speak,
Nor bar the snowy lattice of thy breast;
Oh! Drive them not once more into the gloom,
On drooping pinions to return to me
To tell how they—denied their former room—
Another's thoughts usurping there did see!
fective, unable an dunfit to express
her preferences. She is not a citizen.
Men give a good many reasons why
women should not vote, but all of
these reasons resolve themselves,
with one exception, back to this —the
lust for undisputed power on the
part of the man.
The exception is a financial one.
Every mother hates the saloon;
every potential mother hates the sa
loon. The saloon is the rival of the
home.
The men engaged in the traffic of
strong drink oppose woman suffrage
because they know that if woman
had the power to vote her ballot
would always and forever be cast
against the saloon. Even the wives
and daughters of saloon keepers
usually look forward to a time when
the husband and father can get into
a better business.
This sentiment against the saloon
keeper finds form in a peculiar way.
Most Elk lodges now refuse to accept
a saloon keeper as a member. The
Honorable Elk isn’t exactly a Puri
tan in his method of thought, but as
a citizen he is opposed to the open
bar as a matter of civic expediency.
Violence, disorder, “gun play,” cen
ter around the saloon, if anywhere.
I5l)e. TJaffcrsonian
In talking to an exalted ruler of an
Elk lodge the other day, he met my
suggestion that the saloon was the
poor man’s club by the flat assertion
that no poor man had a right to
strong drink of any sort. He argued
that liquor was a luxury, and where
women might have to go without de
cent clothing and children might suf
fer for bf'ead, the husband and father
who spent a part of his wages for
drink w’as a rogue and a criminal.
Yet this man hadn’t a particle of
sympathy with prohibition as a great
ethical or semi-religious movement.
There was a “buffet” attached to his
lodge, but his argument was that the
men who patronized his buffet had
earned the right to do so, because
they were men of means and men
who had shown the ability to control
their appetites and affairs.
That the woman who is a wife and
mother regards the saloon as a rival
and an enemy is absolutely beyond
cavil. A woman may have very lit
tle intellect and small education, but
the thought that her husband or son
may become a drunkard causes the
hot flush of resentment to leap to her
cheek. Beyond this is the plain
struggle for existence.
Her living comes through her hus
band’s wages. She has no other
source of income. A part of his in
come is hers, for her own needs and
those of her children.
Here you awaken an elemental in
stinct—you are taking food from her
young! The tigress in her nature is
aroused! Do you think that any sa
loon Interest can buy her vote? Nev
er. She hates the saloon keeper as a
peccary hates a bear. Even if the
saloon has not stolen her child it has
stolen the boys of other mothers.
Every mother knows all about these
tragedies.
Also, the liquor interests know
that every mother knows. And that
is why the full strength of the “sa
loon vote” is against woman suffrage.
Men of intelligence know that the
advent of women into evrey branch
of life has tended to refine, beautify
and benefit it.
Men separated from women are
rogues; women separated from men
are silly.
In order to secure the highest de
gree of progress men need the help of
women, and the ballot will increase
the mental resources of women. It
cannot be disputed that woman is
just as much interested in good gov
ernment as men. In very truth, she
has more at stake. In times of war
women are the real sufferers. Ask
the little brown women of the Phil
ippines?
The increasing number of women
employed in offices and factories de
mands that women shall have a vote
in the laws made to protect the in
terests of women and children.
The “saloon talk” is always and
forever opposed to woman suffrage.
One of the reasons heard in such
places is that women cannot bear
arms. Women, however, bear chil
dren, and this is quite as great a ser
vice to the State as shouldering a
musket. One is a necessity, the oth
er may be. The hope of the world
lies in creation, not in the ability to
destroy; it lies in education, not in
violence; it lies in love, not in hate.
In voicing sentiments of this char
acter I find always a hearty response,
which proves that the thought is not
new. The people are becoming
aroused.
Justice, expediency and common
sense demand that women shall have
an equal voice with men in the mak
ing of laws that govern both. Men
have no more right to make law’s for
the control of women than women
have for men. Taxation without rep
resentation is tyranny.
As long as the State has a right to
hang a woman and tax a woman, she
surely should have her preferences
recorded as to how she shall be
hanged and how she shall be taxed.

It is a proverbial saying among
all women that husbands have no
adequate idea of the work which a
housekeeper must do, and conse
quently are careless of the extra
work they make for her. Would this
be so in the next generation if every
mother would begin with her little
boys and teach them to be orderly
with all their belongings, and to wait
on themselves? Not only this, but
teach them to help mother in every
possible w r ay; to keep the w’ood box
filled with wood and water pail with
water; to save mother’s tired feet by
going upstairs and dowui cellar for
her? Let him put up the clothes
line, turn the wringer and empty the
tubs for her on wash-day as soon as
he is old enough. He will be proud
enough to think that he is growing
strong enough to do these things bet
ter than mother. Be very sure that
you show your appreciation of every
helpful act, and let him see that you
look to him for assistance.—-Dodson
