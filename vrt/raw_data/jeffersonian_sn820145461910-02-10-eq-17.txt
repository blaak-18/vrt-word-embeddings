NO. 8605—A SIMPLE, EFFECTIVE
MODEL.
Women realize the importance of
having a house dress that is adapted
to its purpose, is simple in design,
and comfortable. We submit in the
design here shown a model that is
practical and that will prove desira
ble and suitable. The waist may be
developed with center front plain
closing, or with the extension as il
lustrated. The skirt has the new
back panel effect and closes at the
centei* front. This practical feature
will appeal to every homeworker and
laundress, as it renders the ironing
of the dress easy. The sleeves may
be made in elbow length or in wrist
length. The pattern is cut in 7 sizes:
3 2-34-36-38-40-42 and 44 inches,
bust measure, and requires 6 yards
of 36-inch material for the 36-inch
size.
A pattern of this illustration sent
to any address on receipt of 10 cents
in stamps or silver. Address

Two Letters From China
Dallas, Tex., Nov. 26, 1900.—First
Sergeant Chas. Famel, Company I,
Fourteenth United States Infantry,
writing to Captain Tom Meyers, of
the Dallas Fire Department, from
Pekin, China, under date of October
1, says:
“After occupying the capital of
the Chinese Empire, we are ready to
start back to our old stamping
ground, the Phillipine Islands. This
country is not fit for white people to
live in, and we soldiers can’t see why
in thunder that band of so-called
missionaries don’t stay at home and
mind their own business instead of
coming here and bringing the whole
world into a bloody war.
“When a boy my mother used to
take me to church on Sunday and
never neglected to give me a penny
to drop in the missionary box. I see
the fruits of it now.”
After writing two thousand words
of his experiences and observations
in China, Sergeant Famel closes his
letter (after giving the Phillipine
Islands a good “cussing”) as follows:
“But we are starting again; desti
nation, Manilla. I wish the United
States would sell the islands and let
those ‘niggers’ do as they please. I
am inclined to believe that we will
be fighting there twenty years from
now if we keep them.”
Sergeant Famel says his company
lost forty men, killed or from dis
ease, after reaching China.—St.
Louis Republic.
The following letter from Mr. C.
W. Griggs, who was reared near
Boyce, now in the United States
army at Pekin, China, is given
space at his request. His stories of
the actions of missionaries in that
country appears overdrawn, and it is
hard to believe it true, yet it is from
an eyewitness whom we know to be
of good character, and his statement
is given for what it is worth.
The letter is as follows:
Pekin, China, Sept. 6.—Mr. and
Mrs. J. B. Griggs—Dear father and
mother: As I have nothing else to
do today I will write to you. This
leaves me well. One thing I want to
tell you about is the missionaries in
China. They are a fake and no
“bloody good.” You probably recol
lect how they made up purses for the
poor, suffering missionaries in China,
and no doubt you have given money
to them. I would like to insult any
person who would ask me for one
lousy penny for them. Upon my
life I never was in as fine a house
as a China mission. And as to them
Christianizing the Chinese they need
to be civilized themselves. They all
have from twenty to thirty Chinese
slaves working for them and if the
poor beggar disobeys he is strapped
down and a cow’hide is applied by
two strong bucks. That is how they
civilize and educate the heathen
Chinee.
After fighting our way from Tien
Tsin, a distance of 120 miles, and
losing half of our comrades to re
lieve the poor, suffering missionaries
from being tortured by the heathen
Chinese Boxers, our welcome from
the women missionaries was a snarl
of the nose and they would turn
their backs and say: “You dirty
looking pups,” for we were as dirty
as pups, after wallowing in muddy
trenches, and sleeping in mud and

dirt. Ask a drink of water, we would
have to drink from a cup as you
would make a negro do. And when
we went into camp and brought in
our wounded comrades from the
battlefield they did not come near
nor offer any assistance whatever.
One had the gifted nerve to say they
had to do without milk and butter
two days while we poor beggars had
not had anything to eat for two days
or more. I want you to show this to
everybody, for I want them to know
the truth of the poor, suffering mis
sionaries who are trying to civilize
the heathen Chinese. I have written
the truth, the whole truth, and noth
ing but the truth, so help me God.
So good-bye, and may you never be
sent as a missionary to any heathen
country.
Respectfully,
C. W. GRIGGS,
Co. H, 14th Infantry.

‘‘THE DEATH OF COMRADE JOHN
H. CLAXTON.”
To the Officers and Members of Dr.
G. M. McDowell Camp No. 1710:
Whereas death has entered our
ranks and removed from our midst
our esteemed friend and comrade, a
true friend, a wise counsellor, an up
right friend and faithful soldier.
Mr. Claxton went into the army from
Eufaula, Alabama, with Captain
Henry Woods’ battery, and served in
that battery till the close of the War.
When peace came, the war with Mr.
Claxton was over; and from that
time till the close of his life every
talent and power he possessed was
exerted for the upbuilding of the
South, the country he so much loved,
by the promotion of those policies
and practices that make a section or
nation great.
He was a conscientious man, he
strove to be right; having carefully
weighed a proposition, he formed an
