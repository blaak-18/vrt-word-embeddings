AS TO OUR “SOCIAL EQUALITY”
PRESIDENTS.
Dear Sir:—l am now near seventy
years old and have been reading after
you for six or eight years. I have
always been a Democrat; I may still
be, but with your truthfulness and
your honor I shall die a Watson man.
Why? Because you have come forth
without fear of men and have told
our people what I think is the truth.
Some years ago Mr. Roosevelt, our
ex-President, dined Booker Washing
ton at the White House, and you
came out and said that was no more
than Grover Cleveland had done. So
Mr. Watson I put a black eye on that
at that time, but Mr. Watson I now
believe you told the truth. If I have
misconstrued any part of the above I
ask you to correct the same, for I
am willing to leave iny fate with
you. There is no man living whom
I appreciate as a statesman more
than Ido you. I honestly believe all
you say. I beg to be one who be
lieves in honor and virtue and truth
fulness. I am
Yours very respectfully,
C. D. WOODURD.
Cochran, Georgia.
Answer.
The foregoing letter is very much
appreciated. Our old friend, how
ever, is a little bit in error as to the
facts. Mr. Roosevelt was holding a
conference with Booker Washington
at the White House when his lunch
eon was brought in, as usual, on a
tray. On the impulse of the mo
ment, Mr. Roosevelt invited Wash
ington to share this informal meal.
Mrs. Roosevelt was not present, nor
were any of the ladies of the Presi
dent’s household.
I did not say that Mr. Cleveland
dined with Fred Douglas; but did say
that this mulatto, and his white wife,
were invited by Mr. Cleveland, in a
personal note, to attend his bridal
reception at the White House on re
turning from his bridal tour. This
was not a state function at all, but
was purely social; therefore Mr.
Cleveland’s invitation to Fred Doug
las and wife was not only an act of
social equality , but a tacit approval
of marriages between whites and
blacks.
I was told, however, that Mr.
Cleveland was one of the guests at
a dinner which Mr. Carnegie gave to
Booker Washington in New York.
An Atlanta negro wrote me that he
had this from Booker Washington’s
private secretary. Booker, though,
Is a cunning coon; and when I wrote
to his secretary, Emmett Scott, to get
a written confirmation of what the
Atlanta negro had communicated to
me, Booker promptly clapped the lid
on.

THE TAX BURDEN RESTS ON THE
FARMER.
Dear Sir:—l will write you a few
lines to ask a question.
Mr. Watson, is it lawful to make a
man pay taxes on corn he has eaten,
and pay taxes on dogs? I had to
give in mine. Will you kindly an
swer this in your Jeff, or write a
letter? I take The Jeff and think it
is a great paper.
Yours very truly,
Oliver, Ga. J. L. OLIVER.
P. S. —I live in Effingham County.
Answer.
(1) Under our present system, it
is the law to pay taxes on property
of every kind owned on the day fixed
by the Comptroller General. It
seems a great hardship to compel
people to pay on foodstuffs held for
consumption. I doubt if any manu
facturing establishment, throughout
the length and breadth of this land,
ever pays taxes on the products of
the mill. Poor old farmer, he catch
es it on all sides!
(2) Yes, the last Legislature im
posed a tax on dogs. It was thought
that this would be a good way of
getting rid of worthless curs, and
especially of the breed known as the
“nigger dog”. Stray dogs really re
vert to the wolf type, and become
very dangerous. Collected in droves,
they will attack almost anything, fre
quently killing children. However,
if the people generally are opposed
to the law, they should make their
wishes felt, for the majority has a
right to rule.
JASPER COUNTY NEVER WAS A
POPULIST STRONGHOLD.
Dear Sir: —Please advise me if
there are at least one dozen Populists
in Jasper County. One little cashier
of a bank says there are not that
many up there. You can answer
through The Jeff or private letter.
Yours for the fight,
Adrian, Ga. J. L. JAMES.
Answer.
The Pops were never strong in
Jasper County, though I think we
had more of a sprinkling there than
the bank cashier accredits to us.
The Jeffersonians have a greater
number of subscribers in that county
than the cashier mentions; and,
usually, a subscriber to The Jeffer
sonians means a man who believes
in our principles, whether he calls
himself by our name, or not. The
principles are the important things,
not the name.
There are a great many more na
tional bankers, and cashiers of na
tional banks, who read The Jeffer
sonians, and pay their coin regularly
to have their subscriptions renewed,
than you could possibly imagine.
These gentlemen know perfectly
well that, while I denounce the sys
tem, I have nothing unkind to say of
the individuals who, while the sys
tem is legal, adopt that line of busi
ness. T. E. W.
PLEASED WITH SHEARS.
Dear Sir:—l received the shears.
Many thanks for them. I was more
than delighted with them, and I think
you are entitled to more than the
dollar for my renewal to the Maga
zine, so I will send you twenty-five
cents worth of stamps . I hope you
can use them all right. lam as ever,

APPROVES OF THE JEFFS ON
PUBLIC MATTERS.
Dear Sir:—While at the State
Farm at Macon, last October, I met
Mr. J. J. Brown, who asked me to
take your paper for three months. I
did so, and have been much interest
ed in your writings. I approve of the
positions you take on all public mat
ters, and am so much interested in
the paper that I never lay one down
until I have read everything in it
to the last advertisement. I have
been laid up for the last month with
rheumatism, or I should have sent in
renewal before now. Let the paper
continue to come and send me a few
copies of both Jeffs, and I will try to
get a few subscribers to send in with
my renewal J. L. RYAN.

CAN’T DO WITHOUT THE JEF
FERSONIAN.
Dear Sir: —As our time is about
up we hasten to renew, as we can’t
get along without your paper. It is
one of the best papers that goes
through the mails. I have watched
closely after you ever since the 90’s,
and you have stood firm, not waver
ing, when all the rest of the reform
ers went down before the slush fund.
Oh! the money that you could have
piled up if you had been for sale. But,
thank God, there is something with
in you that is worth more than gold.
I am a Methodist, but I am with you
on missions, and the way you handle
those parsons is a plenty. What Will
become of Wakefield and his like?
May God speed you in your work.
Believe me, I am your friend,
J. P. FORRESTER.
THE BIRTH OF MODERN MIS
SIONARY METHODS.
My Dear Sir:—l have been read
ing your series of articles on Foreign
Missions with some degree of inter
est. I am indeed glad that one of
your reputation has dared to beard
this missionary lion in his den.
The Primitive Baptists have al
ways held to the sentiments express
ed in your articles on this subject.
But they rejoice to know that others
are beginning to open their eyes to
“facts and figures.” I feel quite sure
that good will come of your persist
ent effort to expose to public gaze
the rottenness of this modern mis
sion craze.
Let us ask ourselves this impor
tant question: When, and by whom,
was this modern mission enterprise
instigated? Listen! For seventeen
hundred and ninety-two years such
an organization was absolutely un
known among the Baptists. In Octo
ber, 179 2, through the influence of
two preachers—Andrew Fuller and
William Carey—the first society for
“propagating the gospel among the
heathen” was organized in the PAR
LOR of Mrs. Beebe Wallis, in Kitter
ing, England. Thus the Missionary
Baby was born. It had a far more
noble place for its birth than our
Savior had; He was born in a man
ger, but modern missionism was born
in a PARLOR; not in the land of
Palestine, but in England; not in
Jerusalem, but in Kittering; not of
heavenly parentage, but of human.
For quite a while after its birth,
no doubt, the “Little Urchin” was,
apparently, a very innocent and
harmless creature. But since cross
ing “the line of accountability” the
“Little One” has developed, physi
cally, with such rapidity as to place
it on the list with its ancient prede
cessor, Mrs. Babylon, or Papal Rome.
This is the “Little One”, innocent
(?) though it was, that proved to be
the wedge that severed the “New
School” Baptists from the “Old

The spirit of fairness you mani
fest in giving both sides a hearing is
commendable indeed. May you live
long to rebuke this “Spiritual wick
edness in high places.”

VIEW OF THE GROWING DE-
MAND FOR THE JEFFS—AND
AN INVITATION.
My Dear Mr. Watson: —I admit
our presumption. And when your
reply has been received, I feel that I
have a right now to anticipate the
“just as I expected.”
Is it possible for you to deliver
our Commencement address on May
23? Your coming would help us.
We feel sure that you would go away
our friend.
As a suggestion of the reception
you would receive, this incident only
casts a shadow before: We get the
Jeffersonian. It came on Sunday,
and was lost on the same day. Two
stores handle the Magazine. We
sent on Monday evening for a copy,
and found every copy had been sold.
We then sent to the trains to get a
copy from the “News Butchers”, but
have not yet secured a copy. At
every place the response came, “Sold
out”. This change has come about
within a year. Before that time the
dealers complained that the sales
were slow.
Your coming would be a great oc
casion for us, and Ido not believeyou
would have occasion to regret com
ing. We feel brave for having asked
you to come. We know you are
busy. “Horatius at the Bridge”,
could know nothing of your fight
were he living today.
But —it is the people at home that
you would first help, and are help
ing—we have exhibited our cheek,
and will hope until w r e hear from
you.
Very Respectfully,
J. W. COLLUM,
Principal 3d Dist. Agric’l School.

HERE THEY COaME!
Dear Mr. Watson: —You said if the
people were with you, you could do
something.
Here are the people in this neck
of woods, all with you, so, let ’em
have it on both sides.
Yours truly, A. T. JACOBS.

BEN GRIFFIN DEFEATED.
Dear Sir:—We had a hard fight
here in the primary, but we lost our
man for Congress, B. J. Griffin, by
about 2,000 majority. It looks like
the people never will get their eyes
open. This was the first time the peo
ple have had a chance to elect a man
that would do the people any good in
some time. Thought the people had
begun to wake up, but they let a lit
tle slick-tongued lawyer pull them.
Mr. Watson, I wish you would
write some more on “Judgment Sent
from on High”, nearly everybody in
these parts believe that there is a
judgment sent from on high.
