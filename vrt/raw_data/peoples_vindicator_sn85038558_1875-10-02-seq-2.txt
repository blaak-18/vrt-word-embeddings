he got away with that $30,000 in

be much more interesting to our

handle it better, as he knows how

A Question of Importance,
When speaking of railroads and
the attendant taxation, to pay in part
for tlheir construction, the Natehito
clhs Rela?, liran, grows suddenly vir
tutons, and decants against this wan
ton outlay of the "people's money,"
alnd begs most piteously, that they
will not he asked to incrlease their
"already bnrdensome taxation."
Our reiaders will pardon our calling
their nttention to tihe fact, that the
'' 1umrdens,r" so feelingly complained
of, are part and parcel of the remains
of the legislation of such Police Ju
ries, as the Re|publicanl party, in its
wisdom (?), sa5w fit to afflict this ioor,
pa:rish wtlh; such bodies as were
proesided over by Blaekstone, the ale
parlted, that "burdened" the taxpayer
with debts at the rate (of :4,Pt), for
p:laupers alone, for each month, or
fifty-seven thousanid six hundred dol
laIs per year; payirng twenty dollars
per month to the indigent poor, to
the number of 240, when hlonst rep
resentative Juries fail to find sirfen ;
besides, every swindling operation
that could he started, met the ready
consideration of those bodies, and the
"usual" appropriation was voted to
such as Immigration bureaus, Gralnd
Ecore toll roads, Bridge contracts,
&c., &c.
Did tile Nat'hitoches ?Replblican
put uip a virtuous "lip" when the tax
payers in their might struggled under
the eight per cent taxes ? When they
met and forced off the incubus that
was grinding them to the dust, did
the 1 epubliaeun raise its voice in fivor
of the people ? No! a thpusashd times,
No ! We defy a perusal of its col
umns to prove, what we say. While
the very vitals of the people were
being eat out by that "burdensome
taxation," it stood by and openly de
fended the TAXER ; not one word of
sympathy for the TAXEI; not one
word of protest against acts they knew
to be criminal, but it spent its hours
in talking "peace," and clhopping
logic.
We can assure the Republican anod
its editor, whoever lie is, that the
people of Natchitoches who pay taxes,
have not yet forgotten the coarse of
that Journal, and they "well know
whom it represents. Besides, the
smack of communisom that has been
indulged in by the Organ ; its cry of
down with the "aristocrat," and the
miserable truckling to what it calls
the "p-o-o-r m a-n," will hardly finad
favor with the intelligent masses,
however much it may serve the par
pose for which it is undoubtedly in
tended, of arraying the negro against
the white man.
Let this diabolical doctrine; a doe
trine in direct antipathy to civiliza
tion, and iu direct conflict with the
spirit of time age; int once be fncul
cated in the negro, and with his teach
ings of hate already learned too well
from tihe Republicans' cl:ss, we must
bid farewell to peace and prosperity.
Thie issue will then be unmistakable,
and God protect the weaker. These
utterances indulged in to an alarming
extent by the Republican, are diaboli
cal in thie extreme, and -require to be
frowned down by every man ot hon
eat intelligence.,
But we deg'ess. After declaring
that the railroad tax question is not a
political one, the Reputblican whines
out that, it is gross injustice to "dis
franchise a large portion of tl.e popu
lation to determine the matter." It
no doubt is-from thie stand-point of
the Republican. Thie party which is
represented here by that sheet, has
been so much in tihe habit, for tihe
past 8 years, of voting taxes upon
other people's property, that it seems
strange they should not be allowed
to continue to do so. Thie "gross in
juatice" has always been thie other
way- nay, it has been the crirn of
the Republican party.
Tihe land owners expect, or have
to pap this railroad tax, if voted, and
the "great injustice" comes in when
Tom, Dick or Harry, without a cent
of property or a thought of interest
in the material advancement of the
country, comes up and,judges, by bal
lot, for or against whait th!e consider
to be a borden to them, and in conse
quence, to the whole inumaunity.
The voting population of the Re
publican party in this 8tate, have
not to this time evinced much regard
for their "future welfare," as is prov
en by the average olfce holder of this
section, hence, no one looking to
benefit the country, eares whether
they vote or not, for when they do,
their suffrages are generally given for
some "whiner" against "aristo
orats," as the Republieca terms, we
asuppose, every man of average res
pectabi)ity.
The expression that this New Or.
leans and Pacifice Railroad will bene
fit no one, save the stockholders of the
road, deserves the. severest comment,
for the Journal that would attempt
asuch a blundering aignment iB the
face of facts to tihe contrary, must
either take its readers for fools, or be
itself demented.

cc.~s iilnp ort;'r'e, the great 1metopl,,
lis' of the E:st ? lailroads ! Look
at Texas, which, ten years ago, was in
feri,,r to Louisiana in every respect,
;and is to-day, in lands and minerals,
the rival of any State in the West;
the home that is sought after by the
''p0OOr Inoan" and the ";lristocrat"~
the refige of the fleeing tmhosanlds
of the South, from Radical rnle and
Radical plunderers rwho do not iroat
railroads. What made her ? Rail
ºoads! And in the face of this, the
Natchitoches Tel)ublican has the bra
zen effrontry to tell us that railroads
are for the benefit of stockholders alone.
Bah! Ot nlupon such arguments. 1)Do
not "tilk glibly," but answer the ar
ticles ulpo "Railroad Benefits" which
lappeared in these columnts. It were
much better, if a desire to preserve
something like knowledge or common
sense is intended, to refute argument
with argument, u,,t slur them over
with a poor attempt to he cynical.
Let th ie Repiblicain state its reasons
for this opposition to the tax--which
are plain-so plain that the blind ity
read. The tax is not the thing t.lit
they are opposed to, feat is only an
evasioln; an artifice to conceal their
true feeling.
The Railroad itself is what they do
not want. Wlite immiUrationt is in
the dam distance, and death to radical
rule and irresponsible party leaders,
are the ghosts that haunt the waking
dreams of every negro leader on lied
river.
Come out and express yourselves,
don't attempt to hide your thrusts in
such niiserahle 'trash as the leader of
25th Septemnber.
The advent of "aristocrats"; men
with cleani shirts, white faces and
easy consciences, is what your average
Radical fears, and he feels in his heart
of hearts, that the whistle of the lo
comotive dooms to eternal oblivion
him and his party in Louisiana. Hence
all this cry set up by their pap-fed
organs, abont "burdens on the peo
ple"-burlleus they themselves incur
red without cossulting the taxpayer,
who, whlen attempting to act for him
self, is insultingly lectured on politi
cal economy by Radical papers. An
apt illustration of "Satan quoting
scripture." Our opinion is, that the
Repubhlica's articles in opposition to
the proposed Railroad, will have about
as much force, as Myers' in favor of it.
They will both pass by the oter on
that question, like the idle wind,
which they heed not, and which they
are.

Subsceribe to the Vindicator,
What has the Republican Party
Done for Louisiana.
The self-complacency, cheek, in
vulgar parlauce, with which the Radi
eal party of this State assumes to be
the party3' for the poor man, andi the
;arrogance they assume in qtuoting
thie great benefits that have accrued
to the State by reason of "Republican
ideas anti Republican principles,"
would be amusing, were it not that
it is somlthing like "laughing at a
fiuneral."
Logically speaking, Satan conld no
doult set up a line of argument,
whic.h to himself, at least, would ease
his conscience for the many sins lie
has committed, and when we draw
this parallel we -do not mean to in
suit his Satanic Majesty, for we think
the comparison between him and the
Radical party of to-day certainly
calls for this apology to him.
But to the question-how can they
have the brazen effiotry to proclhsim
good deeds, when their whole record
is one mass of corruption ; of evil
legi.Aiatiou. Can they claim to have
governed the people for the people's
good? The answer is given in ounr
ruined Commerce; our great State,
parochial and municipal debts; of
criminals unpunished, and when pun
ished, pardoned by the great (P) Kel
logg; why should these pett3 pilfer
ers, these small murders, be amena
ble to the law, when they, the rulers,
had plundered a people and butcher
ed a State. In the whole dreary
waste of Radical legislation, there is
not one g'een spot to which we can
refer, or they either, as having for
its object the benefit of State or peo
ple. Amd why f Because the parties
who led and composed the radical or
ganization were incapable of the
feeling of honesty of purpose, or as a
mass, too ignorant to understand the
qualities that go to make up a pure
statesman.
Louisiana has been plundered by
these miscreants, inside and out. No
scheme could be devised too outra
geous ; no act too palpably thieving,
that did not at once command their
attention and favors. With leaders
alive to oar people in both, feelings
and principle; with a mass of igno
rant, brutal negroes, just relieved from
bondage, filed with hatred to those
among whom they were born and
resrtd, these Radical poured down up
on us, committing more ravages than
the Goths and Vandals, and have
left Louisimia the wreck of her former
self. With all these outrageous laws
passed and inforced by them for the
past seven years, still disgracing our
Statute books, they have so little self
respect left as to ask at tile hands of
tihe people-a people they have in
suited, robbed and outraged a con.
tinuance of power, under the specious
promise of "doing better next time ;"
of ridding their party of its "bad
elements."
The guise is entirely too thin--the
promise lhas teen uade too often.
Nothing but itsutter distruction will
appease all thie true sons of Louisi
ana. No flaming protestations; no
death bed repeatance, will save them
from defeat. ?urify tie Radical par
ty of Louisiana to-dog, of all its bad
eknment, aml !yos leave not the rttage
of a wreck behirAl. There is not, nor
has there ever been, any good ele
ment in it. It was organised as a
party of plnnudr, and such it is to
day-distroy thoe cohesion of "swag"
and down goes the party-in fact the
Radical party lias done for Louisiana
what the robber did for the bank;
what the radical bank men all over
the North are to day doing-it has
plundered us of sastenance-piled a
debt on our people-murdered, in
suaited and tyrasised over our intelli
gence and manhood, and it stands to
day convicted by its own friends

zation of villainy and ignorance, that
ever disgraced a State.

Willis Holmes, Front
Street.
Now is the time to subscribe to I
the Vindicator.
Let the Radicals Show their
Game.
The folly of wise men is exemplili
ed in tho persistent attempt of a fa
vored few in New Orleans and else
where, to spring the people into a
mlovement they hoipe to control ; to
force them to a declaration of princi
ples which it is expected will bind
the party to such a line of policy as
may satisfy the personal ambition,
and gain the private ends of sonime as
piring gentlemen, without regard to
the public good. Louisiana has been
sorely afflicted with radicals; but,
the annoyance which we suffer, from
some would-be leaders, is begiuing to
be unbearable, so much so, as to al
most call for some action to stop
them.
We desire to treat with respect the
opinions of all our friends, and to be
personally polite to thenm; but, this
thing of a November Convention of
the Democracy has got to be mnonoto
nous with us, and we beg that a quie
tus may be put to it.
The radicals and negroes in New
Orleans, are showing their hands
plain enough, let them have full
stwing; their acts are in ridiculous
keeping with their declarations, and a
few more such moves will effectually
kill off the party which proposes to
combat us next year. Even this
move of Pinchlback's, et sic de simili
btus, may be construed into an overt
act to bring us from cover, a beating
the bush to frighten out the game.
How on earth our people can be de
ceived by these men, (and we know
that the masses are not) any longer,
passes our comprehension. Time
and time, have these shallow games
been played; we say shallow, be.
cause they are all seen through in
their incipiency, but, it seems to our
mind that some leaders are as easily
to be gulled now, as in the first in.
stance. We fear that there is some
"bonanui" behind all this; that the
"pelf-offering," seducing, good judg
ment and patriotism has been, and is,
enough to propitiate past offences; to
ease political conscience and make
those who would be patriots, traitors
sub roes.
In all those parishes where the ne
gro is largely in the majority, the
game to be played by the radicals
next year is apparent. Doubts ex
ist as to the line of "troop suppling"
by the President, as last year, being
made practicable again, at least no
chances will be taken on that score,
as it would be doubtil utility in the
face of a Democratic House of Repro
sentatives, waless by threats, insults,
mobs and demonstrations, sprinkled
with the usual amount of false ru
more and barefaced lies, some act
may be forcedl from the whites, simply
iu self defence, to bring about the
"third term" eiigency, when we ad
mit that the election will be carried,
like a fortification, at the point of the
ibayonet.
The desires of tihe Radicals, in
which they should be no way gratified,
is something like tihe Indian in war
fare; his enenmy has a strong, impreg
nable position, and defeat awaits them
if assault is attempted, to draw out
is the policy, and by jibes and taunts,
wh o ops and yells; brandishling
swords and beating tom-toms, they
expect to gain their end.
Our position is one, or should be,
of masterly inactivity ; keeping watch
and ward over every part of our lines;
holding the party well in hind; not
going out in vain sallies, hike this at
tempted, or to be attempted in New
Orleans. Such is supreme folly.
Louisiana and her safety apd sal
vation is the first consideration; we
have no business, no matter how
much tihe inclination, dropping our
State issues to take up Allen's, or
Tilton's, or Hendrick's, or in fact,
any one of them, even the National
Demtocracy. After we have made
our State stand, then we can march
up andt assist that great party wffom,
we presume, are not opposed to ac
cepting assistanee, no matter from
what quarter it may come.
We repeat, let vs remain quiet
within our works, let the enemy show
their forces, develop their purposes,
and when allis ready we trust to be
able to congratulate our citizens upon
an overwhelminog and lasting victory.

him a liberal share of public patron
age.
That Convontion.
We :are in reecipt of a cilenlllr a:l
dress from lion. R. II. Mlarr, of New
Orleaus, favoring this mulch talked of
political enterprise. As usual with
thal.t gentleman, the resonllnig is sotuntidl
and logical, :and tihe clauses i '!hy we
lshould thusn meet and reason togetlh
er are ably and clearly set fotith. But
we are of the opinion that Mr. Mtarr
umista:kes the feelings and purljposes of
the New Orleans ioliticians, and those
of neighboring pari~shes, i sppomsing
that the work of this proposed con
vention will stop short with the pur
poses indicated by him. There is one
thing concealed in this call that we
connot overlook, and it is the "putting
in line with tlhe Northern l)enmcracy"
-understand us to say that we are
Democrats and have no objections to
such a move at the proper time. Now,
there does not certainly exist an oc
casion for any snclh display of fealty
-our sentiments, as a people, are
well known to our Northern friends,
and a demonstration of them, uncalled
for, would be an act of rediculous
egotism.
If it could be certainly understood
that the acts of the convention would
be confined simply to local issues
matters pertaining to our home gov
ernment ; the naming the party ; (a
childish thing for men of intelligence
to qubrrel over) insisting upon the
recognition of the McEnery governu
ment ; inaugurating further peaceable
resistance to Kellogg and his infamy;
denouncing the use of Federal troops
in State matters; protesting against
aid demanding the repeal of all bad
laws; and discussing such other local
issues as may arrise, then we would
have (nor could we have) bo objections
to the proposed assembly that would
not be factions.
But that line, alas! cannot be fol
lowed. We know too well the "bull
headedness" of many truly good men
in our State; men' blessed with all
that nature and cultivation could sup
ply, but cursed also with the bourbon
fatality "appremire ries et oablier rica."
We venture to say, that, the con
vention would not be in session ten
minutes before some man of "weight"
would propose some resolution on
currency or tarriff; questions as
foreign to the salvation of Louisiana
as the antipodes, over which the
"wise" Democrats of the North are
going foolishly, ridiculously crag.
The right of the people to govern
themselves; the liberties of the cit
izen; the constitution of the govern
ment of ours forefathers is at stake,
but we find men-men of intelligence
higgling over names and crying them
selves blind with currency issues, tar
riff questions, and the seenming patriot
ismt of "putting themselves in line."
There seemes to us a blind fatality pur
suing the American people, and we
are sorry to see that they create many
of the evils under which they labor,
by blind zeal to departed issues and
dreamy Ihopes for impossible theories.
Louisiana, notwitlhstanding she has
been tried in thie crucible, has not es
caped the afflicetion, and we must fear
that the unmeaning zeal of a few
would-be patriots, will yet lead to
our defeat. For God's sake my couna
trymen, have done with this unwise,
fatal imbicility. Let us not attempt
to create division lb ous ranks now.
The great majority of the State has
pronounced agaiast this convention
