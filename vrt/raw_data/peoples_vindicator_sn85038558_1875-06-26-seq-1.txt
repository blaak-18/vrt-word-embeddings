3s WashinatestmP eet3s* Mage,
South Carolina.
The curious complication of affairs
which exists at this time in the Pros
trate State is little understood out
side its borders, owing to the fact ,
that nearly every prominent news- a
paper in South Carolina has given its I
adherence to the interests and policy
of Gov Chamberlain and his support
ers. Many excellent men in that I
State who were once bitterly opposed
to Chamberlain have become con
vinced that notwithstanding his evil
record, he is now earnestly engaged
in a work of real reform,; and there
fore they are willing to condole his I
past offences in the belief that he is
able and desirous to do the State he 4
has formerly pillaged great service in
relieving it trom its present unhappy
condition.
Withoet, qugie ng t .i m.i,ýt-f
any of those who have come to the
6upport of Gov. Chamberlain, we feel
bound to say that any alliance be
tween the white taxpayers of South
Carolina and the present Governor,
founded upon a belief in the sincerity
of the latter, must prove a fatal er
ror. More than this, we have the
strongest reasions for supposing that
the Governor has been instrumental
in the formation of a new bonddRing,
who, under the cover of Chamberlain's
newly acquired reputation for honest
ty, expect to reap a rich harvest from
the credulity of the creditors of the
State, many of whom are citizens of
- New York. For these reasons we
have deemed it a duty to warn the
public against what we believe to be
a dangerous scheme of plunder.
So far as the quarrel between the
two wings of the Republican party in
South Carolina are concerned, we
. care nothing except to hope that it
may.continue to increase in bitter
ness. If it does, some curious dis
closures may be made. The wing
headed by Speaker Elliot contains
the most vulgar; that led by Chanm
berlain the most accomplished and
dangerous rogues. The leaders of
neither faction are to be trusted, and
probably the truth is that the most
decent members of the Republican
party in South Carolina are those ne
groes who have not been contamina
ted by contact with the carpeet-bag
gers. Many of, these have become
disgusted with the wholesale stealing
which has been going on for the last
seven or eight years, and with pru
dent and conciliatory management
might easily be won over to the Con
servative party.-N. Y. Sun.
That certainly settles the question
as far as regards a political alliance
with what is termed, by some over
blown Conservatives of the Demo
cratic party, the moderate and good (t)
men of the Southern republican par
ty. Chamberlain has been landed to
the skies as an honest- man; a sin
cere ofllcial working only for the good
of the tax payers of South Carolina,
and to have this pet God knocked
'all into smitherepes by a charge of
this sort, is enough to make us for
ever swear haging anything to do
with combinations in fpture.
It.Is a nattdr easily understood by
us living on the ground, why no good
comes of this change of Governor ; for
llet any republican ke elected, be he
evqo, pmure- and good; Iis intentions

The Reli ious Card Player.
A private as dier, by the name of
Richard Lee, was taken before the
magistrate Glasgow for playing
cards duining divine service. The a:e
count of it is t ie given in the Eng
lish Journal:
A Sergeant comminded the sol
diers at the church and when the
parson had re d the prayers he took
the text.
Those who Lad a Bible took it out;
but this soldie" had neither Bible nor
common pray r book, but pulling out
a pack of card he spread them before
him. He firs looked at one care and
then another. The Sergeant of the
company saw Itim and said :
"Richard, p t up the cards ; this is
no place for tl em."
"Never mi d that," said Richard.
J-\benthe toioe was over, a con
stable took Richard a prisoner and
brought him before the Mayor.
"Well," said the Mayor, "what
have you brought tie soldier here
for T"
"For playing cards in the church."
"Well, soldier, what have you to
say for yourself ?"
"Much, sir, I hope."
"Very good--if not I will punish
you severely."'
"I have been," said the soldier,
"about six weeks on the march, I
have neither Bible nor common prayer
book ; I have nothiug but a pack of
cards, and I hope to satisfy your
worship of the purity of my inten
tion."
Then spreading the cards before
the Mayor, he began with the ace:
"When I see the ace it reminds me
that there is but one God.
"When I see the deuce it reminds
me of Father and Son.
"When I see the tray it reminds
me of Father Son and Holy Ghost.
"When I see the four it reminds
me of the four Evangalists that
preached-Mathew, Mark, Lake and
John.
"When I see the five it reminds
me of the five virgins that trim
med their lamps. There were ten,
but five were wise and five were
foolish, and were shut out.
"When I see the six it reminds me
that in six days the Lord made heav
en and earth.
"When I see the seven it reminds
me that on the seventh day God rest
ed from the great works which he
had made and hallowed it.
"When I see the eight it reminds
me of the eight righteous persons
that were saved when God destroyed
the world, viz: Noah and his wife,
his three sons and their wis t.
"When I see the nine it reminds
me of the nine lepers that were slens.
ed by our saviour. There were nine
out of ten who never returned thanks.
"When I see the ten it reminds me
of the ten commendments which God
handed down to Moses on the .table
of stone.
"When I see the Queen it reminds
me of the Queen of Sheba, who visit
ed Solomon, for she was as wise a
woman as lie was a man. She brought
with her fifty boys and fifty girls, all
dressed in boy's apparel for king Sol
omon, to tell which: were boys and
which were girls. The king sent
them to wash. The girls washed to
the elbows, and the boys to the wrists,
so King Solomon told by that.
•"Well," said the Mayor, "You have
describe eveigeard in the pack esx
eept one."
"What is that I"
"The nave," said the Mayor.
"I will give your honor a descrip
tiin of thit l @oo if you will not be
" ill' , tr aid the Mayor, "if you
do noit~rnai ne to be the knave."
"Thd greatest ksiave I know "of is
the constable that brought iue1 here."
"Ido not know,' eaid the: Mayor,
"if he is the greatest knave, but I
know be is the kreateat fool.t

VALEDICTORY OF AN EDITOR WITH

Laldisa The article is headed "Adios"
(adieu), but no one will venture to i
assert that, notwithstanding the pres- I
ence of lead so near the vital region, t
it is loaded with melancholy: t
"With this issue we step down and a
out from the editorship and proprie- a
torship of the Vineland Independent.
We commend the new proprietor to a
our patrons and friends, and hope a
and trust that under his management 9
the paper will give increased satisfac- t
tion to its readers. This sudden sun- 'I
dering of our connection with news- a
paperdom will surprise, and doubt- 3
less disgust, many of our friends;
but there was no alternative. Two
months' constant wrestle with a hos
tile bullet in our brain has convinced t
us that we lack the capacity to de
velop a lead mine and publish an in
dependent Vineland newspaper at
the same time. Our impaired eye
sight, shattered nerves and pulsating
brain admonish us that for the com
ing year we most not stray too far
from the Hospital.
"To our subscribers who, for the
past four years have, read the lude
pendent and paid for it, we hereby
tender our acknowledgments. Those
who have taken the paper just to
help it along, never volunteering a
dime or recognizing a dun, we shall.
feel it our duty, if we recover our
health, to thank in person.
"We can not omit to embrace this
perhaps last frceopportunity to thank
our editoral brethren, who in their
kindness of heart have flattered our
abilities, extolled our virtues and
whitewalshed our faults. The 'coy. I

to forgive and forget. I
