.:ME.2'IENG OF TWHE SCHOOL
TEA CHAERS.
A. general invitation is extended
Sb all teachers and superintendents
Sof;~ public instruction in the several i
parishes in the State to attend the
firut annual meeting of the Louisiana I
Publie School Teachers' Associa- I
.don, to be held in New Iberia on
the 26th a2tlr, and 2sth instants.
This meeting, from the arrange
-ments made and the program laid
out, promises far reaching results
. ii the advancement of public in
struution, and hence, it behooves
every one, who can possibly do so, to
attend, for matters of much interest ,
to him-as a teacher--will be dis
cussed, and must redound to his
profit.
By the efforts of the friends of
public education, a better sentiment
ifs being created, and it is the duty
of all to lend a helping hand,
so that those efforts will be produc
gve of the results expected.
Thedisinclination,or indifference,
of the general public to join in the
aspirations of those who make
teaching a profession, for better
methods, has been a draw back to
the efficiency of our public school
system. By taking part in every
step made to enhance the advance
ment of public education, they
will strenghten the hands of the
teachers, at the same time creating a
feeling of encouragement that will
give the teachers renewed confi
. dence that their labors are appre
eiated.
Then let us hope that that every
friend of our public- school system
wilPmake some personal sacrifice, if
need be, to attend the meeting, for
the larger the number present the
more will the management feel that
their efforts have met with public
favor.
An array of speakers will be heard
that for deep learning and interest
Fn the move, it would be difficult to
-suapass, so that every teacher wtll
have a .two-fold reason to attend.
First taking part in a movement in
which his avocation is blended,
and, second, he will listen to sub
jiects treated in a manner that must
prove instructive and interesting to
him in the future.

by our friends of both towns, in
keeping together the harmony and

becoming members of either Deba

1e here, but those of our people who
-d wish to hear Mr. Levy, the
ee great cornetist, can do so by going
dd to New Iberia where he will appear
ie Sunday. Here is what the papers
a- say of Levy:
sir Jules Levy, the foremost cornetist
of the day, pre-eminently the master
of his instrument and without a rival
Sin his sphere, while waiting for the
a, procession to start, played a dainty
e- fanfare. A mighty cheer went up
j. from the great 1crowd. Again the
'n silvery notes resounded, and as the
last tinkling notes died away there
came another loud burst of clapping
ft and cheers for Levy.-New York
r- Herald, Oct. 13, 1892.
:k The coming of Patti was no
:d greater event in the musical annals
of New Orleans than the presence,
at this time, of the greatest of all
LY living or dead performers on the
e. Cornet-a-Piston, Mr. Jules Levy, his
fame is as wide as the world. Those
as who have yet to hear of his wonder
e- ful music, see his complete master
ll ship of the instrument, his incom
us prehensible manipulation of the
pistons, and superhuman embou
cd hure and tonguing, will not hesitate
to concede his eminent right to all
the honors that have been heaped
ist upon him by all the musical judges
and critics of the age, as well as by
Kings and Queens and the titled
er nobility of the world. Vieuxtemps,
1g Ole Bull. Thalberg, Liszt, Jenny
Lind, Sontag, and Lagrange, all had
le their rivals and competitors, but
Levy is without a peer, and stands
ne pre-eminently as the greatest of all
