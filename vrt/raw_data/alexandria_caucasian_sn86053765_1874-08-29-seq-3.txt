The Directors of the Association in consequence of the impoverished condition of
our people and the general stringency of the trues, tind themselves unable to obtain
from the ordinary methods of raising funds—means sufficient and nec»ssarv to placo
this institution upon a solid and permanent basis—one that will enable theui tô
increase its sphere of usefulness and attractiveness to all classes of the public
To accomplish the following desirable ends: 1st. The extinguishment of all debt*
Directors do not disguise from themselves the difficiilties'wliWi must, uttend its
execution; but reposing their confidence in the worthiness of their aims, they ap
peal to the sympathy and priile of the citizens, especially of thin and our sister par
ishes, and to every public spirited LouiNimiian. to come forward and aid an ent«r
prise, which se ks only to build up and develop the resources of our lHnved State.
The object of the Association is to create a renewed interest among all classes of
onr citizens in onr coming Fair, and at the same time, by offering large inducements
to stimulate the sale of it* tickets to uu extent that will enable it to realize an*
amount adequate to its pressing wants The plan of The Association is to issue SO -
000 tickets nt seventy-live cents a ticket—tlie price of admission to the Fair with à
coupon attached bearing a number; the said ticket entitling the holder to one ad
mission to the Fair, the coupon being retained by himself.
On the hist day of the Fair, numbers corresponding with the number of tickets
issued, will be placed in a wheel, and all of the prizes in another, when tlie Grand
