It would be a poor tiresome old
world if there were never a joke in it
—if your face never cracked open
when you thought of something funny.
Some old cynic said that a smile was
originally a widening of the mouth,
preparatory to being fed. That may
be, but mouths must have widened
ages ago, for even dogs laugh—-I’ve
seen them laugh, and cry, too. One
kind of “smile” is going out of fash
ion, they tell me; but there’s a big
bunch of laughs that we have never
heard, and I want you to tell the
stories, so the world may laugh with
you. Last week’s jokes were slow, —
not just the right kind, one or two of
thorn, and they kind o’ wobbled in the
telling. Let’s try again.
First prize for the best joke or
funny story received in the next two
weeks: Boy’s, a handsome knife, with
a photogaph of Mr. Watson in the
handle; girl’s, a gold swastika pin,
which is the emblem of good luck.
Daddy Jim will also give a “conso
lation” prize for the worst joke.
The Lawd Done Tried.
Far and away the best story this
week comes from Mississippi, and we
are sending the prize to Beatrice
Lackey, 15 years old, Bodga, Miss.
“An old darkey wanted to join a
fashionable church in New York. The
minister did not think it would be
quite the thing, but he did not like to
refuse, so he said: ‘l’ll tell you,
Rastus; you go home and pray about
it.’ He did not see the old darkey
until a few days later, when he asked
Rastus if he had prayed. The old
darkey said: ‘Well, I’ll tell you, sa'h.
De Lawd, he done say, “Rastus, I
wouldn’t bodder my haid about it;

address solemnly tells us that the
15th amendment can never be re
pealed. Then, Mr. Taft, I can just as
solemnly assure you that the South
will never accept anything less. An
other forty years in the wilderness,
holding fast to our ideals of racial
purity and white man’s domination,
have no terrors for us comparable to
the possibilities from that Pandora’s
box of evils which the 15th amend
ment acquiesced in, would let loose
upon a divided South. I, as a South
erner, Mr. Taft, was sorry to hear you
say it, and can only hope that you do
not voice the sober second thought of
a majortiy of the States. I certainly
do not believe that it is the voice of
the West. But if you have so voiced
it, then I thank you for the utterance,
for it has put bands of steel around
the solidarity of the South that even
the warmth of your genial smile can
never cause to relax. You may tempt
the cupidity of the few by the dis
tribution of Federal patronage. The
commercial spirit (the same that made
Judas betray his Master) may cause
a few men in the cities to forget the
ties of blood and kindred and bow
down to your dictum, that thrift may
follow fawning. Such tactics, how
ever, will never seduce Southern white
men, the descendants of the brave
sires who fought for the right of self
government at Yorktown and Gettys
burg; or any other white skinned man
who cherishes the purity of the white

Come Again.
“This is my first time of writing to
the Jeffersonian, and I hope it will be
race as his most precious legacy, and
who refuses to share the dominion of
this fair Southland with savages from
the forests of Africa, no matter how
skillfully veneered with educations
that can not conceal the spurious ar
ticle beneath. You may make these
people of an alien race so-called citi
zens by laws on the statute books put
there without our consent, but I warn
you now that in the name of the
white manhood and womanhood of the
South, and I may add, I believe, of
many in the North, and of still more
in the West, that all the laws that
you can put upon the statute book
from now till doomsday will never
make them fellow citizens. The
strength of a nation consists in this
very feeling of fellowship and com
radeship between its citizens, and is
possible between all the varieties of
the Caucasian race; but never be
tween them and Mongolians, or Afri
cans. And it is the part of wisdom
and statesmanship to recognize this
before sowing the seeds of future civil
strife in this country.
Here, then, is the cause and justifi
cation for the solidarity of the South.
It is essentially the same that burns
eternally in the Irish breast, the right
to govern their local affairs without
dictation from outsiders.
The question then is, how and in
what way has our environment so
changed as to justify the abandon
ment of this instinctive and very ef
fective policy of standing together?

From Charleston, Ark.

expect I will be in the Seventh next

Fishing in Arkansas.
“One time I heard that when it
comes to catching large fish, Arkan
sas has got it by the tail and a down
hill pull. The largest fish I ever read
or heard of was caught out of the
Arkansas river below Little Rock. It
kept getting their bait and breaking
told us that he will cease to offend
our sensibilities by appointing negroes
to office in Southern communities.
Yes, but "while by this act Mr. Taft
practically deprecates the fruit of his
tree, he also tells us in the same
breath that he absolutely refuses to
lay any axe to its root.
Others again say, well you have
yourselves disfranchised the neg|*o,
and this removes the crux of your
complaint. If such disfranchisement
were permanent and complete this
would be conclusive. But we all well
know that this is only a temporary
makeshift, as long as the 15th amend
ment is law, and that ever increasing
numbers of negroes will qualify as
voters year after year, and any di
vision of the white people, with this
black contingent as a balance of power
between them, would mean that the
last state of the South would then be
worse than the first.
Much has been said about the race
problem and its solution. The only
way to arrive at the solution of any
problem, is to first state it in terms
that can not be misunderstood. The'
solidarity of the South is irrevocably
bound up with a satisfactory solution
of the race problem. And no solution
of that problem is possible on ah en
during and peaceful basis that refuses
to take into consideration the consent
of the Southern white people (who
are the ones most affected by it).
What, then, is the position of the ma
jority of the Southern white people
upon this question?
their lines. At last they got a black
smith to make a hook out of a crow
bar. They tied it to a steamboat
cable, and baited it with a muley cow
that had died with the hollow horn;
tied the cable to a tree, and the next
morning they had him. They were
afraid he would pull a team in the
river, so they got all the negroes for
miles around, and pulled him out on
the bank and hauled him to town.
When they cut him open, they found
in him another fish that weighed 200
pounds (by guess), three fat hogs, one
yoke of oxen, an acre of burnt woods,

Hurry Those Jokes.
Never mind how old they are. Send
them along, whiskers and all.
Disregarding the doctrinaires, I be
lieve I state it fully, frankly and fair
ly as follows:
That this Southland, hallowed by
the blood of our sires, and bequeathed
to us by them, is a white man’s coun
try and is open to all our Caucasian
kindred, who care to become citizens,
on terms of equality as to rights and
privileges. That we regard the negro
as so far below us in the scale of hu
manity, as to preclude the thought of
associating with him as a fellow citi
zen upon terms of equality; and will
never voluntarily consent to extend to
him those functions of citizenship,
which are not rights, but properly
classed as privileges, viz.: the elective
franchise, holding office, and sitting
on juries. We are, however, willing
to concede to the negro the same civil
and political, but not social status,
that we do to a citizen of Great Bri
tain, viz.: protection to life and lib
erty, the right to acquire and hold
property, and security against injury
of person or property. These latter
being the inalienable rights of man.
The former, being privileges, can not
be demanded as rights, and are, or
ought to be, entirely within the gift
of one’s fellow citizens.
