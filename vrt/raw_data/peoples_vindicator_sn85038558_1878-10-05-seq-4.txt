Every farmer that wishes to have
eboice fruit, should know how to bud.
Budding is much safer than grafting,
if th "t ; 4g. Ai t r~ i
etd i dt 1 1e& ai
can be budded again later in senason. sti
Just as long as the bark will -raise he
budding may be done, and if all the of
bodds fail the stock can be grafted sti
the next Spring. Buddling may be.
commenced in July had continued till i
September. he
Go among your neighbors and if 8e,
any have a choice variety of fruit cut to
a few scions of this years growth,
wrap them in damp moss, or cloths, we
until wanted for use. Pick a smooth to
place on the north side of this years ne
growth, is tle' i t Uif -k youin
intend to bua. M iAe "b cision
lengthwise downward throungh the Sa
bark about one half inch long with a ac
very sharp knife anrd small cut across si,
the upper end, so as to tesemble the at
letter T, cut a bud from your scion
with a smooth clear cot an inch long ii
with a little wood under the eye. wi
Be sure to pick a leaf bud, the sin to
gle pointed buds are the leaf buds,
and the double round buds are the 9
fruit buds, the fruit buds only make er
a blossom, but seldom make a tree, of
cut the leaf off, krJeting (WY in
stem on the bud to hold' it t tf
,the leaf ii left on it Vill er ap
mach sap, and the budt se
die. If yeo have no regilt W at
knife, make a flat pointed stick, to al
lift the bark with. Litft the bark with
care so as not to bruise it, and slip "
the bud downward under it. Tie tip tc
with soft bass bark or strips of cotton
cloth carefully, like tying utip a solre
finger, just leaving the eye of the
bud exposed.
To about two weeks the bandago
should be loosed, and if the bud is
green and fresh it will live. In three
or four weeks the bandage may he
taken off, if left, qn to la4g it trill
grow into the tree. Thrifty trees will e
often break off where tied. a
Buds- will live best if put in, in i
damp cloudy weather. In the winter
cut the stock off four to six i' tI
above the buds in 4t, t W , a
the bud starts out, if it ashoult clne
to grow side wise like a branch tie it
to the stub, with a tag string to make
it grow oup straight, The stub may C
be cut off smooth in "r.L.:
Plums live on the peach, and peoch
on the plum. Dwarf pears are made t
budding on the Angers quince.
Apples do no good on pears, or
pears ea apple.-.
The sweet eb4 does 3nQtl Toy
on the Morelio. Vafe shba b
to use only well developed and nearly
ripe buds, as green buds seldoni do e
well.
Cooking With Poor Batter. b
Professor Mott says: "There can be i
no doubt that a very large per cent. a
of the sickness amtong the poorer a
classes is due to the use of rancid
butter." "
If this is true, all oleaies a0 suf
fer from the same caupe4 aspoo
ple eat rancid butter, ns eohede:on ,
their bread; bet the same qulalityof a
butter is used Id chokitbg' Wtsooe of
the higbest-pticed tiairdgtie, a
restaurants, and botel. 'Tf it ifi
jurione to health-and we smippose it
is-we apprehend it isinju rfoos cook
ed as well as uncooked. The only ,
difference is that in cooking the bad
taste is disguised by mixing other
' materials with it.
Many private families buy butter r
to cook with which they would never r
think of puttiog on the table. Th
idea opia j a uno
not ogeuirad.·tdth. em '
sor Mott is right, rancid butter ould
be discarded entirely, even in cook
ing.
It is worthy of remark that while
excellent butter ase Ie recently
sold as low s'*e cents a
pound, a few ddontiue to
command one dollar a pound for all t
they prodoce.
Cow Choking.
A veteran farmer told me a few
days ago of a mpthod ofving rlei gal I
choking cow, *hlich &'sa ne to me,
but which he assured me was unfail
ing. It is worthy of trial, at any
rate. A round stick, two or three i
inches in diametei, and six or eight
inches long is pat into the cow's
mouth, like a bit into a horse's mouth,
a string is then fastened td each end
of the stick and tied :o the borns, or ,
up over the head. This forces her to 1
is tiny O8ta ef the
rapi't swelling which : o actomphkneel

removed in this w the cow may be
kept alive iretil h is obtained tol
