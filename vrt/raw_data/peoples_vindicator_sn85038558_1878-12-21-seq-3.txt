Our patrons are presented in conn '
tion with these honored Christmas 0 1
nogg and turkey, with a present fro" us
in the shape of a splendid editionf t the
VINDICATOR. No such onrerprike has
ever before been attempcted here, and I
we question if any country paperi" 011 A
State, has ever issued such a shet. T
We pride ourselves upon being in the
C
front rank of what is known as cowtry
journalism, to sustain which positio) we '1
have received the generous suppt of Li
a large and influential circulatioiand
advertising patronage. For this 4 are TI
grateful. We feel that gratitude ten, W
sified, because we see in that suprt an Blt
earnest appreciation of our etff for
Ti
our parish, our State and the ruse of
their people.
We are flattered by the hop ,at the Be
future has in store for our peop Gems
of prosperity to recompense th for the h
bleak, dreary chastening of ! past "P
years. In that glow of "gu ck"l the An
VINDICATOR will earn its r rdI; and tie
in eager longing for those ht days,
asks but a continuance of co 'uce andt
patronage from its many re s, while ie1
it wishes them one and a MERRY,
MERRY CIRISTMAS.

THE QUARREL OVER A GAME OF CARDS

BACK OF THE
AMERICAN
CEMETERY
INCIDENTS OF THE AFFAIR.
In a southeast platte of the American
Cemetery in this city, is an upright slab
.of plain marble, upon which is inscribed:
In Memory
Of the Lamented
W. L, M'MILLEN,
With dates of birth and demise.
The curious wonder who lies there in
terred, and many have askod of the
sleeper in that grass.grown grave' Read
or, it contains the dnst of one who fell
on the field of honor, near by; and the
incidents of that tragedy will be at least
of interest to you. W. L. McMillon was
a merchant in this town in years agone;
"A quiet, orderly and social gentleman,"
so those who knew him tell us. A difi
cuity occurred at his rooms between
himself and a Mr. George Williams,
brotherof an old, well:known and much
esteemed citizen, Frederick Williams,
Esq,, now deceased. It was over a game
cf cards, and resulted in a challenge
from Williams to McMillen.
Dave Burnett, Esq., was the second of
the former, and Mr. Adolphe Sompayrac,
ot the :tter. Neither knew anything of
the modus operandi of dueling, and both
were indifferent shots, They met on a
cold winter's morning, in 1836, just' back
of the Ameiican Cemetery, where Mc
Millen has peacefully slept all these in
tervening years, and at the first fire Mc
Millen was shot. The ball entered just
above the right hip and shattered the
spine. He lingered paralized for two
dlays and died, Williams escaped un
touched.
Of the parties who were present at this
sad afsafr but the attending surgeon is
now alive, Dr. F. Johnson, of this city.
Williams, the unhurt principal, died
years ago in Texas, somewhere. Mr.
Adolph Sompayrae, a prominent citizen,
of a prominent family of our paris6, died
in 1853; while Dave Burnett was drowned
in Cane river while attempting to save a
negro man from the same melancholy
fate. He rests near McMillen on a Pine
clad hill in the American Cemetery. A
singular fact is told of Burnett's violent
death which has been lately reported to
us. It seems the negro whose fate Bunr.
nett shared in a vain attempt to save
him, was a big, burly yellow boy, who
was constantly involving his owner
(Burnett) in trouble, and Barnett was
heard to exclaim, "That negro will be
the fate of me yet."
Whether or not he had a supernatural
warning of that awful fate which befell
him, must be left to others to determ
ine.
Our Patterson who is of a highly.
ebony hne, sports his hair in beautiful
short crls and furnishes the muscular
power to run off our edition, is known
by the compositorsof the ofice, to be a
great chewer of old dietionaries on words

pit him against a ceqrtain groceryman in
this town who spells hologna with a 'y.'

Cooper has surrounded the "poor

gend connected with some tribe and
many have been the maidens, who,
from grief for their lovers, have leap
ed from some tall cliff or bluff over.
hanging some river on this continent.
The old Indian village here stood
upon a "Blnf;" there were lovers
and maidens in those days, undoubt
edly; but, tradition is silent upon
the suicide girl-lover, and "our bluff"
is not called "The Maidens Leap."
On the contrary, it is vested with
euphonious titile of of "Baden's

tbok its name from an old fellow who
fell from its summit into the river
one night when too drunk to navigate
either land or water.

Tomnatoes for Supper.
For a family of half a dozen persons, take sit
eggs, boil four of them hard, dissolve the yolk
with vinegar sutlicient, and about three tea
apoons of mustard. and mash as smooth as poe
sible; then add the two remaining,eggs, raw,
yolk and white, stir well; then add oil to make
altogether sauce sufficient to cover the tomatoes
well, and plenty of salt atnd cayenne pepper,
and beat thoroughly until it frosts Skim and
cut the tomatoes a full fourth of an inch thick,
and pour the sance over, and you have a dish
fit for a President.

Here is a hint for Georgia sheep raisers de*
spairing of the proper legislative protection
An Ohio tarmer says the N. Y. Herald, who
possesses a good deal of sagacity, says that
dogs will kill sheep by tearing open the large
veins of the neck and sucking the blood and
when they once get a taste can never be broken
of the trick; and a sheep killin dog will teach
others. The first time a dog kills a sheep he
isil suck the blood and then eat a little and be
satisfied He will soon learn to kill several,
sucking the blood until he is full, eating no
flesh the first night. When sheep are killed by
dogs, skin them and let them Ilie in tha same
place. The first night, after killing the dogs
may not return, but lthey will be on hand the
second night. Cut 4 or 5 gashes in the shoulder
of the dead sheep, put a small amount of first
class strychnine in the gashes and next morn'
ing you will be sure to have them. I have kill
ed as many as four in one night;
