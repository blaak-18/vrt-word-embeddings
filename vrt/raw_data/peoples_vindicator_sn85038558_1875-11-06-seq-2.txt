Blunt', side show, under startling
head lines, made its appearance in
last week's Republican, and the wit
was spon taneous, heartrending, amu
all but doleful-since reading David's
Psalms we have never been so con

should be muzzled at onee, for fear
some ente'rprising man might pick
him up as a prefaee writer to chris

The political horoscope presents,
I notwithstanding the failure of Ohio
Democrats, many cheering signs to
the patriot, indicative of a glorious
future, and upon a study of the East,
we can reasonably predict the early
and total disruption of the radical
party.
Held together simply by the cohe
sion of plunder, its leaders have af
flieted this country with evils, such
as no people have yet been compelled
to suffer; at least no people claiming
to enjoy a fbrm of government called
Democratie.
Some philosopher has said, that in
republices, those who swayed it over a
conquered foe, were most tyrannical
-how well this axiom is verified.
The party in power for the past sixteen
years, have made fealty to party, the
test of loyalty to our institutions; eve
ry one who was not a republican, was
a traitor-ready to rebel, or in league
with the outlhern people, who pant
ed but for another opportunity to
destroy the Union. Formed as it
was, of a mass of men, in the first
instance, possessing views widely
different upon policies of Govern
ment, a unit in opinion upon but one
article of faith, the destruction of
slavery, and the perpetuation of the
Union thereby, it is but reasonable to
suppose that upon the accompllsta
ment of these olijects the radical par
ty should resolve itself into the sepa
rate and distinct parts from which it
sprung.
It is now, in fact, in process of dis
integration, and a moon shall scarce
ly wane ere it will be remembered as
a hideous dream, and upon awaken
ing, the American people will shud
deringly gaze into the awful vortex
of ruin, to the brink of which the
country has been brought during the
lease of power accorded that party.
Four years ago the sway of the
giant monster, radicalism, was su
preme in nearly every quarter of the
Union. The constitution was a foot
ball to be used and abused as the
party in its perpetuation might deter
mine. Laws were enaeted in direct
violation of that sacred instrument.
Its substance was exchanged for the
shadow ; Union first, was the cry;
Constitution and liberty last. Thieves
walked in high places, the head and
front of the party.; Grant, set the ex
ample, and corruption held high revel
amid the ruins of all our traditions
and our liberties. Every department
of our government felt the withering
hand of some votary of radicalism.
The War Department has been dis
graced; the navy ' has been robbed;
the judicial ermine befou)ed by such
as Williams, Dnrell and others; the
treasury lhas been made tile pencula
ting pool of Wall street brokers; the
ptor Indian has been ploundered and
driven by etarvation, to war; sCoun
drels of every die, from thie safe bur
'glar, Harrington, to the Indian thief,
Delano, have bteen rewarded; rela-.
tionshlip to the President has been a
passport to official honor, which was
no sooner acquired thlarn dishonored;

horde of thieves and plunderers, un

wards.
But we are proud to say that those
dark clouds that dimmed our conotry's
glory, are passing away; thie bright
refulgent sun of liberty is dispelling
the gloom that has hung like a pall
o'er this Union, its streaks with am
ber-hued tints, thie East, heralding a
dawn of ineffable glory, prospetity
and liberty for our people. The band
writing, dooming to destruction this
monster of iniquity, this Radical Re
publican party, is traced on the wall
by the finger of this mighty, potent
people. The political requiem of
Morton, of Blaine, of Butler and the
mighty hlost who, Mso long defied
liberty and defiled its temple, is being
chanted from Maine to California. Ig

sewers of society, from whichl they

gushing piece of sarcasm. It falls

At one time Myers stood well with

the simile, for it is too greatly over
drawn; Jesus was a better man, as a
man, than we, and Myers-is worse
than Judas, for lhe went and hanged
himself,) but that did not stick.
We voted for Myers once, but have
never ceased to regret it; we once
thought him honest, but think so no
longer. There have been many sins
commited by men, of omission and
commission, that they have never
ceased to regret-one of the latter

The festival of All Souls day of the
Roman Catholie church, which falls
upon the second of November, is a
custom beautiful in thought and ex
pression. Upon that day the decora.
tion of the graves of the deaut takes
place and by prayers and alms giv.
ing we are supposed to alleviate the.
suffering souls in Purgatory. This
feast was first introduced, we believe,
in the monastery of Clugny, A. D.,
993. The following is the account
given of the circumstance in which it
originated:
A pilgrim returning from the Holy
Land, was compelled, by a storm, to
land on a rocky island somewhere be
tween Sicily and Thessalonies. Here
I he found a hermit who told him that
among the cliffs of the island was
situated the opening into *o other
Sworld, through which huge flames
Sascended, and the groans and cries
Sof souls tormented by evil angels were
Saudible. The hermit had also fre
Squently heard the complaints and in
t prications of the devils, at the num
I ber of sonis that were torn from them
â¢ by the prayers and alms of the pionus;
I they were especially enraged, he msaid,
I against the Abbot and monks of Clug
I ny. The pilgrim on his arrival as
Squainted Odilo, Abbot of Clugny,
I with what had come to his knowl
I edge,.and the Abbot thereupon ap
pointed the day after "All Saints,"
I to be kept in his monastery as
iran annual festival for "All 8ouls."
I The observance was adopted by the
whole Catholle world, and upon Tues
I day last the faithful here commemo
rated the day in a beautiful manner.
SThe graves of the dead were splen
Sdidly decorated and high mass was
rsung in the Cathedral. During the

WHITr LiEa.--That's the name
we go by; that's what Radicals call us,
and like Washington's rfleb, we are
proud of it; proud of it, for it is the
synonym of manhood;the mark oft
civilization; the distinctive api)ela
tion belonging to one who inherits
and bears, with honest pride, the true
blood of the noble Caueassiani.
White liners are white mea. Men
who love their race and people above
all others; who are not maudlin phil.
anthrophists for paltry pay or office.
In Louisiana they are those who
represent its intelligence, its virture,
its wealth-the contrary are its vil
lains, thieves, liars and jail birds.
We would rather be a dead white
liner than posses a thousand cat-like
lives qf a radical pimp. Radical
means every thing that is mean, pal.
try and despicable- It'hie Liner every
thling that is manly, honest and in
telligent. Yes, we are White Liners,
now and forever, and we tell you mis
erab'e radical harlots, "to your tents"
for we are upon you.
We commend to the Coushatta Cit
izen especially, tile letter in this
week's issue of the Vindicator from
Clinton, East Feliciana parish, Louis
iana, as the editor of that paper has
taken occasion to give currency to a
few of his thought. against thoso peo
ple who dealt summarily with GairI
and others.
The Citizen. we fear, is a wolf in
sheep's clothing, and has, in a meas
ure, overreached itself in denouncing
the people of East Feliciana as a
"blood thirsty, drunken mob." We
could look for such expressions from.
the New Orleans Bepublican and its
ilk, but from the Ciltes, and it pub
lished in Red River parish, never!
We ask of it a calm perusal of the
dispassionate letter alluded to, parti
cularly that part which relates to
"the blocked halls of justice," and we
conceive that ft will make haste to
tone down such expressive feelings
for "courts and the law," especially if
held and administered in the.Eaat
Felician. way.
Suppose, by way of variety, the
Citi~s fires a gun (squib is about the
proper name for its metal) into Kel

ernment, that is, if there be no dan
ger of the recoil, i. e. lose of printing

Let the Citises time itaelf to fring
its gones, when properly loaded, in the
proper direction, and there will be no
danger at either end, which, however,
is very near tk ease now.
