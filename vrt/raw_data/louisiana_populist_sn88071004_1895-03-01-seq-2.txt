NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to select the paper
in which the advertisement is to be
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a bid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
FREE SILVER.
It is now admitted by most of
our leading dailies-even some of
the gold-bug organs-that silver
as money is gaining ground, not
only in the United States but even
in the undisputed territory of the
Rosthchilds--Great Britain.
Any proposition favoring bonds
payable in coin has been rejected
by both' branches of congress,
while bonds payable in gold only
have been overwhelmingly defeat
ed in these legislative bodies.
Legislation authorizing the free
coinage of silver, has been defeat
ed in congress only by the filibus
tering tactics of a minority that is
rapidly dwindling to insignificance.
A few days ago Senator Dolph,
of Oregon, an ardent gold-bug, was
defeated fpr re-election, notwith
standing he had a caucus nomina
tioa of the dominant party in his
legislature, and his successor-Sen
ator McBride, was elected as a free
silver advocate.
The cablegrams from England
in giving the reanlts of the ele
tios there, tar members of par
lamest, show that in almost every
latem free silver advoeates have
brem sleted, s.d it is believed
tat the general election next year

reformers, every Congressman or
Senator sent to Washington by
this new party (the Pcople's) has
voted first, last and all the time
for cheap money and free silver,
and many of the test votes that de
cided the fate of silver, and on the
other hand, gold-bearing bonds
were decided by the adherents of
this party.
By the organized efforts of these
people, through the People's party
for the most part, their teachings
and prophecies have been dissemi
nated, until not only their own par
ty is a unit upon their ideas, but
they have invaded the rank and file
of both of the old parties, and
made thousands, aye millions of
converts who have about lost faith
in the old organizations, and are
preparing to join the new.
These leaders and pioneers have
appeared almostas prohphets, since
by their unbiased analysis of the
functions of money, and the histo
ry of its effects upon the people
of past nations, they have been
able to predict with the certainty
of knowledge the present misera
ble condition of our people occa
sioned by contracting the currency
of our country to the narrow hm
its of a gold standard.
And while favorable silver legis
lation is not half of the financial
reform and relief the country must
and will have, yet it is a beginning
that will surely lead up to the oth
er lines of reform, and break the
barriers of ignorance that are now
blockmg the road to the other
wholesome reforms in land owner
ship and railroad management* set
forth in the People's party plat
form.
The patient but valorous heroes
who have made war upon ignorance
and consequent prejudice for a
quarter of a century, can now see
the light of a glorious morning
breaking above the horizon-a
morning that is to crown their no
ble and untiring warfare with a
glory that will not fade, while the
grander civilization made possible
thereby continues to bless man
kind.
ProuHIrrON WINS,
Natchitoches Sends Greeting,
And Follows Ouachtia's
Good Example.
At the close of a campaign in
which no excitement and but little
illfeeling was engendered and
scarcely any work done by either
side, prohibition has carried the
anient, wealthy and populous old
parish of Natchitoches.
The result is that of cool, sober,
deliberate action of our beat citi
zens, and while many ot them fav
ored saloons for divers reasons,
they have conducted an open, hon
orable campaign, earned the res
peat and confdence of their oppo
nents, and wdill now quietly submit
to the ordinance like the law-abid
ing good citizens they are.
After the 31st day of December

in calling the attention of our peo
ple to the possibilities of a similar
result in this parish, and as admit
ted by the men who started the agi
tation ot the question in this par
ish, it was the discussion of that
publication that gave rise to the
suggestion of its agitation here.
Similar campaigns are even now
being conducted in the great par
ishes of Caddo and Madison, in
this State, and we hope they will
result as has ours, and that the ti

Has Senator Jones Made a Mis
take in not Forcing the Issue.
Editor POPULIST:
When the leading papers begin
to see that a great wrong has been
done and is being persisted in,
when they can see and understand
the nature of the wrong and iden
tify the perpetrators, and the mo
tive, and when, having made these
aiscoveries, they show a disposi
tion to condemn and call to an ac
counting, then have we some en
couragement to hope.
The comments of the Times
Democrat on my letter on "Agri
cultural depression" and on a com.
munication from "silver," "The
question of the day" give us to un
derstand that that paper appreci
ates the situation and is enlisted
with us to effect a change.
But what have we to go through
before the old order is restored?
Such ruin cannot be wrought and
undone in a day. The T. D. justly
says that it will require years of
the most favorable conditiolts to
restore the country to where it was
only a few years ago.
The men who have perpetrated
this great crime against this people
have not done it unwittingly.
Twenty years ago John G. Carlisle
denounced the business he is now
engaged in, the destruction of sil
ver, as the greatest crime ever per
petrated against the human race;
but the power of gold is great, too
great, The interests of the few
powerful and great, who have put
out gold bonds must be protected
though the nation dies.
"Silver" asks very pertiuently,
.'will the people be fool enough tq
submit?"
Yes, if we are to follow the cotin
sel of menl like W. W. Stone, presi
neut of the Mississippi cotton
growers who says that though a
change might benefit us "the com
men people canllot force a change."
Either Mr. Stone knows nothing
about law, and the first principals
of bhuman government, or he Is at
the head of the Af. C. G(. A. not in
the interests of the great class he
prentemds to represent.
Does not every intelligent citizen
know that governments are insti
tnted for the lenifit of the great
masses governedl-aln that when
Igovernmelt fails of the ends of its
being, then the people have certain
inalienable rights, rights that.
spring from the law of self-preser.
vatioi/ And our form of govern
ment is exempt from the application
ofthis rule
1 have said that these men are
not forcing these conditions on us
nuaitttingly. They know what
they are doing and they prolpose
that we shlla stand it. Every t.
nancier knows that prior to the
demonitisation of silver, credit
money had been issned nlpol it, as
a mnoney of ultimate redemptionl up
to its full carrying capacity, and
know that the foundation could
not be destroyed withoutt wrecking
the whole superstructure of basi
ness, values, eredit and all based
upon it. But to make eredit with
Enugland and indue English gbl,
and for the benift of the few, all
this rain must be wrought, and
"the commonl people must stand
it, will they stalnd it Are the
eomdttions such that our govern
meat ean now afford to temporize
with this vital question?

mistake in ecoasentng to a poet.

copartners in the great bond deal,
the Wall Street banking house of
Drexel, Morgan & Co.
Cleveland's law-firm are the reg
Ilar attorneys of the last named
gentlemen, and therefore it was
the most natural thing in the world
for the bond deal to xtw made
through Francis L. Stetson, the
law partner of Grover Cleveland.
By a secret contract wherein all
competitive hiddling was rendered
imnposile, Stetson bought from his
partner, Cleveland, $8;2.40(),000 at
about $1)0,000,0 )00 less than regular
market price.
Cleveland, as President of the
United States, sold the bonds, and
the Rothschilds syndicate bought
them.
Thus one partner, acting as Pres
ident of the people, played into
the hands of the other partner
acting as lawyver for the Roths
ehilds and the Morgan, and Bel
mounts.

And how much did partner
Cleveland get?
Cleveland, Stetson & Co. were
the lawyers; Morgan, Rothscilds,
Belmont & Co. were the clients;
Taxpayer, Producer & Co. were
the victims.
Belmont is a national hanker of
New York and has served the dear
old democretic party in variousdis
tinguished capacities.
Drexel, Morgan & Co. are the
Wall Street financiers who have
been buying up all the Southern
railways, and consolidating them
into one gigantic Trust in violation
of law.
The Rothchilds are the eminent
financiers who are worth upwards
of $2,00,000,000, and who hold
mortgages, in shape of bonds, on
almost every valuable piece of ter
ritory in the world.
Cleveland' Stetson & Co. have
now'mortgaged the United States
to these European money-kings,
and for thirty years we are to pay
them tribute.
In open market the 30 year 4 per
cent bonds are worth at least 119.
By secret contract Cleveland &
Stetson the lawyers sold them for
104.
Here is a net gain of about $10,
000,000 made without any expense
or delay-just "picked up in the
road."
I)o you believe Cleveland would
have sold these bonds at so much
less than their market value, unless
he had some share in the booty i
The 4 per cent bonds of the ne
gro colony of Jamaica are worth
111. Cleveland sold ours at 104.
The poor negroes, being untu
tored and semi-barbarous, have not
learned the Democratic method of
doing busines~e, hence their bonds
sell higher than ours.
"Pubhc office is a public trust."
SSo said the fat fraud of Buzzard
Boost in 1884.
The sentence might now be al
tered so asto read "Public office is
a bonanza for me adl my law
firm."
The 4 per cent bonds of Athol,
Mass., sell on the exchange for
107*; those of Brocton, Mass-, for
107; those of Cambridge, Mass.,
for 108; those of Detroit, Mich. st
108; thoseof Hudson County, N.
J., at 1081.
There are the various other 4
per cent bond of States, Counties,
Cities, Towns, Manufacturing
Companies, and Railroads which

deal higher price than partner
Stetson paid partner Clevelad for
30yearmortgage on all the im
mense property contained in the
United States.

Why didn't he give a chance to
the other buyers, besides the syn
',icate represented by his law-firm l
Why did he make Carlisle steal
away to New York, and make the
sale of this enormous lot of bondls
on the sly.
Why did he hide the fact that he
had sold the bonds to the clients of
his law-firm, and had, by written
agreement, given them the refusal
of all other bonds that will be is
sued between now and October?

emptied its national treasury, and
beggared its people.
Not content with destroying the
present generation he reaches out
to enchain the ganeration to come.
By deciding that "coin" means
gold only, he has violated the law
and outraged common sense.
By deciding that a legal discre
tion to pay silver notes in either
silver or gold, means that they
must be paid in gold only, he has
trampled on the statute and mock
ed the people.
By decidmi that the way to sus

crease the government expenses
and the national debt, he has inso
lently broken every pledge .he and
his party ever made to the people,
and has insulted the conscience and
the intelligence of every respecta
ble citizen.
In making a secret and shameful
bargain with his law partner, by
means of which the syndicate com
posed of his law-firm's clients gets
a 30 year mortgage upon all the
vast wealth of the Union, at ten
millions less than it was worth in
the open market, he has committed
an act of vulgar, commonplace,
greedy and brutal dishonesty--an
act which would put behind the
bars any railroad president or fac
tory president, who would have
dared thus to plunder, through his
law firm, the business interests
committed to his care.
Why should not Grover Cleve

No Judicial Nominatioa.
The executive committee of the
People's party of Winn parish, at
their meeting in Winnftield Jan
nary 30th, adopted the following
submitted by their committee on
resolutions:
Whereas, since the foundation of
our republic it has ever been one
ipoint in statesmanship to remove
as far as possible the Judiciary
from partisan politio. in order, if
possible, to administer justice in
strict accordance with and in bar
mony with the natural rights that
the bhumaan family should enjoy un
der civilized form of government,
and
Whereas, it is a lamentable fact,
that in past years even the Supreme
Court, the highest tribunal in the
land, when rendering decisions at
aeting the future welfare of either
or both of the dominant political
parties, that these hocored and im
portnt ftactors of our government
have divided upon sueh questions,
strictly upon p.ty lines regardless
of Justinae; and,
Wlhereas. in the interest of goodl
governiul*lnt u111il the )nes1t .11 lt
impartial alniini.tration of.rustice,
your couimittee be!ieves it unwise,
if we should take cognizrance of the
past, to confine the .Jludc iaruy to
partisan linest therefore
Resolved, that we rmecnunoni
your Judicial Ex-Cominnittee to call
nc Judicial nominatiug convention
and take no steps to indorse or
nominate strictly party canidates
for Judicial positions.
The Winn Parish Comrade, in the
course of an editorial article com
menting on the above ation of the
executive committee makes the
following sensible and appropriate
remarks
The simple iadministration of
justice should know no party lines,
but just solong as the courts are
made responsible to any political
organization for their positions,
decisions affecting the welfare of
such orginization and its most
prominent leaders will be warped
by partisan prejudice and justice'
crushed and defeated, weeps with
out hope.
All courts should be made elec
tive by a direct vote of the people,
and without regard to party lines,
thus forcing the aspirants for these
positions before the people solely
upon their merits, and not for the
valiant service they had rendered
some political party.
Native talent, legal aoility, con
sciencious scruples, good morals,
and firm yet sympathetic natnres
should be made the test qualifica
tions of judicial candidates and not
loyal devotion toany political party.
SAWDUST FOR BREAD.
A Chicago Society Wants to
Adulterate It With Rye Flour
A proposition has been made in
Chicago and it emanates from a
charitable society, to feed the poor
upon bread made partly of wood.
It is asserted that in Berlin there
is a great bakery where two hun
dred weight of wood bread is turned
out every day for popular consump
tiou. The bread is made out of
sawdust and rye flouer-three
fourths sawdust. A chemical pro
cess, it is said, takes away the
texture and the tastes of the saw
dust and liberates the sacharino
elements, and with a little rye
flour, the compound makes nutrit
ive bread, which is sold very cheap
ly.
Now a Chiacro society wants
to feed the poor upon this new staff
of life. Why, however, have three
parts sawdust? Why not sawdust
pureand simple? Sawdust ought
to be good enough for a working
man, and if he prefers rye or wheat
bread, it simply shows that he is an
idle dog who does not want to earn
his living, but is envious of the rich.
If sawdust comes into general
use as a food for the poor, it will
greatly benefitthe country, for the
workingman can then live upon less
wages, and the cost of production
of all commodities will be lessened,

Why do Some Men Catch More
Fish?
Some men catch more fish than
other mendo. It is mpposedthat
this is because they we more skill
ful. Those whq take careful note,
however, observe that the more
successful fisherman devotes more
time to it. He begins earlier,
sticks more closely to it. and quits
later. The conclusion is that the
man who catches most fish fishes
most hours. It is precisely the
same way with advertisers. Some
are skillful some are not. The
most successful advertiser is always
the one who does the most of it, and
keeps it up thelongest---Facts and
