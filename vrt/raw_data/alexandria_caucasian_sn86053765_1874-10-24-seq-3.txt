who again took the three rings.
Tho tie for time between tho bor

made by one second.
Tho tie between the Knights of

First Race —Consolation Purse
Dash of one mile. Purse 850.00.—
Tbe entries were as follows:

O mto II Jonen' 1». h. Rapides, Jr 2
W. L. Satiford's 1». in. Gipsey, 3
Time 2.01.
The second race of a Quarter of a
mile was run iu the rain and we
did notice the entries. We saw W.
K. Johnson's Jim liiossnt, come uu
der the string in tbe bad ns he usu
ally does iii any sort of a race, but
we do not know what was tho do
cision.
We are in the same fix in rela
tion to the trotting race for which
there were four entries. We look
ed out a window during the rain
aud saw our successful friend, Capt
A. M. Haas, so lar ahend with his
bay horse Avoyelles, that we ]>r<
siiiue he distanced his competitors.
Our excuse for not being on duty
as reporter in Mio Judge's Stand
during these races is that we were
just then on duty iu another quar
ter.
After we left the grounds there
was auothor trotting race for a pri
vato purse in which Capt. Haas
with tho same horse won and made
tho mile it} 3.07.
THE BALL.
The rain in the afternoon proba
bly prevented many from attending
the ball in tho grand building on
tho Fair Grounds who'would other
wise have been there, but there was
notwithstanding tho largest attend
ance that wo have ever seen at a
ball in Rapides. There were over
a hundred gentlemen's tickets tak
en in at tho door and there was
probably moro ladies present than
gentlemen. Yeagar's Band from
New Orleans with string instru
ments made most excellent music
for thobccasiou and the festivities
wero kept up until an early hour in
the morning. The fair daughters
of St. Landry, Natchitoches, Avoy
elles, Catahoula and Rapides who
had graced the Grand Stand dur
ing tho day were gathered here and
the ° scene in tho ball room was
lovely boyoud description. The
calico dresses worn by them all,
and we must do tho ladies tho cred
it of saying that we saw none but
calico dresses, were in pleasant con
trast to tho usual ball toilets and in
our opinion, made the sylphs, ser
aplis and houris who wore them
look moro lovely, it possiblq ^han
they would have done iu tbe^^ilks
and satins. We arc relieved the
common duty of newspaper reporter
of making special mention of ele
gant costumes, and if we were io
particularize our mention of some
of the bright eyes and bewildering
charms of the fair ladies, we won id
offend them, so we shall close Un

the awards.
We give below the official list of
the awards made by the Jpdgcs,

taken from the original reports will
doubtless be found correct unless

Committee.
Capt. Dick Sinnott .— And now
here we arc in a nice fix ! We like
both his rivals in this trade and af
ter giving each a third ol the trade,
we can't help wishing that we had
three thirds loft for our bully old
friend Capt. Dick and his A. No. 1,
tip top steamer Sabine. We ran
right up on him at the Fair
Grounds on Monday last and nofc
withstanding that he had already
iven the Association $50.00 in pre
miums, wo made him give us $2.50
for a quarter stretch Badge and
sent him on his way rejoicing. We
have missed him "muchly" this sum
mer while he was detailed in New
Orleans settling up his brother's af
fairs and welcome him back again
with many hearty good wishes for
his success and prosperity. If he
hadn't gone down a day too soon
we'll bet our bottom dollar that he
would have taken the Band back
to the city for nothing too. Nobody
can get ahead of "Mass Dick" in
generosity or anything else that is
kind and noble. And then there is
his right bower, George Hamilton,
who is hard to beat on any kind
of .a truck that is smooth and level.
TllK F let a .—This popular
steamer under tho command of
Capt J. C. Mitchell and with Mr.
Jas. Robhins in the offico reached
here on Thursday with a good trip
and goes down to-day at 12 M.
Not to be out done in generosity
Capt. Mitchell will take down with
him Yaeger's Brass Band who have
been up iu attendance at the Fair
without any charge to the Associa
tion. Capt Mitchell is ever ready
to oblige his patrons and Mr. Rob
ins as clerk is willing and does give
himself any amount of trouble to
attend to all their wauts. They de
sire to make a living in this trade
and we hope to see tliem succeed.
Wo have been a warm supporter of
Capt. Mitchell and the Fleta since
lie gave himself the extra trouble
and expense to put our delegates to
Baton Rouge in time lor tho State
Convention. We are sure that
Capt Mitchell and his boat will get
i fair share of tho public patronage.
ii any body can find us a more
'••lever gentleman than liobiü» wo
.vouhl like .•see bun.
Capt. .Totin Hienn.—W o are
glad to welcome this old veteran
back into the trade in which ho has
been for so long and we are proud
to make it known that on his lirst
trip with the Garry Owen, ho did
one of those generous acts for
which he is noted and which have
endeared him to our people. The
Garry Owen brought up tho Brass
Baud from New Orleans for the
Fair Association and although their
passage amounted to Eighty dol
lars, he did not charge the Associa
tiou a cent for it. This is jnst like
our old Capt. Johu Hienu and we
record the fact that he may get the
credit that is due him for hie gener
osity. The Garry Owen went down
on Monday last with a fine load of
cotton, which shows that the peo
pie of this trade have not forgotten
their old time frieud.
While speaking of the Capt. we
aro reminded that the "People's
New Orleans and Grand Ecore
Packet Company" is uow fully or
ganized by the election of efficient
officers among whom we see that
Maj. Gilbert L. Hall is the Presi
dent. The Company is uow a per
mauent institution.
Cooshatta Prisoners .—We aro in
debted to Capt. Geo. C. Hamilton of
the Steamer Sabine, for the follow
ing list of the prisoners arrested by
tho Uuited States troops at Coushat
ta, who are now hold by them :
C. P. Bullock, H. R. Jones,—Ab
ney, — Love, J. F. Stephens, Geo.
Caw thorn. W. B. Clark, B. C. Lee,
P. LeBroat, Wm. Ames, R. M. Scr
sey, D. M. Giddings, Dr. J. M. Brown
and four others whoso names aro not
furnished ns.
This is a nice little electioneering
game on the part of the government.,
and that the United States govern
ment should thus interfere in our
State affairs to carry the approach
ing élection for the thieves and rob
bers who aro seeking to perpetuate
their rule for two years moro, is an
outrago for which there can be no
excuse, and for which there mnst be
some speedy check or State govern
ment will be the flimsiest of pretexts
and the barest of fraud*.
Registration .— T h e registra
tion is now over and those who
have failed to secure their papers,
can now have the satisfaction of
knowing that they have lost their
votes and helped to secure our de
feat, if defeat awaits ns. The total
registered is 3136.
A Puzzle.
Spellers of ;»11 grades and nges will find
the attempt to write the following story
from dictation, an interesting puzzle. A
lady who was sure sliu could win the Weh
st.er' Unabridged offered ns a prize. In case
she sucoeded, missed only 22 of the 99
hard words. A professor of languages,
who prideil himself on his knowledge of
orthography, missed 28. It is possible
that our typo may not put them all up
correctly. Let us see if some of our readers
can detect tho errors Webster is the
standard :
The most skillful ganger I ever knew
was a inaligncd'cobbler, armed with apon
iard, who drove a peddler's wagon, using
a mullein stalk as an instrument of coer
cion, to tyrannize over his pony shod with
calks, lie was a German Saddnceo, and
had a plithisicky catarrh, dipt.heria, and
tho billions intermittent erysipel.au. a
certain Sibyl- with the sobriquet of "Gyp
sy," went into ecstacies of cacliinnation
at seeing liini measure a Imsliel of peas
and seperato saccharine tomatoes from n
heap of peeled potatoes without dyeing of
singeing lio ignitilile qneno which her
wore, or becoming paralyizcd with a hem
orrhage. Lifting her eyes to the ceiling of
the cupola of the capitol, to conceal her
unparalleled embarrassment, making a
rough courtesy, and not harrassing him
with invstifying, rarefying and stupefy
ing innuendoes, she gave him a couch, a
bouquet of lilies, mignonette, and fuchsias
a treatise on mnemonics, a copy of the
Apochrypha in hieroglyphics, daguerreo
types ot Mendelssohn, and Koscinsco, a
kaleidoscope, a dram phial of ipecacuauha,
n teaspoon fill of naptha for deleble purpo
ses, a ferule, clarionet, souio licorice, a
siircinglo, a carnclian of symmetrical pro
portions, a chronometer with movable
liai an co wheel, a box of dominoes and a
catechism. The ganger, who was also a
trafficking rectifier, and a parishioner of
mine, preferred a woolen surtout (his
choice was referablo to a vacilating occa
sionally occurring idiosyncrasy,t wofully
uttered this apothegm: "Life is checkered;
but schism, apostacy, herosy and villainy
jail be punished." Tho Syliil apologiz
iugly answered: "There is ratably an al
locable difference between a confcrrable
ellipsis and a trsyllabic diaeresis.
A Hard Customkr.—" I have a
small bill against you," said a perni
cious-looking collector, as ho entered
the store of one, who had acquired the
character of hard customer. " Ye3,
sir, a very fine day, indeed," %vas tho
reply. '• I am not speaking of the
weather, but your bill," replied the
collector, in a loud key. " It would bo
better if wo had a little rain." Con
found the rain !" continued the collec
tor, a;;d raising his voice, added,
Have you the money to pay thi.;
bilH" 11 Beg your pardon, I'm hard
iiiiL.;. I 've uiaJ it •> l J le not to
lend my funds to strangers, and I really
don't recognize you." "I'm collector
for the Daily Extinguisher newapafier,
sir, nnd I have a hill against yon,"per
sisted the collector, at tho top of his
voice, producing the bill anil thrusting
it in the faco of Iii» debtor., " I've de
termined to indorse bills for no one;
you may put tho bill back into your
pocket-book; I really can't indorse
it." "Confound your indorsement!
" Will you pay it?" You'll pay it, no
doubt, sir ; but there'* always a risk
about tlieso matters, you know. So I
must decline it." "Tho money must
bo mine to-day I" " Oh, yes, ninety
days; bnt I would not iudorsn n biil
for you at n week ; so get out of iuy
store. It is aeldom that I am
pressed upon fur au indorsement, even
by a friend ; on tho part of a stranger,
sir, it is inexplicable. Do not force
me to put you out ; leave the premises."
Tho bill was returned to tho feting
uisher office indorsed : " So dreadfully
deaf that ho could not understand."
