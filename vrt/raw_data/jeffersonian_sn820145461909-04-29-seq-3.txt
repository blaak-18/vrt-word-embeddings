Corn Production in the Southern State s
"By Hon. Hart in V. Calbin.
Mr. Editor: No one can question
the statement that Georgia and her
fig’ht strictly cotton • growing sisters,
namely, the Carolinas, Alabama. Mis
sissippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma
and Arkansas, have not done since the
War between the States, are not to
day doing, just what each and all of
them could be and should be doing in
corn production.
I't is true, gratifyingly true, that
there has been this season a wider in
• quiry for the best varieties of field
corn than at any time in the past
quarter of a century. This is a very
encouraging feature in the situation.
It signifies closer personal attention
to the corn crop this year than has
been customary. The awakening,
though it may control v nly twenty
farmers in one hundred, will result in
great good. It is a matter on which
congratulation may properly be ex
changed; for the leaven in the meas
ure of meal will work.
I venture the declaration that a
larger acreage will be planted to
Marlboro corn this season than in any
of the past five years.
What is Marlboro corn? It is a
prolific field corn —adapted to any
portion of the South. Last year, at
the Georgia Experiment Station,
Marlboro, fertilized with 354 pounds
of a mixture of acid phosphate, cot
ton meal, muriate of potash and ni
trate of soda, per acre, yielded 39.6
bushels of shelled corn an acre.
Any seed of Marlboro for sale ?
No; nor does the writer know of
whom seed may be purchased.
Note, if you please, that the corn
was liberally fertilized. It w T as care
fully cultivated. It was given that
degree of attention that is possible
on every farm in Georgia and in every
cotton State.
I suspect that the average reader
of your deservedly popular newspaper
would challenge a statement to the
effect that the cotton States which I
have named, in addition to growing
an immense cotton crop in 1907, pro
duced quite 40 per cent more corn
than Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wis
consin, Minnesota, Kansas, North Da
kota, South Dakota, Colorado and
New Mexico. It is a fact.
Here are the figures:

Georgia 57,538,000

Kansas 155,142,000
North Dakota 3,080,000
South Dakota 47,175,000
Colorado 2,608,000
New Mexico 1,218,000
Total 402,628,000
A difference, you observe, in favor
of the nine strictly cotton States, of
138,475,000 bushels.
The foregoing is not intended as *n
invidious comparison. The facts de
veloped carry a lesson of great im
portance to the farmers of the cotton
States. It is a lesson of suggestion
and a word of encouragement.
The farmers are being advised con
tinually to reduce their cotton acre
age and increase their corn acreage.
The comparison just made prompts an
inquiry as. to the comparative corn
acreage in the two groups of States
named.
The tact is that the corn acreage of
the cotton States in 1907 was 30,768,-
000 acres; that of the other’ nine
States, 15,564,000 acres. The corn
acreage of the nine cotton States is
quite double the acreage to corn in
the nine non-cotton States. So, the
acreage is large enough for all pur
poses.
This brings us face to face with
the one thing that is lacking in our
plans as to corn production. It is a
factor of supreme importance—a
high average yield per acre.
The nine non-cotton States men
tioned were selected for comparison
for the reason that their general
average yield of corn per acre was
about the same as the general average
yield of the United States; the farmer
being 25.9 bushels, and the latter
26.8 bushels.
The very mention of 17.4 bushels, as
the general average yield per acre of
corn in the nine strictly cotton States
cited, is clearly to indicate the stan
dard of excellence to which we should
and must attain, that is, 25 bushels
per acre.
The acreage of 1907 should not be
increased, but, by a wise and free
use of high grade fertilizer per acre,
and the practice of the most approved
cultural methods, the average yield
should be brought up to the point in
dicated.
It is a lamentable fact that, in the
matter of corn production, we have
been trying to “make bricks without
straw/’
Each year we buy fertilizer with an
open purse, but our practice has been,
and still is, to use the material too
sparingly—not applying per acre so
much as 60 pounds. Think of 60
pounds of a fertilizer in connection
with an application of 354 pounds or
even 200 pounds per acre. How ex
ceedingly uneconomical I
And yet, in spite of this suicidal
policy, Georgia increased her yield
per acre, between 1902 and 1907, 44.4
per cent. That is, she worked up
from a beggarly 9 bushels to 13
bushels average per acre.
That is an awfully poor record, but
it tells of great possibilities; pro
vided, our farmers take hold in the
right spirit.
I want to impress on the minds of
your readers the pertinency of facts
as to the average yield per acre. I
do not know a more effectual way in
which to do this than by placing in
juxtaposition the average yield of
each of the State under considera
tion.
For example: North Carolina, 16.5;
Pennsylvanit, 32.5; South Carolina,
15.1; Michigan, 30.1; Georgia, 13.0;
Wisconsin, 32.0; Alabama, 15.1; Min
nesota, 27.0; Mississippi, 17.0; Kan
sas, 22.1; Louisiana, 17.5; North Da-
Jeffersonian
kota, 20.0; Texas, 21.0; South Da
kota, 25.5; Oklahoma, 24.4; Colorado,
23.5; Arkansas, 17.2; New Mexico,
29.0.
When felicitating one another on
our climate and soil and sunny skies,
would it not be worth while to study
the facts presented by the foregoing
figures ?
It is not remotely necessary to issue
a propaganda in favor of buying fer
tlizer in any cotton State. We buy
them without limit, almost. We buy
them because it is absolutely impos
sible to farm without them. The
necessity is to educate, to induce, to
persuade, the great mass of fertilizer
purchasers to use the material with
an open hand, intelligently.
If the average application of high
grade fertilizer per acre, in these cot
ton States, could be brought up from
less than 60 pounds to the moderate
quantity even of 200 pounds per acre,
with fairly good attention to the
quality of seed used, new and more
spacious cribs would be required on
nearly every farm next autumn.
