and w I will tell you.n
The politic li situation just now
is pecitliar. It is unex.unplcd in
the history of the United States.
Its phases, its ramifications and its
complications are endless. And
t the l',loplists hold the key to them
a. all ! The allied forces of reform
. are no*' engaged in a death strug
d gle with the most formidable com
t. bination of men that was ever or
e ganized to gain power and empire.
z. Ihe latter is organized, compact
o and aggressive. It is confident of
e victory. not so much on account
it of its inherent strength, though
rt that is very great, as because of
r- dissensions and apparently irrec
t oncilable antagoni-ms among its
opponents. If these differences
Scould be settled, if the discords
tl could be removed, and the allied
a forces marshalled in solid array,
a there would be an alignment for a
battle royal, atitanic conflict, such
as is seldom seen among the chil
dren of men. What is the weak
spot, the disturbing element, that
prevents this union of forces? It
ris the result of a tactical mistake
at the beginning of the contest.
A blunder was made at Chicago,
recognized then as bad, but every
'lay siuce growing more and more
apparent as fatal if it cannot be
e removed.
It may as well be understood
Snow as later, that an inoongruous
r addition to the Chicago ticket en
a dangers if it does not insure its
i, defeat. There is a dead weight at
o tached that threatens to sink the
- ship. There is a grain of sand in
e the eye that must be removed to
secure clear vision. In other
- words, Sowall's withdrawal is a
9 condition precedent to Bryan's suc
cess. The dead-wood, the broken
spars, the damaged sails and the
lecrepit masts must hbe cut away
h to enable the vessel to float. Shall
such rubbish be allowed to encum
a ber and crush a greatcause? Shall
so small a thing as the gratification
of one man's ambition be allowed
s to stand in the way of the aspira
tions of millions? Shall the one
fatal error of an unexampled cam
paign not be corrected ? We think
we voice the sentiments of every
true man and woman in the reform
cause, when we answer emphatical
Sly, No!
I But how shall it be done, how
f can it be done? The.Populists hold
Sthe key of the situation. Upon
t their wisdom, their courage, their
devotion to principle, depends the 1
accomplishment of a grand and
gliorious result. They must rise
up as one man and demand Se
wall's removal andt Watson's sub- I
- stitution in his place. If insisted
upon boldly, bravely, persistently
it will be granted. No one who
understands the situation can doubt
it for a moment. When the mana- i
gers of the allied forces, especial- I
i ythe commanders of the larger
wing of the army, see that "rebel
lion is afoot" and that Achilles re
Sfuses to marshall his troops for the
fray unless his rights are granted, I
there is no doubt whatever that his
idemands will be acceded to. The a
Populist wing of this army is in
dispensable to success. Not a state
west of Ohio can be won without
them. With them is victory; C
without them is ingloriousi defeat.
And nothing stands in the way but
one man, and he one who ought not
to have been put there and who has
no.right to remain there.
Indaa is an immensely impor
tant factor in this momentous v
movement for principles and for t
power. She oocupies a pivotal 3
point. She is the keystone of the
arch, the main girder of the bridge C
which leads to the promised land. F
She is shortly to spealk, and if she
pemks in no uncertain tone, it will
e the beginning of the end of the
most interesting and important po-I
litical deoaouement ever seen in
the politics oh the world. Talk E

at This means something, It
nr means much. It mean every

Others will follow. No fear about
that. A right chord Struck here
will resound all along the line, put
htcourage a'nd hope into the hearts
of our discouraged followers, and
n throw the splendor of sunlight
over the long line of devoted Pop
ulist host. The effect will be mag
ical. Simply to state our demands
is to gain them, Already the oth
er side is wavering, and it will not
take much of a shake to bring the
fruit down. Sewall is more than
l half off the ticket already.
Before next week ends he will
be clear off the ticket, if only our
Speople, who have the cards in their
hands. have the nerve to play
et them. There is no danger of the
cause collapsing, as some think,
t There is no danger of confusion be
i ing caused, or additional discard.
f Every man who is now for Bry
an will remain for him after the
change in the line of battle. All
the men who are for Bryan and
Watson, but not for the former
1 alone, and not at all for his present
running mate, will be for the
w' hole ticket with redoubled zeal
andl invincible ardor. The ticket
w- will he strengthened, not weaken
k ed. No votes will he lost, but
it many gained. The allied forces
[t will at last. and for the first time,
e be molded together in a solid phal
t anx. The army of reform will
stretch from ocean to ocean with
out a break and without a sullen
y soldier. Populists of the United
e States, more especially Populists
of Indliana, a grand, a magnificent,
a supreme opportunity awaits you.
A glittering prize lies immediate
Is ly before you. Will you have the
foresight, the wisdom, the nerve to
reach out and grasp it?
e As We See It.
r It must he plain to every Popu
a list that if our party-ames a mi
nority of electors in a State-
n they are for Bryan and Watson,
1e and the majority are for Bryan and
SSoewall we are defeated before the
-. fight begins, Do as we have done
11 in Georgia. Keep your electors
n in the field until Sewall has come
d down. When you do this you
L don't ask for anything, you simply
. demand it, and when you demand
k it you will get it, because you can
y force it.-People's Party Paper.
The above is from Tom SWat
son's paper, and no doubt written
by himself. No one can contro
d vert the force of the argument or
n the correctness of the facts as stat
r ed. If the Populists all over the
e Union had acted in accordance
e with the surestions in the above
Sarticle, there is little :doubt. that
- long before this Sewall would have
1been withdrawn and Watson sub
Sstitutoh. It is nonsense to sup
pose that the democrats would have
- rendered their own defeat certain
- by refusing to yield the vice presi
r dency to the Populists, The way
to get Sewall off is not by endors
a ing electors pledged to vote for I
Shim, but by insisting that no such I
e endorsement will take place under
s any circumstances. As far as the a
question of principle in concerned,
it is as much violated by voting t
for one Sewall as a dozen. In In- a
diana, for instance, how does it !
t help matters by yielding three
Populist electors? If Populists
vote for twelve Sewall electors
Sthey mightas well vote for the I
Swhole fifteen, so far as the ques- 5
dtion of principle is concerned.
They are opposed to Sewall be- '
cause hestands for all that the
Populists abhor, and to vote for a
him isto stultify themselves as well I
as give the lie to every principle !
they profess. Such being the case,
how can any Populist vote for a
Sewall elector? The fact that in
doing sohehas a chance to vote
for a few Watson electors doesn't
helpthe matter. If he votes for
Watson electors he votes for his
principles. Bt e sootn as hre pass
esover toa Sewall elector he is d
voting squarrly against his princi
ples. Moreover, his vote ean't
Ipossib)y bring about Watson' i
