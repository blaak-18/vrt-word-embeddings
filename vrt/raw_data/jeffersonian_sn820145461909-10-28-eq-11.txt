OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
A LIBERAL EDUCATION.
I have been a silent admirer of the
Jeffersonian for a long time. Papa
takes the Jeffersonian and Magazine,
and likes them fine. I hope Mr.
Watson will be president after Mr.
Taft. Papa said if I would read the
papers and magazines published by
Mr. Watson, they would educate me
almost as quick as going to school.
I will ring off, wishing much success
to Daddy Jim and the members of the
Post-Card Club.—Bonnie Porterfield,
Colbert, Ga.
FROM TEXAS.
Here I come again. Papa takes
both the Jeffersonian and the Maga
zine, and we think they are great.
I am fourteen years old, have blue
eyes and light hair. Our school will
start at Post Oak on October 18th,
and I sure will be glad. lam in the
seventh grade. Well, I will close,
with love to all.—Dottie Wood, Hol
land, Texas.
A FLORIDA INVITATION.
I thought I would write you a few
lines, as my papa takes the Jeffer
sonian and has been a constant read
er of Mr. Watson’s literature ever
since I could remember; and he says
that Mr. Watson is the greatest man
in America. He never rests, when
he gets a new paper, until he has
read everything in it; and I like to
read his writings myself. I was read
ing yesterday of the life of Joan of
Arc. It made me shiver to read it.
In found the story of it in the Histo
ry of France, written by Mr. Watson.
I am a little girl, fourteen years old,
and weigh 112 pounds. I go to
school, and am in the seventh grade.
I live in De Soto county, Florida.
My papa is a farmer and orange
grower, and we are beginning to have
plenty of them to eat now. Don’t
some of you Post-Card Club want to
come and stay with me a while, and
help me eat oranges? I also invite
you, Daddy Jim. Well, as I am a
stranger, I will close. —Bessie Rob
erts, Lily, Fla.
A GOOD COTTON-PICKER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I received your
paper, and appreciated it very much.
I have read it all over, and like it so
well that I want to subscribe for it.
I have read so many nice letters, I
thought I would try again. I have
four brothers and two sisters. I can
do any kind of farm work. I have
picked 2,74 7 pounds of cotton this
season. I hope to win some of your
prizes. I will ring off until another
time, if this escapes the waste-basket.
—Howard L. Smith, R. F. D. 3, Lex
ington, Ga.
A LITTLE HOUSEWIFE.
I am a little Georgia girl, eleven
years of age. My papa takes the
Jeffersonian and the Magazine, and I
like to read the boys’ and girls’ let
ters. I help my mother in the kitch
en and in the house, too. I bring in
the wood and draw water and bring
it in the kitchen. I can cook a little,
too. My aunt is with us now; she is
quilting for us. She has come from
Jeffersonian
Oliver to live with my grandmother.
I have three sisters and five broth
ers. My papa is a farmer. I have
one sister married. Well, Daddy Jim,
I guess I will close for this time.—
Sadie Robbins, Sylvania, Ga.
WANTS TO WIN A PRIZE.
I am a little girl, fourteen years of
age. I want to win the prize this
week, and if I win, please send me
a ring> Papa takes the Jeffersonian,
and I sure do enjoy reading it. I
long for the time for the paper to
come. It did not come for tw r o weeks,
and I sure did miss it. How many
of your boys and girls like the Jef
fersonian? I would like to see more
letters from this small town of Kite.
I like to go to school and study my
books. I am in the fifth grade.—
Zell Claxton, Kite, Ga.
ANOTHER COMPETITOR.
I am only ten years old, and did
not start to school until I was eight
years old. I have just entered the
fifth grade; therefore I don’t feel
competent to correct this letter. I
think I have selected the right one
to correct, although I see “I like it
fine” in another letter. You may find
mistakes in my letter, but I do try to
spell correctly. My last teacher said
I used splendid English. I have one
brother and one sister. This is my
first attempt to write to any paper.
I enjoy reading the letters in the
Post-Card Club. —Your little friend,
Cecile Crawley, Barnett, Ga.
WELCOME—COME AGAIN.
Dear Daddy Jim: —As I have not
seen anything from this part, thought
I would write a short piece. I will
try to tell you boys and girls where
I live in the dear old State of Ala
bama. Come on, all you boys and
girls from Georgia, as I used to live
there, but I like my home in Ala
bama best. I live on old Sand Moun
tain. Say, Daddy Jim, you and the
cousins must come to see me, and see
where I live. Papa takes the Jeffer
sonian, and we all like to read it.
We all think Mr. Watson is doing a
grand work, and wish him success.
Long may he live to carry on the
great work he has started out to do.
I hope our next president will be Mr.
Watson, for he is doing more to help
the poor of our country than any
other man in the United States. If
I am welcome this time, may come
again.—Your new friend, Florence
Smith, R. F. D. 2, Walnut Grove,
Ala.
OUR PRIZE CONTEST.
Letters of correction are coming
in fast. Most of the writers have
caught the obvious errors, such as
mixing up Georgia, Alabama and
Florida; three and three makes six,
instead of five; and the common mis
takes in spelling; but not a single
letter, so far received, has made all
the corrections called for. We will
wait one more week, before awarding
the prizes, so as to give a chance to
our little friends who live a long way
off; and the prize-winners and the
corrections will be published next
week.
