The Courts.
MIuch stress Is laid upon "law and
- law-abiding," by many people who
cr claim to be conservative; which term
by-the-by, is now a mere figure of
speech, fall of fine sound, signifying
i nothing. And when gross ingjustice
and outrage is done the citizen, by
Sthe partizan clap-traps now ruling as
statesmen, upon their rights and liber
ties, they are asked in accents mild
in to resort to the courts, to appeal to
Sthe "majesty of the law."
] This talk is not only confined to
Do the enemies of good government, but
D is indulged in to some extent by oth
D ers, whose position and understand
on ing would leatd us to believe better of
r them. They prate of lawyers and
judges, and courts and juries, as if we
,e of Louisiana, were enjoying a sye
tem of government, honorable and
honest, as if under the Kellogg usur
- pation there were three sorts of pow
a er; the legislative, the executive, in
respect to things dependent on the
d law of nations, and the executive, in
e regard to things that depend on the
civil law, when these same persons
well know that with us, that point is
reached, which Montisquien said,
Du "when the onelegislative, and two exe
entive," being united in the same hndr.
"there can be no liberty."
We have edifices here, dedicated to
. justice, but justice being blind, has
" not as yet fumnd an entrance therein;
our courts in fact, are, generally
v speaking, a farce of the first water.
* The invitation extended to attend
*. these exhibitions ot puppets, set up
r. imitation of courts, is insulting to
reason, degrading to patriotism, and
" well nigh ruinous to litigants. The
Supreme Court of the United States,
the highest judicial tribunal in the
land, has pronounced upon the stand
ing of the individual who disgra:ces
the ermine of the Chief Judiciary of
Louisiana, Luilling.
He is said, by that tribunal, to be a
trickster ind a thief; that he colluded
with rascals to defraud the State be
; fore his own court. In all matters
political, these fellows sit upon the
l- bench looking as wise as sleepy owls,
and then, decide for party. No law,
_ no justice, is looked for, and yet we
are asked to appeal to courts. We
are led to these reflections by the re
cent acts of our(?) Parish Judge, who
has put lawyers and clients in a per
r feet. stew by his recent outrageous
decisions, and bad we not an honest
andt upright District Judge, (we say
this in no. sphit of compliment) our
citizens would be in a nice condition.
This Parish Jack-snipe, was elect
a ed to the bench and assumed the er
milne upon the ground of his riding a
one-horse Cavalry raid upon Cloutier
ville, during the day of election in
1874, and running off from the polls
poor white men from the hills, by
*threats of arrest. For this gallant
s act (?) he was thus rewarded, and to
l day he exhibits the same capabilities
- as a Judge that lie did upon that day
as a patriot; he has the same regard
Sfor law and its forms as he then did
for the rights of American citizens.
S His decisions with regard tothe
Srights of property are uniaue, and
Swhere facts are wanting, he is ready
to supply tkem. y i~nference. His land
decisions are hearty,'sand if a triend
is up' to prove his title, which calls
for a iach which is'dnt there, he has
not the least compuaoetion to giving
Shim a slice of some oneelse's to make
it up, and last ofall, hir constitution
al exuberance caps the climax, for
when he finds a hiatus thereina, upon
the question of his jurisdiction in a
claim of *1500 or more, prinapal and
Sinterest, he pops in a clause to suit
the timies. Thus we bave a Judge
I that can not only decide laws, bat he
-can make them; and not only that,
but constitutions are not too heavy
for him to tackle. To sum up, this
Swarr'ior-statesman Judge is equal to
any emergency.
If elections are to be carried, give
him Cavalry in blue; if law points are
- to be decided, he does not want any
- thing, as he has a way of his own,
[ quite new and refreshing, to those
who have made ita point to read long,
that deep study. .

n giving, or being forced to give, which

i The Bulletin, speaking of thl.iigh
handed outrage, says:
Thus crops out the intention of the
r present Board of School Directors
'"amalgamation, Africanisation or ra
d illatio,," is their motto, and they in
h' solently defy the people whose mooney
;o supports the schools, but who are

The facts as related above were ob
tained from the young ladies who
a were compelled to leave the school,
whose names we have, and whose ac
tion everybody must not only apl.

t One bane under which we labor, is
the number of officials in our State
r which are elective, and to curtail the
number demands the serious atten
- tion of our wisest men. We have
560 Parochial officers, 38 Judicial
{ (District), 148 State, legislative, 6
State otficials, making a total of752
S.officials; this does not include ward
s officials, and exeuentive appointees;
Stax collectors, parish attorneys, par
islh surveyors, auctioneers, &c., nor
municipal officers, whose name is le
Sgeon.
These all enjoy special stalls in the
Spublic crib, and fully one-half are
useless. Instead of cutting down
salaries, the first tlling is to lop off
Sofficials; one-half the. expenses to the
I State can be sarved in that way alone,
to say nothing in the way of reduced
Sfees and salaries,'aits well as executive
Sand legislative expenses, contingeot,
we believe they are called.
SIn Louisiana, not less than ten
thousand able bodied politicians, live
Sby office: alone, a thousand are too
Smany. As a great many of thlese of
Sficers are not provided for by consti
tutional enaetment,: the General As
Ssembly can make a scattering of them.

What must the monarchical world
think of a republican president who
would talk of forcing religious ques
tions upon his people simply to se
cure his own tenure of office. Grant
is certainly growing worse as he grows
older ; he is much more susceptible
to the inofluence of bad men now, than
heretofore, had if lie has full swing
we do not know what will become of

Uncovering Too Early.
Those journals it our State that
r represent the party of great moral
I ideas, (the tag end of it, however,) are
s busily engaged in uncovering the
maskel battery of success for next
year.
In doing so they make fatal ad
missions. In speaking of Myers and
Shis school fund, which our readers
will remember is sho,rt and which has
been "fixed up" by this quondom tes
tifier by the echibition to Brown of
I rourclers--the New Orleans thieves'
own says:
"In the good old days the parish
treasurers generally deemed it a re
ligious duty to rake in the small fund
for party purposes, and stand off the
Yankee school teachers with scrip,
slow notes, a ride on a rail, or any
thing but money."
i But now this is all changed. Myers
r has made a showing to the satisfac
I tion of Brown and the State organ,
f and the blasted taxpayers can go to
I old Nick for comfort. Myers, in the
- mean time, "goes on" as treasurer,
4 plays the same part in the drama,
t but pronisses "not to do naughty any
I more."
- That is the sum total of the reform (?)
I we are to get and if we dont like it,
e why, we can pack up and "pull out."
Another sheet in speaking of Natchi
toches parish and the acts of the wllte
people makes equally fatal admissions.
It says:
a "There was a time. probably, when
- people felt that confiscation would be
. the consequense of such exhobitant
taxation as prevailed, and their
homes and liresides swept from them,
a at the bidding of a tax collector-but
- that time has passed-and God grant
3 it may never come again, which ac
s ted as an incentive to rise in their
I might to fill the evil destroyer-but
now when a redueion from 8 per cent
to 141 mills, almost a nominal tax is
had, the people are satisfied, and care
I not whit are the offliials, whether Re
publicans or Demnocrats, so they are
honest."
That word "probably" is neatly
put, but it fails to cover the opening.
lHero then, we have it plainly stated,
that the whites had cause for their ac
tion last year; that their action was
tight and proper, but they must con
tent themselves with that and noth
ing more. We are not aware that
these journals speak for the white
people, in fact we know they do not;
in view of which fact, we take the ex
pression that, the people are satisfied
and care not who are officials, wheth
er Republicans or Democrats," for
what it is worth.
The question "the people" will ask
is this: Who brought about the
present calm from spoilation t Was
it not the action of the white people
that forced, unwillingly, the radicals
to this position ? Most assuredly,
Iyes! To be conevinced of thlat we
simply inquire, would the radical par
ty have brought about these reforms
if allowed to go on unchecked I Cer
tainly not ! Therefore, "thle people"
will not allow radicals to make a vir
tue of necessity. And then the
"cheeky" part conies in when it is
stated that we are to have all these
reforms, all this honest conduct of
government from the same persoe twho
are the tieves of the past. The whole
proposition is simply ridicalous; will
not deceive any one: in fact the early
uncovering must prove fatal to the
cause of waning radicalism.
Its patty have not the attributes
necessary to make a good govern
Iment. They are all dishonest or ig
norant, and of such material, nothing
can be manufactured. 1876 will show
these people precisely what a quick
sand they have built their hopes upon.
Kellogg and his party parade the
name of Col. George Williamson, for
Governor, on the Radical ticket in
this State next year.
Well, what of it ! Williamson will
only lend support to the same thieves
Kellogg now does; that's all. A saint
pn the Radical ticket for chief mag
istrate of this State, will, if elected,
let in the same iold bummers that have
disgraced the State for the past eight
years. Williamson cannot get any
more conservative votes than Kellogg,
or any other radical; less we think.
If he doubts it let him try.
Confederate Democrats and
Loyal Whigs. Those are the
names given the whites of Louisi
ana by the New Orleans Bepubli
can.
If one whig could be induced to
"go over," wouldn't there be hea
vy rejoicing in radical camps. By
the way, we see that the Southern
republican party of iew Orleans
is assuming large proportions.
Are they the "independent men,"

Black Friday.
Henry Nicholson, who, it will be
remembered, with his brother George,
was found guilty of the murder of the
Peddler, in Red River parish, was ex
ecuted at Coushatta, on Friday, 19th
inst.
Before leaving the prison he evine
I ed the utmost coolness, took a drink
of whisky, eat raisins and candy, as
if bent upon enjoying all the sweets
of life upon the mof.ent of his giving
.it up.
UPON LEAVING THE JAIL
he walked with a firm and steady step
to the scaffold, ascending the ladder
without assistance. But at this juneo
tore, when upon the drop, his
COURAGE FORSOOK l IUO .
Before he left the cell be talked
freely of the murders charged against
him. He denied having killed Mar
cus Young. Said it was Gus. Bird
and Hinton, but he acknowledged
PLUNDERING TIlE MAN
after lie had been killed by these par
ties.
As usual with all convicted mur
derers, lie had much to
SAY OF BEING PERSECUTED
and called upon God to witness the
truth of his statements, implicating
many men as the cause of his being
hung. These statements against
good citizens, are not credited, of
course, but go to show the character
of the man.
He spoke but little while upon the
drop, and at a
FEW MINUTES OF 12 O'CLOCK
the drop fell, and Henry Nicholson
paid the penalty of his crimes with
out a struggle.
After hanging eleven minutes life
was pronounced extinct.
The brother, George, made his es
cape, but was killed by the Sheriffs
possee in attempting to recapture
him.
The maudlin sympathy of radical
journals is always extended to crimi
nals, but for society they have but
little to say; perhaps, for the reason
that society has placed their conduc
tors within the same pale as the law
has the criminal.
In Louisiana, this philanthropy is
more marked for the reason that the
radicals themselves are unpunished
violators of the law. The fact of Maj
James, working convicts upon the
New Orleans Pacific road. The St.
James entinel says, that the system
is "cruel, unjust, nnwise and danger
ous;" this glittering display of ad
jectives smacks of the "blue stock
ing, or nosed," Puritan of Massach.
setts.
Punishment for crimes against so
ciety is one thing, and cruelty is an
other-conviets can be pnmshed and
not be treated with cruelty. They
are condemned to hard labor, and
those who "work out their sentence"
outside the prison walls, are more
happy, more contented, than thost
who are the silent machines of the
Penitentiary.
There is a great difference of opin
ion as to the proper system of roles
and regulations for prisons and pris
oners. This difference of opinion
has led to much diseussion and to
many experiments all, however, tend
ing to punish, and in that punishment
to alleviate a much as possible the
suffering of' the convict, and it has
been demonstrated, the silent inactivi
ty is the most cruel, unwise, unajast
and rigorous of all punishments.
What do these St. James sages pro
pose to do with that class of criminals
who have no capacity to learn trades ?
Kellogg makes no bones in display
ing his style. He pardons them by
wholesale. This, we suppose, would
be amply sufficoient to satisfy outrag
ed Bovee. Simply find the prisoner
guilty and let him go, even without
the comfort of a cold potato.
We have had about a sufficiency of
this kind of philanthrophy, cheap
tinselled virtue, exhibited during the
past fifteen years. This is the school
of radicalism; to be generous with
other people's money; to be merciful
at the.expense of society, law and
order. Something of the style of
emancipating the negro belonging to
the Soothern man, after they had dis
posed of their own for a considera
tion. This might be further illus
trated by the "bib making" for Hot
tentot babies; the "plug hat" manu
factored for Sandwich Islanders,
while at home millions are naked and
starring.
Yankee philanthropy has become
proverbial, is known to the civilzed
world as a trick, a sham and a cheat.
We have enough of it abroad, God
knows enough of it with stale flour
and poor beef, to the poor Indian;
don't attempt it on the prison con
victs. Bather let Kellogg pardon the
whole batch, at least, in that event,
they can be utilisd asu nadieal voters,
or what is better, radical ofce-hol
ders.
If they cannot build railroads with
dirt, wood and iron, they can do it on
paper, and blue, red and green bonds,
you know, are beautiful-to the eye
of the Carrondelet and Wall street,
Shylocks.
Osborn, the Judge of the Rapides
District Coart, has been getting some
well deserved licks from the Dise

Ja. II. Cosgrove, Eq..:
lun: For a year (ending last of
June,) I was favored with the weekly
visits of your interesting add valua
ble paper--The People's Vindicator.
To the kindness of a friend, a partial
resident there, I am indebted for the
favor. And now, though at this late
date, permit me to congratulate you
on the success of the enterprise. while
I hope the circulation may be enlarg
ed with the return of each succeeding
year.
May success crown your efforts, it
the wish of your
Unseen Reader.
Luc NOBLE.
We thank our fair correspondent
for her good wishes, and she can rest
assured the Vindicator will al ways be
found doing its duty to the white
people of Louisiana, without fear,
favor or affection,
We have nevr had the mortifica
tion of an introdttetion to the editor
of the Coushatta Citizen, a hiatus in
life we are not prepared to weep
ocean of tears over. Nevertheless,
from his vagne reply, to certain
"squibs" from this journal, which he
has been getting off, and that manly
appeal le makes to his able bodied
constituents, which can be designated
thusly 0, in his issue of 20 inst., we
hate this to say : When a journal ap
pealing to the support and sympathy
of white people rushes into reprint of
staole eAares against oie of their nam
her, made by rdticba, who, m well as
others, can make charges and not
sustain them, such a person puts him
self in the same situation that that
class occupy.
To as personally theCitizen is noth
ing, we fear not its sqibs, and leave
the public to judge of 'blackguardism
by a simple perusal of its two column
leader referred to. If that is decent
then the judgement of the Citi:en is
considerably "hacked."
Our opinions are plain spoken and
generally to the point, at least those
relating to the Citizes seem to have
been from the way it squirmed. Its
rigmnarole of "taking muskets," of
"compromising" or "curry favor,"
"belong to and are controlled by ring,
cliques, &ce., we leave for those to
understand who can, such we con
sider, however, beyond the possibil
ity of a Southern christian gentleman.
As to your "beer house bully and
political huckstering" why
Let the galled jade wines.
They are certainly gentlemanly (t)
expressions from a "country paper"
to a stranger and will commend them
selves to Southem gestlemea--of your
class.
