OUR POST-CARD CLUB
A PERFECT SPELLER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little school boy, six years old. I
read the children’s letters in The
Jeffersonian, and love so much to
read them. I am always glad when
your paper conies. Maybe you think
I am too small to read, but I am not..
Igo to school to my mamma. Papa
and mamma both teach school. I
started to school last fall, and
haven’t missed a word in my spelling
yet; have not been absent a day, and
always know my lessons. I am in
the second grade, and have thirteen
head marks. Have you any little
boys that can beat that? I have one
brother two years older than I am;
his name is Leon. I can answer
Bertie Moon’s riddles: the first one
is a well, the second one a newspa
per, and the third one is a white dog
running a white cow out of a white
cotton patch. I hope to see my letter
in The Jeffersonian next week. With
best wishes to all, I am your little
friend, H. .J Laney, Fitzpatrick, Ala.
NO COFFIN NAILS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—My papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and I surely do en
joy reading it; not only the children’s
page, but all the rest of Mr. Watson’s
writings. Now, a few lines on cigar
ettes: I think we little girls ought to
form ourselves into clubs and pass
resolutions that we will not allow 7
any young man or boy who smokes
cigarettes (or drinks) to even talk to
us, much less keep our company,—
and stick to it regardless of their
standing. I think our older sisters
made many mistakes by their ways
with the boys. I hope the cousins
will have something to say on this
subject; I am sure Mr. Watson will.
I am a little girl, thirteen years old;
have two brothers and no sisters.
—Your Alabama cousin, Gertrude
White, Rt 4, Collinsville, Ala.
STIFF GOATS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you please
make room in your happy band for a
little West Tennessee girl, eight
years old? My papa is a farmer, and
takes both Jeffersonians. I want to
tell the girls and boys about my stiff
goats. Papa brought four from Mid
dle Tennessee, and now we have
three little kids; had to bring them
in the house to keep them from
freezing, and they are perfect pets.
Sister and I have a time with them.
When they get frightened, or try to
jump, they get stiff and fall down
and stretch out as though they were
dying. Papa says he likes them be
cause they can’t jump, and would not
have any ottier kind. Now I will
answer Bertie Moon’s riddle: First
is a well, second a newspaper, and
third is a white dog running a white
cat out of a white house. The answer
to Weaver Terrell’s riddle is the let
ter L. I will give you ©ne: A man
went to a jailer and asked to see a
friend who was in prison, and on be
ing asked what relation they were he
said: Brothers and sisters have I
none, but this man’s father is my
father’s son; what relation were the
two men? I guess I better close, as
this is my first attempt and I am get
ting scared of the waste basket.—
Nola Melear, Rt 8, McKenzie, Tenn.
SAINT VALENTINE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes an
Illinois girl to join our happy band.
My papa and uncle take The Jeffer
sonian and Magazine, and I enjoy
reading the many letters in the Post-
Card Club. My birthday will be St.
Valentine’s day, and I shall be six
teen years old. Now I will answer
Bertie Moon’s riddles: No. 1 is a
well, No. 2 is a newspaper. I will
ask a riddle; Over on the hill stands
a green house, inside of this a white
house, inside of this a red house, and
inside of this red house live several
black people. Now if any one can
answer this riddle I will send them a
Che Jeffersonian
By DADDY JIM
post-cajfd, and if I answered the
others right, please send me a card.
Daddy Jim, I will close for this time
by asking you all to send me a card
on my birthday. Wishing The Jeffer
sonian much success, Flora McClel
land, Rt 1, Sandoval, 111.
ANOTHER RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—For the first
time, I will make an effort to join
your happy band. My papa takes
both and I’ enjoy read
ing the Post-Card Club. I will an
swer Bertie’s riddle: a well; news
paper; a white cow in a white cotton
patch and a white boy ran her out.
Now I will answer Weaver’s: the let
ter L. I will ask one.: Black I am,
but much admired; comfort man, but
tire horses. Tell me this riddle if
you can.—Edna Amos, Barrington,
Ga.
A STRENUOUS LIFE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the second time. I am still go
ing to school. I will describe myself
this time. I have brown eyes, black
hair, and am freckled. My teacher’s
mother is sick, and she has gone
home, and I am just going from one
room to the other, reciting my les
sons. Sometimes I have to stay in,
but when I do get out I play ball
from then until night. When night
comes, I go home and study my les
sons till bedtime. As I have nothing
to write, I will close with a riddle,
and the first girl or boy to answer
it, I -will send him a post-card: Horn
eat a horn up a high oak tree, if you
can unriddle that you can hang me.
—Warner Watson Blakely, Box 223,
Lanett, Ala.

much love to the children and Daddy
Jim, Annie Jones, Sale City, Ga.

Atlanta’s Youngest
Public Stenographer
w ol
While only a child in years, Earle
Murr, son of Joseph Murr, foreman
of the J. K. Orr Shoe Factory, is con
sidered a stenographic wonder and is
declared to be Atlanta’s youngest
public stenographer.
Though only twelve years old, he
has thoroughly mastered the famous
Chartier system of shorthand, which
he learned at the Bagwell Business
College, and is now public stenogra
pher at the Terminal Hotel. He
writes from fifteen to thirty letters
daily and writes them rapidly and
accurately. He can write shorthand
blindfolded and then read it with
perfect ease.
This young man attended night
school at the Bagwell Business Col
lege and mastered the Chartier sys
tem in three months.
If one so young and only in the
sixth grade can learn this system so
quickly and hold a difficult position
with entire satisfaction, it is con
clusive proof that it is a great im
provement over the old systems, like
Graham, Pitman, Munson, etc., which
contain hundreds of word signs.
Bagwell Business College is the
largest school of its kind in the
State. It also teaches bookkeeping
and all commercial branches. All
graduates are given good positions
as soon as the course is completed.
