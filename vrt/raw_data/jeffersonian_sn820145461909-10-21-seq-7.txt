fortunate in possessing in you such a
master mind and she can ill afford to
ever lose you from her thinkers, her
pioneers and guardians of the public
weal who cry out on the watch-tower
to save the State and nation. You,
like the great men who have pre
ceded you, must be misunderstood
and misrepresented. And your day
—the day when you will pass for
your worth, will be lionized and de
clared great—will come when it is
too late for your ears, for your heart
will be stilled and the “daisies will
be growing at your head and at your
feet.” Despite that, it is great to
live and preach a principle and doc
trine that will save the State and
nation, although men may not ac
cept them until you have passed be
yond “life’s little day.”
So if men are slow to see the truth
and will not accept your labor of love
and self-sacrifice just now, you are
not the first they have rejected. For
there is an inspiration in the words
of Kepler, who said: “I may well
wait a century for a reader, since
God has waited for thousands of years
for an observer like myself.’’ As
well may you wait for followers, for
they are sure to come. You have
builded well your system of govern
ment by the people and some day,
let us believe, they will “come
to themselves” and will drive the
money-mad aristocracy, the predato
ry thieves and demagogues from
power, and justice shall rule in the
heart of the rulers.
You ha've builded well your sys
tem of government; you have fought
those who prostituted positions of
trust for the favored few and heaped
additional loads upon the backs of
the poor; you have told the truth
when error was popular; you have
never deserted principle for office nor
left alone those who followed you
into the thick of the fray. You have
been true. Therefore your place in
history is secure. Men love you now;
when you are gone they will learn to
love you more. Many a warm heart
beats for you now; some day thou
sands will hail you as one of Ameri
ca’s greatest statesmen, and your life
and teachings will be studied as those
of Jefferson.
Pardon the length of this letter;
but praise is not too fulsome where
it is deserved. So I could not desist.
You have my heart in your strug
gle. I was taught to be a Populist
by my father. He is old, but con
tinues to sit at night and read your
Magazine and support you at the
polls.
Trusting you may live long and be
more and more recognized as an apos
tle of truth, I remain,
Sincerely,
W. L. SLIGH.
Martin, Ga., Oct. 8, 1909.
Dear Sir: —This is to ask you to
give in one of the Jeffersonians your
views as to what the main cause is
for such a failure in the foreign mis
sion work, as presented through your
publications and others.
Hoping to soon read your views as
to what you think the main cause for
such failure to accomplish the end
intended, i. e., to Christianize the
heathen.
I think this would interest many
of your readers and probably do
much good. I am
Yours for the truth,
J. F. PIERCE.
Ed. Comment.—l. One reason
why mission work in the Orient
fails to bring about any spir
itual change among those people
is that the missionaries themselves
are lacking in apostolic zeal, unself
ishness and inspiration.
2. The other reason why the task
is hopeless is that the Oriental mind
is so different from ours. We do not
understand the subtle processes of
the Japanese and Chinese brains.
And, on their part, they can imitate
us and acquire the Western civiliza
tion outwardly, but they never really
understand our intellectual and moral
natures. Consequently, the religions
of Mahomet, Buddha and Confucius
suit the Orient. When these people
put on Christianity they do it because
of what they get out of it. When
material benefits cease, the Oriental
returns to the faith of his fathers.
OVER IN ALABAMA.
Dear Sir: —We have a condition in
politics here that seems to me to be
bordering on fanaticism and church
tyranny, and some of our best people
are exhibiting the same spirit that
was exercised in the inquisition and
massacre of St. Bartholomew. Every
Sabbath morning some of the par
sons, with all due deference to the
real minister, are giving us a striking
illustration of the danger of the
church and State government. With
distorted countenances, flaming eyes,
and frothing mouths they swing their
arms, and through innumerable con
tortions of body gradually work them
selves and their audiences up to a •
frenzy and make a state of public
mind that is totally unfit to settle
any question on its true merits. And
so I come to you for advice.
You are aware the trouble arose
over the whisky traffic. Local op
tion was the platform upon which
we elected our governor and legisla
ture. That was tried in several
counties with satisfactory results,
having voted whisky out of Jeffer
son county (Birmingham). But into
this State came Brooks Lawrence,
imported from Ohio, and he grew
impatient with so slow and demo
cratic a measure as local option, and
said, “Let’s have state-wide prohi
bition.” Our solons followed his
leadership, and we, the people, regis
tered no protest, though at the time
some thought it impractical—and
time has proven them right, as whis
ky was sold openly in several of
our counties, and public sentiment
for prohibition was not strong
enough to enforce the law. Rev.
Brooks said the fault was in the law,
that we had not made it tight enough.
So they sought the assistance of one
Judge Weskly, a jurist of some note,
and put him to work. He says that
after having lost many nights of
sleep, ransacking his brain and pour
ing over the dusty records of many
States upon this question—and I sus
pect taking up some of the stripped
off garments of our Puritan fathers—
that he has at last succeeded in
framing the most drastic law ever
put upon the statute books of any
State —commonly known here as the
Fuller liquor law.
In all this legislation, except the
impractical part, they have had my
good will and sympathy, but Brooks
is not satisfied yet, and says we must,
by all means, put prohibition in the
Constitution as a means of forever
dje "Jeffersonian
settling the question in this State.
So, together with his political par
sons, he sought the halls of our cap
itol once more and succeeded in per
suading our solons to order a special
election to be held on November
29th, this year, for the purpose
of putting this amendment in the
Constitution. They could not possi
bly wait until the regular election
next year, but had to have it now, at
an extra expense of $50,000 to the
State. I suspect this undue haste
was occasioned by their fear of the
one hundred thousand voters who
are now’ disfranchised on account of
a failure to pay their poll-tax, and
who can qualify next January.
Now, instead of taking this ques
tion out of politics, as Brooks says it
will, is it not your honest opinion
that those disfranchised voters will
qualify next year and resent this af
front by joining forces with those
who are fighting prohibition, and
bring on a more severe agitation than
ever? Brooks gives as his main rea
son for wanting it in the Constitution
that he is afraid that the whisky
dealers, with their barrels of money,
will succeed in getting a legislature
to repeal the present laws. The
amendment has no punishment at
tached, is not self-operating. Now,
if the whisky-dealers can succeed
in having the present laws repealed,
as Brooks says they can, I want to
know where we will be “at” then,
even with the amendment in the
Constitution? Os course the State
could not license the sale of whisky,
but is it not a fact that it could be
sold without license at every cross
roads store in this State, with no
power to arrest or punish.
The proposed amendment is divid
ed into two parts, Nos. 1 and 2.
No. 1 is just a plain statute that
prohibits the State from licensing the
manufacturing and sale of vinous,
malt, brewed, etc., liquors.
No. 2 reads this way: “Nothing in
the Constitution of the State shall
be construed to prevent the legisla
ture, through its police powers, from
designating place where such liquors
may not be stored or kept.”
No. 1 is the prohibition amend
ment, and No. 2 seems to take some
thing out of the present Constitution.
The inference is that there is some
thing in the Constitution now that
can be construed to prevent the legis
lature from designating our homes
as places where such liquors may not
be stored or kept. So far as liquor
is concerned, I don’t mind that, for
I never keep any in my home any
way, except, probably, my wife may
sometimes have a little bottle for
medical purposes, but the civil lib
erty or the right to keep whisky, or
anything else, that the present Con
stitution allows me to keep is what
I object to giving up.
I can’t see to save my life the ad
vantages to be derived by turning
over to the State our guardianship
in this matter. I can’t see that it is
the office of the law to restrain one
from his own violence; they might
as well prohibit me from keeping a
razor for fear I will cut my own
throat. I always thought that every
free man with a healthy state of mind
was his own best guardian, and I
can’t see that we will advance civiliza
tion or morals by a disgraceful sur
render of the one thing that has
made our young republic the Samson
that it is. But it seems to me that
Samson is about to be shorn of his
*iocks while he slumbers with the
ballot in his hand. Talk about tem
perance! I think we are about to
drink too deep from this jug of pro
hibition, and we may some day wake
up to find the gunstock of liberty
rotted from the barrel at our sides
and nothing but the skeleton of State
happiness lying at our feet.
And in my mind the prohibition
question has resolved itself to this,
that it will prove a failure in any
county unless the citizenship has at
tained moral growth of sufficient
strength to sustain the law. I, for
one, will never agree to a change of
venue on the part of the State in
order to enforce the prohibition laws,
and I think such a course would
prove repugnant to any correct
thinking man. All governments de
rive their just power from the con
sent of the governed.
Your weekly Jeffersonian circu
lates in this State, and I wish you
would answer me through its col
umns and tell me where we are
“at.”
W. M. EILAND.
Ed. Comment: The Fuller act
does not authorize any invasion of
the home unless such home becomes
the lair of the blind tiger. The sec
ond clause of the proposed amend
ment might be construed to mean
that the legislature could designate
private residences as places where
intoxicating liquors shall not be kept;
but the presumption is that the
amendment has no other intent than
to safeguard the Fuller act.
It has been shown that as far
back as 1 852 private dwellings in
Alabama could be searched by officers
if oa'm is made chat th? house con
tains i roperty wbic i is intended for
illegal tse. Even in Georgia, under
the stat-wide prohibition act, liquors
could not be stored and kept for sale
in a private dwelling.
We sometimes send our prohibi
tion orators North; we must not be
surprised when the North returns the
favor. T. E. W.
THIS IS THE WAY TO HELP ME.
Dear Sir: —I have received and
read your attack on Socialism, and I
am pleased to say that I consider it
a grand attack on this fanatical idea,
and I am glad that there is at least
one Georgian who will resent such
attacks as Mr. Robert Hunter made
on the South. And I remember, too,
that it was left to you to reply to
Booker T. Washington’s article con
cerning the progress of the two races,
also to reply to Bishop Turner’s arti
cle in which he called the United
States flag a dirty rag.
Enclosed find check for $5.00 for
which please send your Magazine to
Mr. L. D. Peterson and Mr. W. W.
Strickland, and your weekly to Mr.
R. S. Scott. All these are at Quitman,
Ga., on route No. 7; and extend the
date of subscription up one year for
myself on both publications. Send
us as many knives as you can on
these subscriptions—l mean the
knives with your photograph en
graved on handle.
Wishing you and your publications
even greater success in the future
than you have had in the past, I
remain,
Yours very truly,
