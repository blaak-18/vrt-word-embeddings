Mr. W. R. Williams of Cou

office last Saturday. IHe was here
to see what was the chance to pro
cure some of the cheap corn for
drouth sufferers in his neighbor
hood. Little or nothing having
been done for them up to that
time in Red River parish.
The recent heavy rains washed
out a "dump" on the N. and R.
RB. V. railroad just above town,
which will prevent traffic by rail
between here and Grand Ecore
for a few weekt.
Mr. L. M. Howard, a merchant

Mr. Jbo. H. Henry of ward 10,
was in town Wednesday. He had
a warehouse at Henryville station
destroyed by fire the night before.
Loss about $400, with no insurance.
The fire fiend is severe on him this
season, having destroyed a gin on
bis Grand Ecore place a few months
ago. But his indomitable energy
will not feel it long.

AN APPEAL
To the Populists of the
United States.
We are to be congratulated upon
the growth of our party and the
fact that in the recent election
nearly half the voters of the Union
indorsed much of our platform.
No party ever achieved more bril
liant success in so brief . a time.
Although handicapped in late
Igte campaign, we emerge
from the contest stronger than
ever, Our party alone has a
voting force larger than that which
elected Lincoln and an able, effec
tice reform press of nearly two
thousand papers. We elected
several governors as well as hun
dreds of other State, county, and
town officials. We hold the bal
ance of power in the United States
Senate and have four times as
many congressmen as ever before.
We united with the silver for
ces in the recent campaign,-not
because we believe free coinage of
silver is the solution of the finan
cial problem, but because it would
better existing conditions, would
meet with the least resistance and
become the entering wedge of our
main issue, viz., full legal tender
paper money, issued and regula
ted by the government alone.
Having proved our loyalty at the
polls, we are free to act separate
lyon advanced lines and to em
phasize the real issues our party
was born to advocate. We canniot
in honor lay down ouir arms -and
cease our activity until the war
for which we enlisted has ended
in vidtory for our cause.
The democratic party proposes
to contine the silver fight. Two
pakties cannot exist on tte same
issue. The greater absorbs the
smaller. Therefore, if we remain
mere camp followers of another
party, disintegration will resulti
Our party success alone forced the
deulocrats to adopt the Chicago
platform and nominate a popocrat
for President. Converts made by
party regularity cannot be trusted
with the reforms of the future.

SEPARATE PARTY ACTION PROPOSED.
Ha istory teaches that to achieve
I conservative results, a radical po
sition must be taken, The sub
stitution of our main plank for a
subordinate one, Ais the fighting is
!sue of the next four years, is in
line with the best sentiment of our
lparty and requires no change of
front, no abandonment of princi
ple, no new platform. The main
army merely moves up to occupy
the position held by the skirmish
line.
President Cleveland supplies us
with fresh incentive for renewed
effort, in his 'official (lemand for
the retirement of the greenbacks
and the issue and control of paper
money (except coin certificates) by
the banks. Senator Quay says
this should be made an issue by
the republicans, and advocates the
substitution of United States notes,
payable in gold, for the green
backs.
Here we have a living issue
with both wings of the gold for
ces, which brings our main question
to the front-Shall the paper
money of the country be issued
and regulated by the people or by
the banks'? This will precipitate
a hot debate in Congress that will
focus public attention upon the
relative merits of scientific and re
dlomption money, which will be
come the absorbing question of the
day, just as the silver movement
followed the silver debate a year
ago, and will afford our sentinels
in congress an opportunity to
measure the true attitude of the
silver, democratic and republican
leaders, on an issue vital to our
party and the welfare of the coun
try, and to determine to what ex
tent our recent allies can be de
pended upon.
Again, the fact that the rail
road, telegraph, and telephone
companies became the willing tools
of a canmpaign committee in the
recent election furnishes us with
another striking argument for the
government ownership of these
great monopolies. We are not a
free people so long as they can be
utilized for campaign purposes in
the interest of trusts and combines.
The proposed retirement of the
greenbacks and the discussion of
the Pacific Railroad question will
bring before Congress the two
strongest measures of our plat
form; and whatever issue the oth
er parties may adopt, the logic of
events will so force upon both
Congress and the people the con
sideration of these measures as to
overshadow all others, and win to
our rafiks thousands of voters
from both the republican and dem
ocratic parties;
LIVING ISSUES FOR THE PEOPLE.
These are living issues upon
which we shall grow. The urgent
necessity for them will appeal to
the people, groaning under the
weight of "McKinley prosperity,"
"restored confidence," and the en
forced idleness and extreme pover
ty attending them. They appeal
with' equal force to the business
man, coerced by the banks; to the
wage earner, the helpless victim of
corporations; and to the '`farmer,
cursed with mortgages ,and extor
tionate freirht rates. They are
issues free from the charge of
mbrcenary motives, to enrich a
portion of our constituency.
Let us act with patriotism, cour
age, and sagacity. Let us lose no
time. If any lack incentive, it
will be found in the intense suffer
ing and in the increasing arrogance,
lawlessness, and heartlessness of
the trusts and monopolies. Against
their power we put principle;
against their money we match man
hood, and urge all populists to
continue this contest during the
next four years and then hold an
early national convention, to strike
the keynote of the next Presiden
tial campaign, or, if desirable, es
tablish an honorable alliiance on
leading issues.
I also suggest that a nsationl con
ference of party leaders and work
ets be held as soon as practicable,
that we may have a full and free
expression of opinioi regarding
our futurework, We hope, there
for, that the-reform pres will give
the fullest possible expression of
their views on this important sub
ject; and ouri friends are.invited
to write me or our national chair
inpn, expressing their ideas on thet
independent party action herein
. il we march to victory un
der our 'own banner, or continue
as itrat~glFrs under another. I
