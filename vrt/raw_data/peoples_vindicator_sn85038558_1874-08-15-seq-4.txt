Hair Vigor
For restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once agreea
ble,. healthy,
and effectual
for preserv
ing the hair.
It soon re
stores fladed
or gray hair
to its orig'inal
color, woith the gloss and freshness of
youthl. Thin hair is thickened, fail
ing hair checked, and baldness often,
though not always, cured by its
use. Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the Iair with a pasty sediment, it
wi 'seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or falling off,
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff, which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which make sonie prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted merely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing else
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil' nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.

tive. Being pure.
' ly vegetable, they
contain no mer
cutry oQ mineral
whatever. Much
serious sickness and suffering is prevented by
their timely use; and every ahmily should
have them on hand for their protection and
relief, when required. Song experience has
proved them to be the safest, sutest, and
best of all the ?ills with which the market
abounds. By their occasionaln use, the blood
is purified, the corruptions of the system ex
pelled, obstructions removed, and the whole
machinery of life restored to its healthy actiw
ity. Internal organs which become clogged
and sluggish are cleansed by Aver'a Pills,
and stimulated into action. Thus incipient
:'disease is change-d into health the value of
which change, wihen reckoned on the vast
multitudes who enjoy it, can hardly be com
puted. Their sugar.eoating makes them
pleasant to take, and preserves their virtues
unimpaired for any length or time, ae that
they are ever fresh, anI perfectly reliable.
Although searching, they are mild, and oper
ate without disturbance to the constitution or
diet or occupation.

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer acnd Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera.. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DR. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
BrrrsEs, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy ftheunc
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VINEYaX BITTERs. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fore-armed.
