Our Home Situation.
The course of the Vindicator dia
ring the time of the efforts to bring
about an adjustment of the diflficul
ties under wvhich our State had suf
fcred so long, was what we consider
ed to be for the true interest of out
people. We think it to be our duty
to now inform our friends that we
fail to see any point for them, in this
compromise business, and Kellogg
has gone from bad to worse in his
appointments for lparochial and city
officers for Natchitoches. The m ishes
of the tax-payer has not been con
suIted, in fact, his treatment of the
white citizens of this parish has been
insulting in the extreme. Our peti.
tions, remonstrances and just rights,
r have beenu received with coldness,
or have been unheeded.
The removal or attempted removal,
of the lawfully elected and commission
ed Police Jury, is the straw that broke
the Camel's back, and now Mr. Kel
logg is at direct issue with our peo
pie-an issue we we have tried to avert;
have warned him and his fricunds what
would occur, and now lie and they
can make the most of it. The P'ayne
Police Jury shall serve, and the D)e
Vargas city government 'will be in
sarrea, nor will any attention be paid
to any other by the people.
All along for almost a year past,
we have told Gov. Kellogg and these
people, that we intended to protect
ourselves from the spoilation of the
Radical plunderers, and that deter
muination is fixed. In the interest of
peace and to carry on our part of the
adjustment, we have not acted in op
position to the appointments made
for this paish, but when it isattempt
ed to foist upon us an iguoraltt P'e
lice Jury, and a direct endeavor is
made to take front us the control of
our municipal atlhirs, it bears upon
its thee the ihtention to plunder, and
we intend to precent evils this time,
not to care them as we did before.
All these acts, totally unbecoming
any party or any individual who de
site good government and a quiet
r situation of affairs, tend only to ex
;apetrte the white people, and ft is
our solemn conviction that the day
of the rule of the besotted and the
ignorant has ended. The white citi
zen 'who is the representative of the
wealth and intelligence of the coun
try must be conmsulted, and unless we
mistake tile temper of our people,
they otow intend to force Gov. Kellogg
top lia heed to those remonstrances
they have so long and so vainly strove
to bring to his mind.
Blunt and Pierson may run Natchi
tcehes parish, but we doubt it very
much, and they will have an oppor
tunity very shortly,,to determine the
extent to which the cwhite people of
Natchitoches will yieid.
A people exasperated. by the injus
tice of' such men, insulted, lied about,
plundried, are'not in a fit mood to
be trified with, and we say, and do
so calmly and after munch reflection,
tkhiat attetion, serious attention, had
befter be phid to our' demands; wre
ieLotting tSjusatice, and as s,free,
enlightened and intelligent people,
tee intend to assert tlhose demands.

City Election.
TOTAL ROUTE OF THE RADICALS.
Peolde's 'Ticket Elected entrre--Gains
in this city.
On Monday last the regular elec
tion for one Mayor and six Couneil
m1en took place in this city, and the
result is highly gratifying to the citi
zens of o0ur lparish.
It must be understood that the
*Radicals have umade persistant efforts
for the past live years to get cdntrol
of our city -overnmeht, but they have
failed each time. Up to 1870 it was
under their administration, and our
finances were in a deplorable condi
tion, and tile compromise of 1873
placed them in charge of the collec
torship, that worthy, true to his in
stincts and the tenets of his party,
proceeded to gobble iup $4,300 of a
$5000 levy. At the election in 1874,
we succeeded in electing Mayor De.
Vargas by a majority of only six, bet
after Cavalry raids, Sherilda's or
ders, sworn lies, on the part of Radi
cal leaders before Congressional Com
mittees, the colored men it seems
don't like that set as much as they
formerly did, as this year the majori
ty is ninety, a claar gain o( 84. s
The election was remarkably quiet,
every store in the city being closed
up and a general turn-out, and the
vote pretty fill.
The following is the return of votes
cast.

The white citizens of Natchitoches
desire to be peaceable and law-abid
ing, but there alm certain bounds be
yo.nd which the most reasonable of
us will not be driven.
Pig-headed Senator Blunt, lie of
inunmmortal, lying and preaching fame,
was wont, in times gone by when his
word hero was law, and at the sound
of his voice the gentle aspirant for
official boners trembled in his boots,
to cavort thlmugh this city like a
Knight of ohl with a hundred or
more ragged negroes at his heels
mounted on plug ponies and armed
with guns and pistols, who, with
whoops and yells, rendered it dan
gerous to walk about much. We un
derstand that this dusky hero is to
celebrate his return from his labors
by one of these armed escorts, at.
tended with this usual rip-snorting
style of conduct, and with a grand
flourish rush upon the political stage
of Natchitoches and strike terror to
the hearts of his foes.
Our comments on this stuff is short,
sweet and to the point, when that
thing is repeated in this place some
one will be hurt, and we are pretty
well sat1fstfd-that it will be Senator
Blunt andhis'ragged dragoons.
If correctly stated, Alaska and the
Sandwich Islands, are both sadly in
need of officials, there not being a
desire on the' part of the inhabitants
of those delectable oasises to "run for
anything," save perhaps a fat Mission
ary in the one instance, and a ton of
rancid blubber in the other. But we
can nasure the inhabitants of those
regions, that Louisiana can furnish
them all they want at cheap rates,
and of all styles and qualities.
The market at this moment is short
of adjusted legislators, but we have
on hand a largo assortnment of "for
the-benefit.of- the-people.--take-any
thing" candidates, that we are anx
ions to dispose of before the cam
p:tigii of 1876. We have no doubt
that a large discount will be allowed
wheu "wholesale' orders are sent in.
Kellogg is trying his hand at the
game of the honest indignant, and
seems to have got hi back slightly
elvrated agaiuist his old friend Clin
ton. At the present indications the
chances: for Clint look gloomy, ani
unless some evidence "turns up" he
is a gone goose. However, to the
fight-the people enjoy the affair
hugely, because we firmly believe it
to be a battle between rogues, whose
falling out will save the people some
thing. Kellogg and his crew cannot
take us in with any such thin chaff
as this "big honest" cry of his-the
effort is too weak, and comes at an
exceeding late hour to satisfy us of
the real parity of his intentions.
We hope that some step will be.ta
ken by our land owners to get a start
of inmmigurtion to our parish. We
are firmly satified that with very hit
tle' exertion, good, substantial men
from the North and West could be
induced to settle among us. The
great question of the salvationr of our
Statjis to be thoroughly settled,a only
wben the tide of white immigration
sets in .this direction. Railroads are
to be, and up doubt will be built, and

L. Caspari, of the lih.t of Cas
pari & Dietrich, merchants, on
Front street, returned from New
Orleans on last trip of the ,art
Able, where he had been for :\,v
eral Weeks purchasing his nman
moth Summer stock of general
merchandise. It is truly a treat
to visit their store and examine
their beautiful stock of all kinds
and lines. Give themi a call as
we Cal assure the public that
great cash bargains can be had.
The ladies will find everything in
the line of fancy dress goods and
trihuninigs of the latest styles and
cheaper than the cheapest.
T'he store of Mr. Beverly Tuck.
er on the corner of Front and Se
cond streets, was entered by bur
glars on last Friday night, and his
cash drawer robbed of sixty dol
lars in money. No goods were ta
ken and the robbers evidently
knew where the money was kept.
An entrance to the house was ef
'ected through a brick wall under
the stairs leading to the Billiard
saloon above, and although Mr.
Tucker was sleeping in a rear room
next his store, so silent were the
burglars that he was not disturb
ed.
This robbery of stores has be.
come so common as to have ceas
ed to excite wonder, no steps have
been taken to ascertain the par
ties who committed them, not
withstanding nearly every store
it town has suffered.
Joseph Ezernack organized his
Police Jury on Manday last, but
of any late operations we are not
apprised. This delightful(?), in
telligent body of bummers are fix
uing up a mess that may in the
end, be quite sickening to them.
The PEOPLE here have had quite
enough of these Police Jury traps,
and the eight per cent taxes heap
ed upoin them is sufficient to de
monstrate the fict of their further
uselessness. We consider the
Payne Police Jury lawful and
commissioned according to law,
and as such we intend to support
them.
The following named are the
appointees of Kellogg: Charles
Boullt, Carroll Jones, Jos. Ezer
hnack, A. Clements, and one other
whose name we have not learned.

shapl' of great grief; have leecn flind hy
the waty side, for the shadow of death
has11 fallen on thell sunshine of her hap
pi.uess more than once to the knowledge
of the writer.
Her first great grief was from the 11slo

II. Twitchell, are monstrous, and
that cuss has declared hds intention
to run that parish to the bitter end
-and we are of the opinion that, if
we know those people, and we
think we do, the end will be reach
ed in a very short time. Twitchell,
like some other good(?) men has about:
played out, and we opine that when
he attempts his "getting even" pro
cess, as -he calls it, with Red River
p;tish, lie will not have so terrible
muchl to brag about.
We call especial attention to the
card of the Detroit Free Press, to be
found elsewhere. This is a sound
Democratic journal and one of the
Best family papers we know of.
This is the funny paper of the
Union, and.those who once read the
Central Police Court sketches will
not soon forget them: Subscribe for
it. See terms.
At the solicitation of a number of
our subscribers, we publish this week
lilunt's testimony before the Con
gressional Committee. We do this
more as a matter of future record for
our people to file away.
Wake up judge, wake up; there's
a burglar in the house, said 3Mrs. Port
ly, in ltrooklyn, to her husband the
other night. The judge rolled out of
bed, grasped hiis revolver, and open
ed the door to sally for the robber.
Thenou, turning to his wife he said :
"Come, Sarah, and lead the way, it's
a damwied mean man that will hurt a
woman."
