“My son Frank Snyder has used
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Fain Pills for a long
time. He never had anything to
help him so much for headache. A
year ago he came home, and I was
down sick with such a dreadful nerv
ous headache. He gave me one of
the Anti-Pain Pills, and after while
I took another and was entirely re
lieved. I always keep them in the
house now, and gave many away to
others suffering with headache.”

DANIEL WEBSTER’S DUEL.
By Rev. Thomas B. Gregory.
Os Randolph’s duel with Clay all
the world has heard, but it is not
generally known that the fiery Vir
ginian once sent a challenge to Daniel
Webster, and that the “Expounder of
the Constitution” chose the path of
peace —and safety.
Early in the year of grace 1824 a
committee of congress was appointed
to investigate certain charges of of
ficial misconduct brought by an ex
senator from Illinois, one Edwards,
against the Secretary of the Treas
ury, the Hon. William H. Crawford.
On this committee there were,
among others, Randolph and Webster.
Before the committee had fairly got
down to business, Randolph sailed for
England, and during his absence a
majority of the committee brought in
a report exonerating Crawford.
In one of the preliminary discus
sions of the committee Webster was
alleged to have said some things about
Randolph that were anything but com
plimentary to his manly character,
and when the 'highstrung Virginian
got back to Washington in the spring
of 1825 it was plain that there would
soon be “something doing.”
If there was ever a human thor
oughbred it was John Randolph of
Roanoke. Os his “honor” he had the
highest possible esteem, and for that
honor he was always prepared to fight
at the drop of the hat.
A few days after his return home
he sent Colonel Thomas H. Benton to
Webster with the following letter:
Sat., Feb/ 20, 1825.
“Sir—Hearn, from unquestionable
authority, that during my late absence
from the United States you have in
dulged yourself in liberties with my
name (aspersing my veracity) which
no gentleman can take who does not
hold himself personally responsible for
such insult.
“My friend, Col. Benton (the bear
er of this note) will arrange with you
the terras of the meeting to which
you are hereby invited.
“I am, sir, your obt. servt.,
“John Randolph of Roanoke.”
Benton, who was somewhat of a
fighter himself, was not slow in taking
the note to the “Expounder,” and in
a few days he was able to report, to
his friend as follows:
“Mr. Webster authorizes Mr. Ben
ton to say to Mr. Randolph that 'he
has no recollection of having said any
thing which can possibly be consider
ed as affecting Mr. Randolph’s ver
acity, beyond what he said in the
House of Representatives. If he has
used other expressions t'hey must have
been at or about the same time and
of the same import. He does not now
recollect them, and disclaims all of a
different import. As to what Mr. Web-
15l)e Jeffersonian
ster said in the House of Representa
tives, he meant only to state that Mr.
Randolph was under an entire mistake
or misapprehension as to the facts —
he meant to say nothing more, and
neither intended to make nor did make
any imputation on the personal verac
ity of Mr. Randolph.”
Os course that settled it and there
was peace.
It is fortunate that Webster’s mem
ory, or lack of memory, came so op
portunely to his rescue, for Randolph
was a crack shot, and had the duel
come off the great New Englander
would probably have fallen long 'be
fore his fame was ripe.—N. Y. Ameri
can.
SONG.
“Dear, though you wander over peace
and passion,
iSearching the days to prove your
self untrue,
5. on cannot hide me Still, in my own
fashion,
I shall come 'back to you.
“In other eyes, on lips that bid you
doubt me,
In music, in the little things we
knew.
In your blind prayers for happiness
without me, —
I shall come back to you.
“Goll keep you safe through all the
ache of learning,
Through all the wrong you need to
be and do,
Till in the wise joy of unfearful
yearning
I shall come back—l shall come
back to you!”
—Brian Hooker, in Harper’s.
