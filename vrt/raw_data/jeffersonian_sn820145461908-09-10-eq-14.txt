JUST POSING.
When platform makers, bosses and
nominees go to posing as ultra-moral
ists, it is a safe bet that the public
is going to get an exhibition that’s
very silly.
Take, for instance, the fuss made
by both the older parties over the
matter of publicity of campaign con
tributions.
There’s Mr. Taft’s letter of ac
ceptance, considerable of it devoted
to the subject of publicity of cam
paign contributions.
Then there’s Mr. Bryan solemnly
announcing to his national committee
that, after conference, he and Mr..
Kern are unanimous as to the wis
dom of making such contributions
public and with such proceeding u a
new era in American politics will be
gin, to the great moral improve
ment of such politics.
Os course, the matter isn’t an issue
at all.

SEE PAGE SEVEN FOR “HOW TO GET UP A CLUB.”
If the Republican party, or the
Democratic party, favors such pub
licity, all it has to do is to publish
the contributions.
No special session of congress is
necessary to pass laws for it, and
there’s no existing laws to prevent it.
It is wholly a matter of free will
on the part of either party.
If it is right, Mr. Taft’s committee
or Mr. Bryan’s committee can go
ahead and do it, regardless of what
any other committee does.
But this wouldn’t suffice.
There wouldn’t be enough politics
in such honest, fearless action.
There must be some high moral
posing, wind-jamming and bambooz
ing of unthinking partisans.
Without these things, half the
game of politics wouldn’t be played,
and the game is only well played
when as much dust as possible is put
in the people’s eyes. —Rural Weekly,
