DON'T BE DECEIVED.
NO HOPE FOR FREE SILVER IN
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
tweaty-One Out of Twenty-Three states
Declared for Free Silver in ld90 in I
Democratic State Conventions, hut
iln Voted Agalast It in 1892.
(Missouri World.)
Let no one build up hope from the
recent activity of the silver Democrat.,
that that party can or will give the
country a free coinage law. We want
our silver friends in the Democratic
party to look at the situation as it is.
You have been grievously disappointed
once. Almost a lifetime of labor has
been brought to naught by over-con
fidence in your party. Stand off for a
moment as a non-partisan and take a
look at your party. In 1880 the Demo
cratic party in the same states in
which the silver Democrats are now so
active declared for the free coinage of
silver in language that admitted of no
double construction (except in Illi
nois, where the plank was not very
definite). Yet the goldbug Democrats
were sufecleluly numerous in Congress
at the extra session two years ago to
not only prevent the passage of a free
silver bill, but to wipe out the last law
favorable to silver and readopt the de
monetizing act of 1873. Here are the
silver planks in the Democratic plat
forms of 1890. We get these planks
from the New York World Almanac,
189L It reports only twenty-three
state Democratic conventions adopting
money planks in 1890, and of these
twenty-one were for the free coinage
if silver.
Arkansas.-We denounce as iniqui
tous the silver bill as passed by the
present Republican House of Repre
sentatives, as an attempt to demoral
lie silver and to build up the fortunes
)f the favored few, and we favor the
free and unrestricted coinage of silver,
Ind an increased volume of currency,
restricted alone to the necessary de
mands of the country, which shall be
a legal tender for all debts, public and
private. We believe the power to is
sue and control the volume of currency
belongs alone to the government and
that this power should not be delegated
to or controlled by any other author
ity.
California.-We favor the free coin
age of silver, and demand that it be
made an unlimited legal tender for all
purposes, public and private.
Colorado.-We condemn the present
administration for reckless and un
necessary waste of public treasure, by
means of which the surplus fund accu
mulated under the wise and economic
administration of Grover Cleveland has
practically disapppeared, in place of
which the country is threatened with a
deficiency arising from the increase of
expenditures over receipts for the pres
ent fiscal year. We demand the free
and unlim%)ed coinage of silver.
Idaho.-We tender our gratitude to
the Democrats in Congress for their
almost unanimous votes in both houses
for the free and unlimited coinage of
silver, and congratulate the people of
our new state that there is one great
political organization in the country
committed by Its votes in Congress to
a measure so essential to the prosper
ity of Iimbo. The silver bill as en
acted by the Republican Congress is a
compromieo in the Interests of Wall
street, clothes the secretary o1 the
treasury with poer to refuse to pur
ehase bUllis on the' pretext that bul
lies not etered at the market price,
sad enables him to beer the silver mar
ket by refusing to purchase except at
his discreteon and at such prices as he
may determine.

omnsm of silver.

Missouri.--We are in favor of the
free and unrestricte"l coinage of silver
and the increase of currency to meet
the legitimate demands of trade, and
we believe that the power to issue and
control the volume of such currency
should be assumed by the government.
Nebraska. -We favor the placing of
the silver dollar on its former footing
with gold coin in our coinage law, with
equal legal tender qualities, and we
denounce as unjust and dishonest the
law recentv ln:,ctPed as a discrimina
tion in favor of the gold coin for the
benefit of the mnoocy power, and we fur
ther declare ourselves in favor of the
free coinage of silver.
Novada.-\\We declare for t:, f,,
and unlimited coinage of standard sil
ver dollars of the present veight and

debts, public and private, e :ally with
gold.
North Carolina.-The Demtocracy of
North Carolina favor the free coinage
of silver and an increase of the cur
rency and the repeal of the internal
revenue system. * * * We de
mand the abolition of national banks
and the substitution of legal tender
treasury notes in lieu of national bank
notes, issued in sufficient volume to
do the business of the country on a
cash system, regulating the amount
needed mn a per capita basis, as the
business interests of the country ex
pands, and that all money issued by
the government shall be legal tender
in payment of all debts, both public
and private.
Ohio.-We favor the free coinage o'
silver with its present ratio with gold.
Oregon.-We reaffirm the position
which has ever been maintained by the
Democratic party, that gold and silver
are equally the people's money; we are
opposed to all measures of discrimina
tion against silver, and demand free
coinage to supply the needs of busi
ness; and that all money issued by
the government be made legal tender
for all debts, both public and private.
South Carolina (Tillman faction)
We demand the abolition of national
banks, and that legal tender treasury
notes be issued in sufficient volume to
do the business of the country on a
cash system, and that all money issued
by the government shall be legal ten
der in payment of all debts, both pub
lic and private. * * * (We fa
vor) the free and unlimited coinage of
silver, the increase of the currency and
the repeal of the internal revenue Sys
tem.
South Dakota.-That we are in favor
of the full remonetization of silver, the
free and unlimited coinage thereof and
the issuance of coin certificates based
thereon which shall be a full legal ten
der.
Tennessee.-We demand a curreney
of gold and silver, and also of paper,
convertible into coin at the option of
the holder, and we demand the free
coinage of silver on the basis originally
fixed by law, and that it and the gold
dollar shall be equally a unit of value.
Texas.-We are opposed to the con
tinuance of the national banking sys
tem and demand the abolishment
thereof as soon as by law the same can
be done. * * * We are in favor of
the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver and endorse the action of our sen
ators and representatives therefor.
West Virginia.-That the Democrats
of West Virginia declare that they
are unalterably in favor of the free and
unlimited coinage of silver.
Wyoming.-We demand the free
coinage of silver, and we denounce the
Republican party for the enactment of
a law which makes it discretionary
with the secretary of the treasury to
demonetize silver.
If such straight out declarations in
twenty-one state platforms only two
years before the last presidential elec
tlon resulted in the demonetisation of
silver by the party adopting them, what
ground is there for hope from the
Democratic party by reason of the
present activity of the silver Demo
crats? Even if the silver Democrats
controlled the next Democratic national
convention and secured the nomination
of a silver man for President and elect
ed him, there would be enough gol&i
bug Democrats carried into Congesh
by the Deocratie victory to enable
the Republi'cas to deteat a free silver
bill. The silver Democrats should
come to the People's party. The silver
men must unite to obtain victory over
the gold power sad they cannot unite
in the Democratic party; that is cer
tain, because Republiea silver men
will not go to the Democrats, and Pop
mlusts will not go to a party in which
they will have to sit o committees
with gold bugs, and whleh in one part
of the nation is electing men to na

CAN'T BE ANSWERED.
THIRTY REASONS FOR FREE
COINAGE OF SILVER.
Hon. N. H. Harvey, Author of "Coln's
Financial School" Proves Conclusively
That the Free Coinage of Silver at a
Ratio of 16 to 1 is Pro BonoPlublico.
The following are the thirty rea
sons for the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1, given by W. II.
Harvey, author of C'oin's financial
school:
1. Silver and gold at about the
ratio of Ili to 1 have been used jointly
for hundreds of 3years with satlsfac
tory results.
2. Seventy-live per cent of the peo
ple of the world now use silver money
exclusively.
3. The cost of mining silver has
been understated by the gold stand
ard men. The best authorities say
it has cost more to produce a pound
of silver than a pound of gold.
4. Gold can be hoarded by a few
capitalists and the world suffers.
With two metals as primary money
(gold and silver) this could not be
done.
5i. The supply of gold is inadequate
to the needs of commerce.
6. Gold does not increase as fast in
proportion as does comm.erce.
7. While in 200 years there was un
der free coinage a variation of only
about one point, in twenty-one years
under demonetization there has been
a variation of 16 points.
n. The decline in the market value
of silver has been mainly caused by
its demonetization in 1873 and in the
years following, and the fall in prices
of most commodities in the United
States is due to the demonetization of
silver in 1873.
9. When silver was demonetized, in
February, 1873, silver as measured
in gold was at a premium. The ar
gument of depreciated silver could
not then have been made.
10. England, by her possession in
Africa and her stealing of territory in
Venezuela, controls most of the gold
supply of the world and gets the bal
ance by reason of the world owing it
to her on gold notes and gold bonds.
11. Except some silver production
in Australia, England produces prac
tically no silver.
12. The United States produces
from or.e-third to one-half of the sil
ver of the world. She certainly has
the power to control the silver market
and yet she has not only not resisted
England's repeated attacks on silver
both open and covert, but has assisted
that nation in the discrediting of sil
ver and the lowering of its value.
13. All single standard gold men
whose opinions have been published
agree in the statement that if the na
tions of the world,or if England alone
would consent to an international
agreement the ratio of 16 to 1 would
be easily sustained.
14. It is vain to hope fqr help from
England in the efforts to restore silver
to its former position. As the great
creditor nation she thinks it is to her
interest to make money scarce and
dear. (See Gladstone's speech of
March 1, 1893.)
15. Only 4 per cent of the business
of the people of this nation is carried
on with foreign countries. It is bet
ter to legislate for the 96 per cent of
domestic commerce than for the 4
cent of foreign commerce.
16. The constitution of the United
States gave power to congress to coin
money and regulate the value thereof.
Said Daniel Webster: "*I am certain
ly of the opinion that gold and bilver
at a ratio fixed by congress constitute
the legal standard of value in this
country, and that neither congress
nor any state has authority to estab
lish any other standard or to displace
the standard."
17. The reduction of the quantity
of primary money rednoes the price
of labor, property and commodities.
18 Property measures its value in
money and money measures its value
in property. Money may increase in
value by prason of its security. When
this is the case it buys more proper
ty, property buys less money.
19. It is absolutely certain that leg
islation reduces the volume of money
one-half by depriving silver of its
monetarwy funcation depresses prices
sad enhances the power of the re
maliing half. As the strain upon the
remalng half inoreases this process
is liable to go on untilvalaues are so
reduced as to paurperiae mankind.
20. The United States huas reduced
its debts from *2,700,000,000 in 1869
to *100,000,000, yet it will take un
der a gold standard as much of our
property to pay tbo $1,000,000,000 me
would have paid the whole ddo oi
1609.
21. There are but 8,00,000,U00 of
gold la the world. If this seeld all
i nclosed l a solid cube is would
be less tha tweaty-two feet In dinm
nter.
t The mal ase of slv" was to
eotrelate us moee. Wag astils
stepped coining it the demand fell qi,
sad the price aleo. If this natiom,
with usee others ue wouald be easully
lnadaued telo it, should remometixe
uilirr the deands would oon ad
vem the pries to where it was be
koes dematsta es.
23. Free coinage of slilver at a nxed
quantity to constitute a dollar pro
tects silver against market fluctua
tions and the manipulations of bulls
and bears, placing it on the same
basis as gold in this respect.
24. There has never been at any
moment in the world's history a
superabundance or plethora of the
two metals, or either of them, not
even during 1861-65. during which
quarter of our century the supply
from the mines amounted to as much
in weight as has been produced for
33.) years antecedently
25. The demand for money is equal
to the sum of the demand for all otner t
things. The competition for money
is therefore not ol:ly inces-ant, but
instant, urgent importunate and uni
versal. It is, therefore, a mistake to
say that the demand for money is
limited by the demand upon banters
for loans. There may be, however,
plethora of loaning money at money
centers when industries are arrested.
26. Wherever there have been op
pressed people who have looked to
this nation for hope and help in the
past they are now looking to free
America for relief, in the midst of
the struggle against gold monotmet
allism. We have it in our power to
relieve them and enhance our own
greatness and the peace and pros
perity of the world. Shall we do it?
27. When any important country,
powerful enough to have the proper
influences, establishes a bimetallic
currency at a fixed ratio and main
tains the parity, of necessity the
whole world is on the same bimetallic
basis.
28. The United States is great
enough and has sufficient resources to
undo the wrong of 1873, and, as in
1776 we proclaimed the political
emancipation of mankind, so now we
will proclaim financial emancipation
from the Shylocks of the old world.
29. We believe as Carlisle, the
present secretary of the treasuary,
believed when, on February 21, 1878,
he said in the congress of the United
States: ".I know that the world's
stock of precious metals is none too
large, and I see no reason to appre
hend that it will ever be so. Man
kind will be fortunate indeed if the
annual production of gold and silver
coin shall keep pace with the annual
increase of population and industry.
According to my views of the subject,
the conspiracy which seems to have
been formed here and in Europe to
destroy by legislation and otherwise
from three-sevenths to one-half the
metallic money of the world is the
most gigantic crime of this or any
other age. The consumation of such
a scheme would ultimately entail
more misery upon the human race
than all the wars, pestilences and
famines that ever occurred in the his
tory of the world."
. 30. Silver has been called the
money of the people, gold the money
of the rich. The demand for the
single gold standard means riches for
the few, poverty for the many. As
James G. Blaice said, when speaking
in the United States senate in 1873:
"It would not be difficult to show
that in the nations where both gold
and silver money have been fully
recognized and most widely diffused,
the steadiest and most coutinuous
prosperity has been enjoyed-that
true form of prosperity which reaches
all classes, but which begins with the
dlay laborer whose toil lays the foun
dation of the whole superstructure of
wealth. The exclusively gold nation,
like England, may show the most
massive fortunes in the ruling classes,
but it shows also the most helpless
and hopeless poverty in the humble
walks of life."
Very True.
Within a few days of first using
scales for weighing gold cqin, instead
of counting it as heretofore, the Seat
tle custom house has rejec)ed more
than $2000 of under-welght coin.
Light-weight gold coins are no
more legal tender than is goose grease
with its hair on. The, wear of gold
carried In the pocket for a year or so
spoils it for money purposes, though
what is left may be melted again, and
and when the coins are full
weight they are legal tender.
Without the stamp of the government,
with all its blowing aod pomposity,
gold is of no more account as money
than is a piece of copper that is un
stamped. Stripped of its ast it is
simple bgold. Were one ounce of gold
stamped by the govesement in certifi
cation that it is legal tender for ten
thousand dollars, it would be just
what the stamp said it was, and the
same rule applies to any other thing
carrying the fat or stamp of the gov
ernment to this effect.-Pomeroy's
Advance Thought.

4 PER CENT LOANS.
THE SOUTH NOW FLOODED
WITH CHEAP MONEY.
a Ruse of the Goldhugs-They Lead
Money to Our Bankers, Who in Turn
Lend It Out at Big Interest-The
Plan.
People's Party Paper: The news
!omes from New York that $7,000,000
Dr $8,000,000 have been loaned to the
banks in South Carolina, Georgia and
Alabama since May 1st at the low rate
:f 4 per cent. This money is shipped
gown here to make the dear people be
leve that prosperity has resumed busi
ness at the old stand and that a con
tracted currency is a delusion and a
snare. The banks that are borrowing
the money propose to turn it loose in
the south. By a preconcerted arrange
ment, however, it will drift into the
hands of country merchants at 8 per
tent, who will in turn let the farmers
have it in the way of plantation sup
plies at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent
Interest. Of course, the promoters of
President Cleveland's financial scheme
are behind this movement. It is a ruse
an the part of the bankers to establish
the idea that money is plentiful and a
:hange from the present financial sys
tem unnecessary. It will be observed,
however, that the bankers and mer
chants are the only ones that secure a
;lean-cut profit, while the farmers, who
are the real endorsers for the loan, have
all of the burdens to bear and as usual
reap none of the benefits. The New
York correspondent who called atten
tion to this influx of cheap money goes
into details which are very interesting.
He says:
"There have been a large number
of bankers visiting New York from
the states of South Carolina, Georgia
and Alabama since May 1st, at differ
ent times. Probably other southern
states had as many, but most of the
men I am acquainted with are from
the states named, and they are here
for the purpose of arranging, whether
preconcerted or not, to get currency
to carry to their respective state. I
am informed by one of the intelligent
men above named that they have se
cured loans from bankers in this city
since the 1st of May amounting to
$7,000,000 or $8,000,000. They get it
for 4 per cent until the Ist of October,
with the privilege of renewing at that
time on 30, 60 and 90 days at the same
rate of interest. In conversation with
one of these bankers to-day, he in
formed me that it would make times
better in the south when this money
was turned loose.
"'How do you propose to turn it
loose? ' I inquired. "
"'Oh,' he said, 'we can turn four
times that amount loose in our states
at a good rate of interest. We will
lend this money, due say October 1st,
at 8 to 12% per cent per annum, which
you see will be quite a nice profit for
as on the amount loaned.'
"'But can you,' I asked, 'make these
loans on good security?'
"'Just as good as anybody would
wish. In the first place a great deal
Qf this money will be loaned to mer
chants who sell what is known in our
section of the country as time goods
to farmers. These merchants will
pay us, say 8 per cent. Then they will
sell goods due in October to planters
and farmers and get 15 or 20 per cent
for the supplies.'
"'Then you think this process will
make good times?'
"'Well,' he. said, 'it will give the
people what they want-that is,
money.'
"'But can they make any money
by paying this high rate of inter
est?'
"'Of course the merchants will.
They pay 8 per cent for it and if they
eUll to the farmers goods on time,
the lurmers will have to pay a very
high rate of interest, it is true, but
they can not make a crop without
something to make it with, and while
the Interest these farmers have to pay
is pretty high, It is not as much as
they have paid In the past and we will
have ae trouble in disposing of this
money, as I tell you.'
"This is the programme that is be
ing worked to relieve the presesure in
the south. It may bring about tem
porary prosperity, but in the end,
when the day of settlement comes, I
think the farmers will be left pretty
much in the condition they were in
before they borrowed the money;
many aed them probably in a worse
