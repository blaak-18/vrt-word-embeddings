BITING THE NAILS.
A Senseless Habit for Whleh No Execse
Can Be Found.
The practice of nibbling at the fin
ger nails is to be condemned, first on
the ground that the nails are thereby
Srendered- brittle and unsightly; and,
Ssebondly, because it is a senseless habit
which makes the practice of it a source
of constant irritation to the friends of
any one who has the habit.
The habit is usually acquired at
school in early childhood, and steps
should at once be taken to break it up.
This may be done in various mays.
It is usually sufficient to explain to the
child the perniciousness of the habit,
requesting him to be constantly watch
ful against it in himself, and to dis
courage the practice in every one
else. Punishment is usually uncalled
for.
Strategy may be resorted to in case
the habit is well established. The fin
ger ends may be dipped in some harm
less preparation of a disagreeable or
bitter nature, which will serve to re
mind the child what he is doing.
A French investigator has lately
published the results of an elaborate
study of the subject, chiefly in refer
ence to the importance of the habit as
an indication of nervous disease.
His investigations have been pursued
among the school children of Paris,
among whom he found the habit wide- i
ly prevalent. Of the total number of
children examined, about one-third
were given to the practice, the greater
proportion being among the girls. The i
age at which the habit was most com
mon was found to be between twelve E
and fifteen years. c
The investigator thinks he has dis
-covered a remarable relation between
nail-biting and a defective, or at least t
an impaired stability of, mind and i
character, as all the teachers united in c
saying that the pupils addicted to nail- I
biting were the poorest students. The 2
boys were inclined to effeminacy, and r
the girls to slackness. Both sexes I
showed a lessened ability to sustain t
the attention, and were consequently c
the hardest pupils to teach. r
According to this French student the u
habit is best corrected by endeavoring p
to transform the unconscious act into l
a conscious one, thereby counteracting f
the tendency to a confirmed habit. r
It is doubtful if nail-biting is indie- t
ative of anything more serious than a n
nervous temperament, which should be p
treated on general principles.-Youth's b
Companion. a
WONDERFUL PICTURE.
Instantaneous Photograph of a Horse v u

Capt. J. B. Dumas, now in Tunis. and i
who is one of the most remarkable i
horsemen of our army, sends us what
we consider a most wonderful instan- t

energy all the warnings to keep out of Pl

A CHINESE SCALE.
How to Sake One of These Quaint Con
trlvaneos at Home.
n Construct, out of pastboard or thin
I wood, a scale composed of three up
rights and four horizontal cross-pieces,
t the result being a frame inclosing six 1
compartments. The cross-pieces are
f each pierced with two holes, which we
will number from 1 to 8. Procure six
t chessmen, three white, a b c, and three
black, d e f--circular bits of cork or
cardboard will do equally well--and
pierce a hole through the center of
each. Lastly, take a long cord threaded
through a canvas needle and having a
I large button attached to one end. This
is all the apparatus necessary for the
l game illustrated in the accom
panying cut. The manner of playing c
it is as follows: Arrange the chessmen
f so that a white one is in each compart- b
ment to the right and a black in each
compartment to the left, the cord pass-a
ing through the holes in the cross- a
pieces and chessmen in their re
spective order. This gives you a series h
of 14 holes: 1, f; 2, e; 3, d; 4, 5, a; 6, b;
7, c, and 8.
LNow, suppose you wish to modify n
this arrangement of he pieces; as, for
instance, to make theblacksand whites
change sides. To do this. pass the
needle through 8. e; 7, b; 6. a; 5. 4, d; t
2, e: 2 and f. If you were to draw the
needle at this moment, the cord, fold
ing back on itself, would pass out of
the holes and leave the pieces free. In P
order to avert this.-wind the cord
round the lower end of the upright sit
uated under the hole, H. This done,
pass the cord through the holes: c, 2;
b, 3; a, 4; 5; d, 6; e, 7; f and 8. Now,
free the cord at the bottom of the up
the button. Instantly, and as if by
magic, the blacks and whites change
places. A number of interesting com- g
binations may be produced with this o]
apparatus. Suppose one wants to bring tc
all the pieces into the third upper be
compartment to the left. the blacks
under the whites. For this, after hav
ing passed the cord through the holes
in a reversed sense. as previously, pass ha
it up from below through 2 and 3; T
thread the three blacks, d e f, the
three whites, ab e, and then pass the as
cord through 4, .5, 6, 7, 8. Detach the i4
cord below, draw the button, and the
problem is solved. tr

Method In Her Vanity.
A well-known asthete recently ad
vised women never to pass a mirror
without looking into it, and observant
persons perceive the wisdom of this in
junction. When one is shopping, for
instance, full-length mirrors are fre
quently encountered, and a passing
glance is sufficient to reveal the dis
ordered veil or hat, the strrp of braid
torn from the bottom of the gown, the
bow or flounce awry or any other de
feet in the toilet, and it is then an easy
matter to remedy the shortcoming, j
which, neglected, would stamp one as
lacking in proper regard for tidiness. t
Therefore, the modern woman glances x
into every mirror as she hurries along a
and takes a furtive peep now and then
into the jeweled glass suspended at her a
belt., earing not one whit if some of her
friends deem it a vanity, as long as she 1
is thus reassured of her neat and trim a
appearane.

"We were married thirty-seven
years," a man said who had lost his
wife, "and in all that time she never
gave me a cross word. But I shall b
never forget the first time I scolded
her. One morning when we had been
married about two years, I found a
button off my shirt. I threw- the gar
maent at her and said, in a rongh voice:
'Sew a button on.' She got a button
and sewed it on, saying: 'Forgive me,
husband, I had a great deal to do yes
tearday and I forgot it, but it shall
never happen again.' Her gentle words c
almost broke my heart. I could have a
gone down on my knees to ask her for- 3

me, and the world has been a different

The Wee Ome's Thumb.
Nothing too strong can be said le
against permitting children to suck
their thumbs. Charming and heart- a
delighting as this common occupation fc
of the baby is to the average mother,
aothing will more surely ruin the
shape of the hands. It is the cause of
broad, fat thumbs in after life. There a'
are preparations to put upon the baby's s
thumbs which will render these rosy
digits less palatable, and after one or y
two attempts baby will eoon forget the y
lnajrios habit.

The Study of Manners.
An eastern female collee has intro.
duced into its curriculum a systematic
study of manners. It is to be hoped
that other institutions of learning-es.
pecially public schools-will take up s
like course. As a nation we are sadly
deficient in this respect. In attempting
to avoid elaborate and often absurd
ceremonies of European polite life, we
have gone to the opposite extreme and,
as a consequence, sometimes Ameticans
of the most refined nature appear rude
and uncouth. We need to know more
of the conventionalities of elegant so
ciety, without going into the fini'cal
questions of etiquette that are bother
some and unimportant. Teach our
young men and women the politeness
that comes from a gentle heart and a
delicate perception.-Womankind

TAKE STEPS
in time, ifyou are a suf'-.

of humanity known as
consumption, and you
can be cured. There is
the evidence of
hundreds of liv
ing witnesses to
the fact that, in
all its early
stages, consump

disease. Not

large percenltaA of '

covery even after the disease has pro
gressed so far as to induce repeated bleed
ings from the lungs, severe lingering cough
with copious expectoration (including tu
bercular matter), great loss of fesh and ex
treme emaciation and weakness.
Do you doubt that hundreds of such cases
reported to us as cured by " Golden Mled
ical Discovery " were genuine cases of that
dread and fatal disease? You need not take
our word for it. They have, in nearly every
instance, been so pronounced by the best
and most experienced home physicians,
who have no interest whatever in mis
representing them, and who were often
strongly prejudiced and advised against I
a trial of "Golden Medical Discovery,"
but who have been forced to confess at
it surpasses, in curative power over this
fatal malady, all other medicines with
which they are acquainted. Nasty cod
liver oil and its filthy "emulsions" and
mixtures, had been tried in nearly all these
cases and had either utterly failed to bene
fit, or had only seemed to benefit a little for
a short time. Extract of malt, whiskey,
and various preparations of the hypo
phosphites had also been faithfully tried
in vain.
The photographs of a large number of
those cured of consumption, bronchitis,
lingering coughs, asthma, chronic nasal
catarrh and kindred maladies, have been
skillfully reproduced in a book of i6o
pages which will be mailed to you, on
receipt of address and six cents in
stamps. Yon can then write to those who
have been cured and profit by their ex
perience.
