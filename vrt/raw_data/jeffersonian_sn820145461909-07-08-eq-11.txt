WANTS TO BE AN OLD MAID.
I like to draw pictures, and used
to think I would like to be an artist;
but I like music and think I will be
a music-teacher. I want to be an

AN AMBITIOUS LITTLE GIRL.
Is there room for one more in your
large family of boys and girls? I
think it is a good thing for you to
have a page for children, because it

it makes us read more.
Papa takes the Jeffersonian and
the Watson’s Magazine. He thinks
Mr. Watson is the smartest man in
the world.
Now I will tell you what I hope to
be. I would like to graduate at a
college, in music, expression, and lit

want to teach music.

the sixth grade.—Cora Anderson.

good horses, tools and be a reformer.
I live on the farm and enjoy it very
much. I am a little boy 12 years
old. —Your friend, Marshall Binkley.

For fear this will fall in the waste
basket, I will quit.—Eula Roberts,
age 14, Tazewell, Ga.
