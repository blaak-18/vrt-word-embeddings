SAVING THE COUNTRY.
About the middle of the eighteenth
century the William Pitt, who was
afterward Earl of Chatham, en
gaging a peer of the realm in private
converse, exclaimed: “My lord, I
can save this country, and I am the
only man who can.” It was not
egotism; it was fact. The event
proved it; for as soon as his hand
got the reins victory perched on
British arms, on land and on sea, in
every quarter of the globe.
But the Honorable John Temple
Graves tells us that it will take three
men to save this country—Bryan,
Hearst, and Tom Watson. Perhaps
so. This country is more than three
times as big as the British empire
was in 1750, computing not by physi
cal area, but by wealth, population,
and —possibly —by civilization.
Mr. Graves advises that Bryan,
Hearst, and Watson commune, devise
ways, and save to the American peo
ple the pleasant waters that live in
the wells dug by our fathers, or
words of like import. To “com-*
mune” these gentlemen must come
together. Where is Mr. Graves going
to find a house big enough to hold
Mr. Bryan and Mr. Watson at the
same time? When Mr. Watson was
candidate for Vice-President on a
ticket th.it Mr. Bryan headed, the
boundless canopy of heaven was too
circumscribed to rocer them in
seance. Mr. Watson feels that he is
a greater man than Mr. Bryan, and
in this mighty stunt of saving the
country Mr. Watson has no notion
of playing second fiddle to Mr. Bryan
or to anybody else.
But we hope Mr. Graves will get
Bryan and Watson together. A heart
to-heart talk between them would be
worth reporting. And yet we beg
to hope that there shall not be too
much of the country-saving stuff.
As be ween Bryan and Watson, who
is to say whom of them is Quintus
Curtins? —The Washington Post.
BAILEY SPOILED.
There is something quite humiliat
ing and pitable, too, in the quiet de
mand of the Democratic Senators
that Bailey, of Texas, step down and
out from th? leadership of his party
in the upper chamber. Since the
death of the cool, astute Gorman he
has headed the minority. The posi
tion is one of great honor and import
ance. It indicates on the part of as
sociates respect for character and con
fidence in tact, judgment and pro
found ability. Its opportunities for
usefulness are many. The leader of
a minority watches lynx-eyed every
movement of the enemy, takes advan- •
tage of every mistake, and finds the
fitting opening for the decisive thirst.
He counters every blow, exposes all
fallacies, prevents hasty and im
mature action, and holds, for a time
at least, all obnoxious measures up
to the gaze of the country, so that
popular opinion may and
work for their outright defeat of
material alteration. He takes a
prominent part in the consultations
of his colleagues, maps the plan of
campaign, and is influential in the
selection of the combatants of spe
cific schemes of legislation. He is a
dictator, so far as that character is
compatible with the co-operation of
associates of the forceful natures,
distinguished characters and acknowl
edged abilities of those by whom he
is surrounded. His position is an
outgrowth of party organization and
THE TEFFERSONTAK.
an indispensable necessity of party
solidarity and aggressiveness. In the
House of Commons the leader of His
Majesty’s Opposition is only less hon
ored and intluential than the Prime
Minister himself. Indeed, when pos
sible, he is former Prime Minister,
and upon a change of administration,
generally heads the incoming
me nt.
From this exalted station Senator
Bailey has been reduced to the ranks.
Without any intention, we are sure,
of needlessly lacerating his already
raw feelings, the Democratic Sena
tors, in selecting Culberson, of
Texas, to succeed his colleague, could
have hit upon no more effective way
of accentuating in the public mind
the deposition of the discrowned
leader. The controlling reasons for
the charge are not far to seek, and
they carry a painful but wholesome
lesson. Bailey’s intellectual powers
are in the full fruition of a splendid
maturity. His knowledge of men and
affairs is quite perfect. His ac
quaintance with the rules governing
parliamentary bodies is profound, and
his ability to use them both for the
discomfiture of his opponents and the
adoption of the policies of his party
is unrivalled. His physical man
hood—no small consideration in the
esteem of experienced legislators—is
superb. He is in every essential
particular more suited for the leader
ship of the minority of the Senate
than ever before, nor could any limit,
be reasonably suggested to the
heights to which he might have
aspired.
His fall —for fall it is—is the sad
story of the “stuck eagle” prostrate
on the plain, the dart self-fabricated
The greed of gold, the haste to be
rich, the method of amassing repel
lent to enlightened public conscience,
all that and the house beautiful of an
enviable reputation, by long years of
strenuous exertions erected, comes
tumbling about his ears. The punish
ment of Bailey is fiercely retributive,
and a stern warning to all public ser
vants.—Richmond Journal.

THOS. E. WATSON DINES WITH PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.

hold-up, did not include in her consti
tution discriminations against the ne
gro which otherwise would have been
inserted. No time has been lost by
the Legislature in putting a staute in
force which relegates the negro to
“Jim Crow” cars and to separate
waiting rooms in the stations. Proxi
mity to the South and a large south
ern element in the population has
dictated this action. The Caucasian
is discreet in his pride. The red
Indian is deemed inferior also, but he
often is very wealthy. Many of his
sons and daughters are educated.
Indian blood flows in the veins of one
of the state’s first representatives in
Congress. Moreover, the Indian still
has federal guardians.—Boston Her

WATSON AND BRYAN.
The Hon. Thomas Watson of Geor
gia, who called at the White House
yesterday, ii said to have remarked
to President Roosevelt in the course
of their conversation that the Hon.
William Jennings Bryan is “one big
laugh. ’ ’ The dispatches do not re
port what followed, but probably the
two distinguished gentlemen proceed
ed to emphasize this opinion in suit
ing the action to the word.
There does not appear to be any
good reason why Tom Watson should
discredit his former running mate on
the Populist presidential ticket. That
is., no reason so far as any difference
in principles goes. It would take
a hair-splitting distinction to point out
such a difference. Nearly all the ex
treme radicals in the country who are
not for Roosevelt are for Bryan, and
Mr. Watson would seem to fall more
naturally on the Bryan side, but he
has a private grievance.
In 1904 the Populists who had sup
ported Mr. Bryan in the two former
presidential campaigns, dissolved the
compact with the Democrats and
nominated Mr. Watson for President.
Mr. Watson, not without reason,
thought it was “up to Bryan” to
support him in preference to Parker
but Air. Bryan was too good a politi
cian to adopt that plan.
The Bryan-Hearst friendship was
