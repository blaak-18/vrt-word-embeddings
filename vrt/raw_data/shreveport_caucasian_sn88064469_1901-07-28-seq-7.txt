DIFFER WITH KOCH.
Cornell Professor Incline to the Theory
Cattle Spread. Tuberculosis.
Ithaca, N. Y., July 27.--James law.
director of the New York State College
of Cornell University, has given out an
interview witn Prof. Koch in his con
clusion that baccilus which was found
in cattle could not be transfered to the
human kind. The Cornell professor said
in regard to the dissemination of hu
man and bovine tuberculosis, that it is
very clear that baccilus tuberculosis as
grown or cultivated in the human body
and bovines acquires qualities that are
characteristic of different habits, but
that it is too early to take the absolute
position attributed to Dr. Koch's cable.
gram, that baccilus in one germ is rad
ically different from that found in tha
other.
It has been shown that cultivation of
human baccilus in colodion capsules in
the abdomen of a chicken adapts itself
after a time to the conditions of life is
the fowl, said Dr. Law, so that it in
fects the fowl promptly and extensively.
Taking into account the facts that the
growth of tuberculosis baccillus of a
chicken, of a cow and of a human be
ing, in artificial media, follows the
same course in all cases, and that the
product of one baccilus may be used as
effectively as those of another in test
ing for tuberculosis, the presumption is
altogether in favor of primary funda
mental identity. They have simply ac
quired new habits by living in a per
titular genus
WILL NOT INTERVENE.
Ne Foundation for the Rumor That Ger
many Would Intereede.
London, July 27.-There is but little
Ioundation for the ramay that the Ger
man emperor has efered his services as
mediator between the British govern
ment and the Boer leaders, with the
object of bringing the war in South
Africa to an end. The kaiser has all
along adopted a neutral attitude and it
is most improbable that he would now
contemplate the possibility of making
a representa on to this country to pre
vent the war from being fought to a
finish. Such action would be regarded
as an unwarrantable interference, and
the kaiser is not so foolish as to anorifloe
all the fruits of his uowent friendly poli.
cy with this country.
Conviet Camp Investigatis.n
Little Rock, July 27.-Governor Jeff
Davis and Prosecuting Attorney F. B.
Brown of Des Arch, have returned from
England, where they went to investi
gate the reported whipping to death of a
convict sent from Hot Springs county,
named Riley. The governor is satisfied
that the man died from inhuman treat
ment and will have the matter laid be
fore the Lonoke grand jury. During the
month of June seven men died at the
England camp, several of whom, it is
alleged, under very suspicious circum
stances.
Fatal Gas Exploslon.
Muatie, Ind., July 27 -Wm. Wright
had his eyes burned out and his wife
was burned to death in a natural gas
explosion at Matthews. They reside at
Fowlerton and were getting a drink of
water in the pumphouse at the railroad
water tank. The pump is worked with
natural gas, which filled the room. The
man struck a match in the pumphouse,
not being acquainted with the odor of
gas that filled the room.
Sympathy for Kruger.
Berlin, July 27. -The official North
German Gazette announces that on the
death of Mrs. Kruger, on July 20, Count
von Buelow, the imperial chancellor,

Women, train yourselves to be broad

women is responsible for more harm

with high and noble interests. Petti

break the hearts of others and ruin
