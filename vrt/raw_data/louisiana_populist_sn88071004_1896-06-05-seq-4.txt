A Bicyele Aslr eang.
Bicycle girls have almost 9X4 eat
of their minds trying to keep their
hair straight, or rather eurled, for a
this case the straight way we the
wrong way. The wind and heat played
o havoc with the best euts that the
cuitlirg tongs ank patience could pro
duoe, and the feminine soorader felt
that she had either to part with her
heir or her wheel. A beneflest
genius has come to her rescue, how
ever, and Invented a bloycle iang that
is wararrnted to be water-proof and
bomb-proof. It is made of hair, ocmes
Sin all colors, and is secured to tie
i head by innumemble pins. So far it
differs not from ordinary false fronts,
but the beauty of it consists in its
having been treated to some sort of
chemical that prevents its co ling out
of curl. Winds may blow upon it,
rain may beat upon it, the wearer may
even take a header Without turning a
hair of this admirable arrangement.
The bicycle bang goe ahead e, any
.other invention yet offered the public.

Some four years ago in Teheran an
English sailor was caught in the act of
carrying off some precious stones from
the shah's palace. The thief was
brought before the "king of kings,"
who swore that next time the sailor
crossed his path he would at once be
put to death. It is a curious fact that.:
this very sailor was crossing the street
when the shah was driving in Berlin,
now some years ago, and was knocked
down and instantly killed.
Some Zulus were on exhibition in
Aberdeen and a gentleman who had
been in South Africa himself went and
began to talk with the men in their
own language. One of the natives was
exceptionally shy, which rather at

looked at him more closely and recog
nized him as a man who had worked
for him in Natal and had run away with
- a pair of trousers which did not belong
to him.

Bottled Up!
Il Whether in the form of pill powder
or liquid, the doctor's prescription for
blood diseases is always the same-
mercury or potash. These drugs bottle
up and poison and dry it up in the
system, but they also dry up the marrow
Is l the bones at the same time.
The suppleness and elasticity of the
ints give way to a stiffness, the rack
pains of rheumatism. The form
ually bends, the bones ache, while
, pitude and helplessness prema
turely take possession of the body, and
is it is but a short step to a pair of
crutches. Then comes falling of
the hair and decay of the bones,-a con
e dition truly horrible.
e POTASH Contagious Blood
POTAS Poison,-the curse
of mankind--is the
most horrible of all
diseases, and has a!
ways baffled the
I doctors. Their pot
ash and mercury
tf bottle up the poiso:i,
e but it always breakt

ing some delicate
organ, frequently
the mouth and
throat, filling them
, : with eating sores.
S.S.S., is the only
known cure for this
disease. It is guar
anteed purely vege
n table, and onethousand dollars reward is
S offered for proof to the contrary. It
never fails to cure Contagious Blood
r Poison, Scrofula, Eczema, Rheumatism,
e Cancer, or any other disease of the
blood. If you have a blood disease,
take a remedy which will not injure you.
Beware of mercury; don't do violence
