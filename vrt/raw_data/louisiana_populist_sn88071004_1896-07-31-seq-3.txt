Truth About Bryan.
Answe~ring an inquiring subscri
her, the N(:nconformist, of Indian- I
I apolis, one of the oldest and able:-t
of People's party papers, says:
C(mdor compels us to admit that '
Mr. Bryan's record on most, if not
all, public questions is in line with
Populist thought. He favors gov
ernment ownership of railroads,
income tax, government issue of
money, popular election of sena
tors, the initiative and referendum,
and, in short, the whole program- I
me. Ip these respects he is far in
r advance of the average democrat, j
and is not to be comp tred to any
of the other candidates mentioned I
before the Chicago convention.
- Teller, whom a lot of our hysteri
cal Populist leaders were so anx- i
ious to indorse, does not coincide
with the Populists except on a sin
'le point (free silver.) He is I
against the whole Populist policy
y except this one thing. Yet these I
men declared in their manifestoes .
that they would indorse Teller, I
while they would refuse to indorse I
r any other candidate. There was
neither logic nor consistency in
- their position. If persons only I
are to be considered, and agree
B ment to endorse the candidate most
in line with Populist thought Bry- I
I an stands far and away ahead of (
any old party man. The truth is A
that. Bryan has for years been far
more of a Populist than a Demo
crat, so far as his advocacy of
principles was concerned. In 1894
he co-operated actively with the
Populists in Nebraska and it was
largely due to his influence that I
f Holcomb was elected. We should
say, therefore, if Populists are go
mng into the endorsement business.
I they co:ld not ask a more accep
table candidate than Bryan. Per
sonally we can't think of a single 1
objectiou that can be urged against
him from the Populist standpoint.
e The only valid objection is that
though converted to Populist prin
t ciples he still refused to join the
( party outright and remained a I
t member of the democratic party.
This, however, is to be said in his
favor even on that point. He has
t declared repeatedly, in speech and
e published letters, that under no
Scircumtances would he support
the democratic party if it was con
trolled by the gold element and
a failed to declare fiat-footed for free
asilver coinage. This is more than
e any of the other conspicuous dem
oeratic leaders, with the exception i
1 of Tillman, had done previous to
'the convention. Blackburn, Bland,
Harris, Cockerell, Daniel and the
I whole outfit were saying up to the
rIst minute that no matter bow the
convention went or who controlled
i they were "for the ticket."
se remarks are not made for
the purpose of influencing any
e body ne way or the other, but
I simply in anSWer to -our cores
padeat's request for the truth as
to Bryan.
SJudging from the condition of
smeveral our young men on Sat

D A gentleman who does not be
lieve in being bound by any con
l vention gives us the following sto
at ry with his moral attached.
Id Years ago a darkey whose favor
o- ite pastimes were drinking whiskey
s' and playing cards attended "meet
r- ing." One parson preached about
,le the evils of intemperance, another
at preacher discoursed upon the sin
t. of gambling. A third mihister
t looking the sinner in the eye said :
ie "Bro. card playing leads to perdi
a tion, whiskey drinking will carry
Y. you to damnation, what road will
'i you take I"
s With a smile which would have
wo made Billy Kersands pale with en
rt vy, the aforesaid sinner replied:
n- "Brothers, if one road leads to
Id damnation, and the other to perdi
t tion, I think I'll take to the woods."
o- This, "said the gentleman," is
m my course. If gold will lead me
to to Republicanism and silver to
d Democracy, I'll take to the woods."
-e Now that Bryan and Watson are
he our nominees t'is bard to say
Id what he will do.
ýr A number of papers are repro
7 doting that chestnut : "Where am
I at " and accusing Hon. Thos. E.
as Watson of being its author. The
truth of the matter is that it was
uttered on the floor of the House
by Mr. -Cobb, of Alabama. Mr.
Watson only took it up and in his
usual funny way made sport of it.
i So Mr. Cobb of Alabama, is the
il author at where am I at.
