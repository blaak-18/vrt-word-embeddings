FRIDAY, MAY r4, l 9I. ..
The income tax law has been l
knocked entirely out by our admi- a
rable Supreme C'ourt. One of the le
Justices flopped since the former w
decision, ibut we are not informed tl
how much he is ahead by the trans- aI
action. n
Some of our acqalntances don't
like us because we "foresaw evil
and turned therefrom," but "thank
Heaven," in the new world we will o
not be judged lby the wicked of
Winn parisl.- Excelsior.
"Some!" Why Smith, the half
of them have not yet expressed g
themselves to you, because they c.
don't consider you worth an ex
pression. Not only your acquaint
anoes and former friends, but even
strangers, despise a traitor andll
backslider, and your hope that "in
the new world" it will not be so, is t
doubtless all the consolation your to
great ante-type, Benedict Arnold,
had. 8
The Winfield Excelsior says: r
"There is some talk in foreign v
countries that James B. Eustis,
enbessador to France, will possi
bly be a candidate for the presiden
cy of the United States in the next
national election." This verifies '
the statement that Wind has for- s
ever and eternally ceded from the a
union of States, reconstruction
notwithstanding. If not, why
does Editor Smith persist in look
int on the Distriet of Columbia as c
a "foreign country l" Brother, the a
suggestion of Mr. Eustis for the
presideney ori~nated, and in all
probability will end in a propos
tion made by the Washington Post.

Some Populitic Nonuente.
The Populistic newspapers of 11
the Fourth Congressional District, h,
:and ClxK.ially the People's l)e
mdants and The %V inutieli ('omrade. tl
are raging because the 'I'own Talk a
favors and indorses the proposed 4
suffrage amendment to the consti- si
tution of this State.
The Populists seitem to be a unit
in their opposition to the proposel d
amendmtent. They are shouting ce
ballot reformers, but they want '
that kind of ballot reform that will b
turn Louisiana over to the negroes t
and the ignorant whites.--Town
Talk.
Nonsense; of course, it would'nt
be Populistic if it was'nt nonsense.
The adjective "Populistic" does'ut e
describe anything that isn't non
sense. It is sad, however, that
such a great man as Bro. McCor
mick should have been fooled into
supporting free silver, another 1
piece of Populistic nonsense.
"The Populists seen to be a unit
in their opposition to the proposed
amendment." Correct, Bro. Mac.,
they voted as a unit against it in
the State legislature, and will do t
the same next Spring.
But that is more than you can I
say of your party on any question.
You seem to be constitutionally
opposed to voting as a unit, and
that is why so many people have
left you and gone into a party
which can vote as a unit upon the
things it professes to lx liove. We
are a unit from Maine to Califor
nia. having "one faith, one Lord
and one baptism," and we vote that
way in congress and out of it; and,
Mac. did you know that such a
course is winning the respect and
confidence of all stable, sound
minded people
If your platform was ever so
good, which is not so, your party
can't stay together long enough to
vote for it. But then that is be
cause of approaching dissolution.
"A house divided against itself,
etc.
Now as to the Populists wanting
the negro vote, would you please
tell us what they want with it?
They have about all the white votes
except, perhaps those that have
. ruined the Democratic party, and
would ruin any other.
Your bare assertions being
worthless, the best evidence of who
t wants the negro vote is the fellow
who is found in possesion of the
- stolen goods. After you aided;
abetted and encouraged the stealing
1 of 2000 negro votes at 7 precincts
in your parish last November, and
s condoned it in your own eyes by
a saying, a few days after, that it
a was gratifying to see the negroes
on election day walk up and vote
the Democratic ticket; after the
Populists offered to submit their
e tickcet and yours to a white prima
a ry, and thus legally and honorably
tfree the country from the negro
Svote, and you refused, without be
ing able to give agood reason
for it; after you saw your case
b hopeless at 12 o'clock on election
. day, and telegraphed to every box
. in the district that you could reach
- by wire, to "open the throttle
* valves or we are gone," and they
were opened, belching you forth
in . parishes 7000 negro votes
Sthat never went to the polle--after
Sall this and more, even blacker, it
a takes a good deal of brass and

- ole above clipped,
A Areslsmart man would not do

Don't imagine they are states
men, Bro. Smith, just because they
can "down" you so completely
with speech or pen; they needl not a
be very learned in statesmanship (
to o that. t
While we know that some of the
bigfcest fools in America abide in t
Winn iaridh, (your paper gives e
evidence of that) we also know
that a big majority of her citizens
belong to that class of people from
which Washington, Franklin, Jet- f
ferson, Jackson, Lincon, and near- t
lv all truly great and patriotic
statesmen of our nation were ta
ken. They breathe the same pure,
free country air, have their brains
as well as muscles developed and
strengthened by the same honest
toil, are governed and actuated by
the same simple, yet broad princi
pie of the golden rule, "equal
rights to all and special favors to
none"; and when the emergency
calls upion them to display the
same energy and patriotism, they
will be found answering their
country's call with the same bril
liant statesmanship that character
ized the heroes above named, while
you, Bro. Smith, continuing your
present role of backslider, can but
hope to equal the infamy of Bene
dict Arnokl.

Speaker Crisp declared for free
silver, but the people are advocates
of Lax-o-lin, the best remedy for
constipation and irregularities of
the bowels and digestion.--Jack
sonian.
To those who know Speaker
Crisp's record, hi~s simple declara
tion for free silver is the best cure
for constipation of the bowels that
we have ever heard of, and we
think that "the people" had better
hang on to it, as Laxolin might
prove a less certain remedy.
Col's Financial Fools.
Among the innumerable host
that has "answered" Coin is one
Horace White, the dude editor of
the New York Evening Post. Hor
ace's book recalls somebody's re
mark about puns, that some of
them were so infernally had as to
be good. It deserves the praise,
if that be worth anything of be
ing one of the best books ever
written on the wrong side of a
question of which the writer is
profoundly ignorant. The best
thing about it is its unconscious
humor. Worthless of itself,
White's production is good dramati
cally, like the chattering of the
fool in the play of "King Lear" or
the misplaced words of Mrs. Part
ington. Horace, for instance, is
greatly shocked at the liberties
Coin "takes with prominent per
sonages. He informs us gravely
that Coin is not the fifteen-year
old boy that he represents himself,
but a grown man with whiskers.
Horace also solemnly avers that he
did not give any lectures, as the
book purports, and that the per
sons who were quoted as present
were, in fact, not present. In or
rder to enable himself to make this
Spoint against Coin with crushing
, effect, White went to the troubble
of writing to Lyman Gage, Pro
Sfessor Laughlin and others who are
t indroduced into the "Financial
I ISchool" and exultantly publishes
Stheir letters denying that they had
ever attended any such lectures.
This, of course, settles Coin and
, proves with all the logic of idiocy
I that his arguments about silver,
I based on oicial records, can't pos
Smibly be true. And this precious
u, which it would be an extrav
agant compliment to call nonsense,
B isone of the documents sent out
t by that self-styled New York "Re
form Club" to stay the free siver
wave. Like other books sent out
Sby that gang it is valuable as show
is how hIttle can be msid in behalf
o the sinle gold standard. As
-the argumeat progrsse it will be
Sfoand that that neweet as well as
worst discovery in Bfnaee has not
a ietostand on and that ad lthe
fali ty in the world annot succeed
tting up a justioation for it.

Somewhat Rattlled.
In another pilne in this pae"r
will hle founl a letter from a cor
reslpondent who signs himself
"Populist."
Our friend must 1e considerably
rattled or he could not advocate
the plan he does of putting down
ballot-box stuffing, . retaining at
the same time the organization of
the Populist party intact, and if
he remains true to the party that
his signature indicates he belongs
he certainly is the possessor of
some strange visions.
The plans submitted by our
friend will never he accepted by
the Populist party, because, in the
first place they- are not altogether
practicable, and secondly, if the
rank and file of the Democratic
party could have maintained un- i
molested control of the organiza
tion, keeping it from drifting so
far away from the basic princi
ples of its pristine moorings, we
would have had little cause for
leaving the Democratic party and
organizing a new one.
The Democrats could count the
Populists out just as easily and
with just as much impunity in the
primary as they could in the gene
ral election.
When thieves steal among them
selves as the Democrats are known
to do in this state an outsider would
stand about as much chance of fair
play when delivered into their
hands as a snow flake would in the
t locality where the brimstone burn
eth and the fire dieth not.
In the campaign of 1892, Mc
' Enery was counted out in the pri
mary, and the fraud was so very
r flagrant that his friends would not
submit without protest. McEnery
ran the race through to the finish,
s polling upon a fair count, a majori
ty of the legal votes cast, but was
again counted out.
Here in this district no longer
Sthan last fall Watkins, a Democrat,
' was counted out in a primary elec
Stion where only white people were
e allowed to participate, by Demo
Scrats.
Under such records as these, the
Populists could not expect any
thing other than to be counted out,
even if they were permitted to
participate in the primary election
our friend advocates.
SSometimes this strategy business
Swill work and sometimes it won't;
it generally won't, except in favor
d of the other fellow.
SBy strategy the Farmer's Alli
ance was qomg to swallow up the
Democratic party in the last con
Stest, but to her amazement when
' the time came for the swallowing
process to be proceded with the
Democratic pary turned the ta
bles and the Alliaace was placed
' full inside and below the belt of
t the old she devil in less time than
it takes to relate it.
SIt may as well be understood
now as later on that the Populists
will never so far forget themselves
as to surrender our position and
Sdestroy the identity of our organi
sation by grounding arwms, run
ning up the white flag, and crawl
Sing am cringing before the bonses
like fawning sycophants bgging
for restoration, in equal footing,
and a fair chance.
This we would be forced todo
Sif we adopted the pl msubmitted
fI by our friend, Populist.-Comrade.
