be very cearly set forth and understood
that there is no method for detachieg a

TA~ PUBLIC SCJIOOS OF
LAFA YETTE.
That Lafayette parish has in
creased the efficiency of its public
schools; that it is constantly im
proving and adopting more effective
methods; that a healthier sentiment
in favor of good schools is gaining
additional impetus, year after year,
are facts that the subjoined figures
fully attest.
Let it be remembered that the
Parish of Lafayette covers an area
of only 30 miles both ways, and in
consequence the wards are small.
The report of the parish superin
tendent shows an increase in attend
ance as follows : In x889 there were
only 579 children enrolled in the
public schools; in x89o, 939; in
g89g, 955; and, in 1892 the in
crease showed the healthy growth
.f soSo, a gain of nearly o50 per
cent. in a littlp over three years.
At the beginning of 1889 the par
- sh owned no school houses in the
garish, except a delapidated struc
ture in Broussardville, which when
sold brought $25, and an unfinished
louse in the town of Lafayette.
To-day the parish has so good
school houses, of which 4 are rent
ed and z6 belongs to the parish,
z5 being erected since 2889, as fol
lows; In x889, I in the first ward;
a in the second ward ; i in the fifth
ward; and 3 in the sixth ward. In
1890 we find there was built z in the
second ward and r in the eighth
ward. In 189z these had been in
creased to z in the second ward ;
in the seventh ward; and z in the
eighth ward. In 1892, I in the
fourth ward, and in x893 z in the
third ward, making r6 houses be
longing to the parish.
Out of an enrollment of io8o the
average attendance was 552, taught
by a z teachers. And right here we
desire to say that Lafayette makes
a splendid showing in the small num
ber of teachers employed for the
large number of children enrolled;
this, according to the report of the
State Superintendent of Public Edu
cation, is a much better showing
than most parishes, and as good as
ihe best.
While the attendance is not as
large as it should be, it shows a
marked increase from former years.
In this matter of forwarding the
interests of the public schools of
the parish while much praise is due
the very eflicient parish superinten
cent and the school board, it must
not beforg6tten that the Police Jury
has been an important factor. Out
of the general so mills tax levied in
the-parish, the Police Jury has con
tributed substantial aid.
So it. will be seen that the people
Irve by no means been neglectful of
their educational facilities, and the
achools are so sitrated that they are
within accessible distance of alL
But this ik not all. If we are to
fudge the atuite by the past, and in
--asamuch as some of the wards have
~tshree schools now, it is within
e. -o. to predictfhat in a few years
b ad will have from three to
SIs thns afording the am
- oiportunity of securing for
' cry Child in the parish an educa
-- this connection it may not be
-o state that the High School I
in the town of Lafayetteiis r
pletiion, and when fin- t
ishdt will be a' striking momnuent
to the intelligence and enterprise of
r the people. Pot the building of this
magnifieent temple of learning the
people went down into their pockets
and contributed the handsome sum
of $8oo, and this amount was in
creased by generous donations from
the Police Jury and City Council.
Every thing is paid up on the build
ing, and there is yet some $30 or $40
- to the credit of the old fund, and
besides $5 oo lately donated by the
Police Jury and City Council and
turned over to the treasuxrer.
The Gazette firmly believes that
in a few .years Lafayette will be able
to show more and better schools
than any parish in the State, and
will afford as fine an opportunity to
obtain an education as any place in
the older States, and will earn the
claim of having more schools to
the population and area than any
other county in the United States.
We shall speak of the- town pri.
vate schools in a future article.
IMMIGRA TION.
This immigration problem will
not down. It sits like the fable
skeleton even at the festive board.
At the New England dinner in the
city of New York, lately Chauncey
M. Depew brought it into his speech
in this wise: "We should keep out
the pauper, the diseased and the vi
cious, but welcome those who flee
from oppression; those who seek to
better their condition. We should
admit their vigorous, the industri
ous, the honest and the healthy."
Now, to use a trite New England
expression, we guess that is about as
a small potatoes in the sense of sizing
up the necessities as we have grown
on our American soil so far. - That
t would admit any number of work
f ing people who might choose to
come; and foreign news correspond
Sence informs us that the rage to
come to American has received fresh
impetus by the announcement that
t restriction is imminent. Every
t mother's son and every father's
daughter of them wants to benefit
his condition. Certainly.
But how about the condition of
the millions of their predecessors
and their children, born here; and
i how about the condition of the
American workman with five to eight
generations of native parents, and
grand and great grand parents back
of them, if this flood is not checked?
That's what we want to know.
OUR SAY
This is about the time of year
when the press feels called upon to
give the farmer some advice in re
gard to agriculture. The latter .are
generally chary of its acceptance,
however. Still to be in "the swim" 1
The Gazette must put in its oar. Irm
primis, our first mistake (the planters) a
is to cultivate our lands so as to get 1
the most out of them without any 4
reference to the future, and, as a
result, the lands are proving less c
productive, every year, and we begin
to suspect that we are advancing a c
la crawf js-fertilizing is the rem- f
edy that will effect a cure every time. c
Secondly, we are dependant too v
much on a single crop-diversity of c
crops must be the rule. Thirdly, v
the old ruts must be forsaken-new v
ideas and better methods must be d
adopted. Fourthly, better tillage is e
necessary. Fifthly, and lastly, we s
must learn the economies of the farm.
Now follow strictly these rules, and
if in due course of time you don't find
yourself far ahead of your present
condition, just come to this office,
call us way off in a corner where no
one can hear us, and call us an addle
pated-. a
SOME POU L TRY FIGURES. a
The poultry products had a farm I
value of at least $aoo,ooo,ooo last r
year, notes the Secretary of Agricul- c
ture, and no less than z6,ooo,ooo p
dozen eggs were imported, at first c
cost of more than z5 cts per dozen, 1
or nearly 2,5oo~,ooo, while thep
average value of importation during I
the past four years has been $2,2z6,- g
326. An exchange adds th.t the t
figures given by Secretary Rusk only n
cover farm poultry and fancy fowls v
marketed. That which is used by c
the producer is not taken into con-l
sideration, and $65o,ooo,ooo is '1
nearer the actual figure, according p
to the estimate made by the most 1
reliable experts. From reports which e
have been received from 63 breeders, p
who average 7t hens each, it is C
found that their hens paid them 97 s
cents per head clean profit last year. o
This was at market prices for chicks E
and eggs. u
" Hr/ IS NO 7" 7'h FASIIOIN."
How often do we hearthisexpres
sion' in regard to some question re
lating to the merits of some young
man. "Oh! yes, it cannot be denied V
thathe is upright, fairly educated, cc
t and of unblemished private charac
f ter;but he is not the fasAioa.'. Alas,
s it is a fact, that modest merit of the
e brightest order is too often suffered
5 to perish by cold neglect, while lft
3 pudent mediocrity makes its way
- with e/dal into the good graces and
2 affection of those who are the fashion.
No matter in what one may excel;
though he be highly endowed with
> a bright intellect, and the purity of
I his morals unquestioned, if he be
not enrolled among the votaries of
I fashion, he is cast aside and too
often spurned. Unfortunately for
t him he is not in possession of that
brazse talisman, which seldom fails
to be an open sesame. " No, modest
merit, has not that irresistable confi
dence and assurance-impudence,
that precious metal which is better
than gold. In short "he is not the
fashion."
STAY SO UTH.
Telegraphic' espatches announce
that the people of the Dakotas and
the far west are again in the throes
of a blizzard, and that the cold is in
tense. Those of our people who
sometimes think of going West proba
bly have no conception of that sec
tion of our country; the deadly cold
in winter, the terrible prairie fires,
and the destroying cyclone. If they
t have read of them they will probably
turn from the perusal, satisfied that
our own highly favored South is good
enough for him, and that the much
I praised West has no charms. Why
should any one wish to leave the
safe and comfortable South for the
I perilous and unsettled IVest? The
I South has already all that the
:West is striving for, and a climate
so much better in every respect that
t comparison would be odious.
And the people of the West who
are experiencing all those terrible
inconveniences did they but have a
faint knowledge of the actual con
ditions ofthings in the South,and par
ticularly in Southwestern Louisian a,
where the climate is so mild through
out the year; where the soil is so
prolific; where the cost of living is
so cheap; where every condition to
make life happy, contented and pros
perous exist in abundance, how long
would it be before they would turn
their faces Southward? Not long.
Let these advantages be made
known. Let those people know the
truth about our sunny south. We
want them to come, and they will
come, but they will not come unin
vited.
TILE IMMIGRATION CON
VENTION.
This meeting of the representative
men of the State can not fail to be
productive of much good. It will
be no task for them to prepare
a statement, which by the recital of
actual facts must prove attractive to
the home seeker as welll as to the
capitalist.
Louisiana is practilcally a new
country with a soil of great fertility,
vast areas of which have never been
cultivated; a climate the most health
ful and genial, both furnishing in
ducements and opportunities that
will be accepted; besides, lands are
cheap, productiveness considered, t
very cheap. And the immigrant
who is in search of just such con
ditions, when apprised that such
exist will not be slow to avail them
selves of them.
TILE CARENCRO BRANC II
ROAD.
We call the attention of The Ga
zette readers to our Carencro letter i
published elsewhere. In it will be f
seen that the grading and building of
the branch road connecting Carencro
and Arnaudville will soon commence,
and will be hurried to completion. t
As our correspondent adds, "it willi
run through the most fertile section
of the parish, and will undoubtedly
prove of inestimable value to Caren,
cro and bring us in contact with a c
large area that now is wholly de- I
pendant on the Teche for the trans
portation of its produce. It will
greatly enhance the value of property
through which it will run, and will a
no doubt prove a very succesful and g
valuable investment; all the property
owners," as the Gazette announced Ik
last week, "have promised the a
'right of way' and doing all in their s
power to encourage the enterprise.
Yes, friends, we are keeping our
eye on Canencro" and will note with 1
pleasure its onward march. That
Carenco is destined to be a town of
some importance in a few years is
one of the certainties of the future. t
Every section of the parish is on the i
upward march, and Carencro is keep
ing abreast with the procession. 1
While the deaths in Marseilles,
France, number scores daily from i
something very like cholera, survi
vors are welcome to extract what tl
comfort they niay from uedical assu- I
Srakctthat the malady is not choleta,
but o istation. However, there

'8. M. A. AtEETItG.
The Business Men's Association
met in regulaq session Wednesday
evening, at Falk's Hall, with C. O.
; Mouton, president, presiding.
The coammittee of five on rail
f roads, presented, through theii
chairman, Mr. Julian Mouton, their
report, which says that the com
mittee had decided to employ the
servides of a competent person, to
r ascertain the assessed value of prop
t erty of every qualified voter in the
parish, which when done, it was
the intention of the committee to
t send to every voter, a circular,
showing thFe assessed valuation of
his property, and the amount con
sequent thereon that he would be
called upon to pay should the rail
road tax be levied. The report was
adopted.
The same committee was then ins
tructed to assign the membership of
the association, as committees,
to the several wards, for the pur
s pose of obtaining signatur.s to a
petition asking the Police Jury,
at its next sitting, to order an elec
tion to obtain the will of the voters
on the proposed railroad tax.
A communication, from Mr. H.
I VanderCruysen, the general agent
of the Teche and Vermilion Tele
phone company, was read, asking
that if the town of Lafayette would
donate a bonus. of $25o, to their
company it would, at an early date,
I extend the line to this town. After
reading thereof a committee of three
composed of Messrs. Ordway, Camp
bell and Julian Mouton, was ap
pointed to look into and communi
cate with Mr. VanderCruysen in re
gard to the matter.
Mayor Campbell read a letter of
inquiry from Mr. Taylor of New
Iberia, which letter the Secretary
was authorized to answer.
Whereupon the meeting adjourned
to meet on the 2oth instant.
The Ga zette acknowledges receipt
of a copy of the first edition of the
St. . Martinsville Evangeline, pub
lished by Mr. C. Greig former pub
lisher of the Revielle-which latter
establishment was burnt out some
time ago.
REDIVIVUS BOTTOM.
Lafayette is going to have another news
paper. Messrs. C. A. Thomas and Homer
J. Mouton will. be at the helm. The Vindic
ator wishes the new concern success, and we
venture the prediction at the same time that
somebody is going to get more experience
than they have any use for. Lafayette, with its
present population and surroundings, will not
support two papers. The strongest will stand
the blast of the hurricane but the weak must
be swept away. The Vindicator has been
there and It knows whereof itspeaks.-Atta
pas Viindicator.
As this is the second "prediction"
of failure made by the Vindicator in
regard to the new paper, evidently
the wish is father to the thought.
That the editor has some grievance
against the people of Lafayette, the
cause whereof we are ignorant, is
clearly apparent. That he should
wish us success in one breath and in
the next hope that we will not
achieve it is a corollary seemingly
necessary to make the kick hard. I
En passant we may add that it failed
of its purpose. But frankly, Alpha,
in assuming the character of Casan- I
dra, you will find that you are out
of your sphere. To preserve the
eternal fitness of things better stick
to the role designed by nature for i
you, that of Bottom, the weaver.
TIIE UNITED STA TES
MARSILAL.
We have heard with much pleasure,
that Mr. Jules J. Mouton of this
Parish has been mentioned in con
nection with the office of United j
States Marshal, for this disdrict of
Louisiana. We are sure that no
better man and Democrat can be
found to fill that high position. His 7
name is a familiar one, and has been t
eminently connected with the history 1
of La., and as a man he has always
shown himself a true decendant of
that distinguished patriot of the Par
ish of Lafayette, the Hen. Alex. i
Mouton. As a Democrat his un
swerving fealty and support to that
party is a well established fact. To
him and men like him do the people
of the Parish of St. Martin owe the '
honor of being the Banner Dem- a
ocratic Parish of this State. Our
Representatives in Congress would
do themselves much honor insecuring t
his appointment to the office of U. t
S. Marshal.-St Marlinsville Evan- e
geline.
We know Jules J. Mouton, we have
known him from childhood; a better
man, a more sincere friend, a more
stalwart Democrat does not exist,
and should he receive the appoint
ment the office frill have at its head t
an officer that will fulfill to the u
letter every demand. "
PAR Sf1 OF LAFA Y TTE.
Relative perfection in several par
ticulars, and Eot in all, to be found
in Lafayette parish, suggests the
conclusion that it is an ideal parish
in more than one feature.
The first of these qualities is its
deep, rich bl.ck prairie soil, carry
ing with it the fertility of the Miss
issippi river bottom lands, without
their danger of annual inundations.
It enj)'S t1.e bcncfi:s of being prai- g
t, rie without suffering from the cold,
e wet soil of the many coulbes and
c low plices of the Catreme southwest
ern corner of the prairie section.
It enjoys the cooling and fragrant
gulf breeze without its storm dangers.
n It is high, dry and healthful, with
Y out being upon the poor lands of the
hills. It needs no fertilizer, and
L- 7 per cent of it is not available for
1 immediate use.
it While the average cultivated area
of Louisiana is only about so per
cent of its total area, Lafayette
parish enjoys the distinction of hayv
e ing 54 per cent of its entire rich
s soil producing its multiplied fruits
0 of corn, cane, cotton and rice in un
j surpassed quantities for man's daily
use. It*is not believed that such
e a high percentage in cultivation is
- found anywhere else in the southern
states. While this is true, there is
. another extra strong feature in its
f condition of to-day, and that is, while
Louisiana has only twenty-five in
~ habitants to the square mile, making
L a close and well settled parish afford
ing fine neighboring school and
s church possibilities.
The people are small home-owners,
with but few renters and less debt
- and mortgages, and while not bril
liantly prosperous, are in altogether
I easy and comfortable circumstances.
r Their want of brilliant prosperity is
due to themselves. The soil, the
climate and general conditions are
- such that a living is made without
- much effort and, without any modern
- advantages, and for these reasons
- but few fortunes have been accumu
lated by the people, though good
round estates are to be found in the
hands of several men, one being rated
in commercial agencies at $r s,
I ooo, to $2oo,ooo, and these are the
examples of more energy and pro
t gressiveness than is enjoyed by the
masses of the parish, and constitute
eloquent testimonials of the richness
of the soil.
* * * * *
A great boom is expected in school
methods in the near future, as the
people of Lafayette, aided by a lib
r eral city council and police jury,
have nearly completed their 30ox7o
foot two-story, 6-room, high school '
t building on a beautiful school ground
of x5o by 250 feet in size, costing,
when completed, about $3ooo. The
grounds, or the largest part thereof,
were donated by Dr. Hopkins.
The parish has a white population
of 8998 and a colored population of
6966, of which 43 per cent are school
children. The parish has transpor
tation facilities east and west, and
north by the Morgan Railroad, and
south by the navigation via the Ver
million river to the gulf.
The officers of the parish are:
Isaac Broussard, sheriff; W. B. Bai
ley, clerk; WVm. Clegg, treasury;
W. B. Torian, president of the police
jury; Overton Cade, member of the
legislature. The court house is a
frame building of thirty or forty
years of age, but the clerk office is a
model brick structure, with fire-proof
vaults for every official . department
of the parish. There is no floating 1
debt or bonds due by the parish and
its paper or warrants are at par.
(Description of the town of La
fayette on the local page.)
The second largest town is Royville
(poist office known as Youngsville),
which has a population of 5oo and
about ten business house in an ad
jacent to it. It has a new school
house with fifty children in school,
with twenty-five more to attend soon.
This is its first public school. The
town is near the corner of Lafayette,
Vermillion, Iberia, and St. Martin f,
parishes. c
Carencro is the third largest town r4
in the parish and is located' on the n
northern branch of the Morgan re
Railroad and has a population of -
289 and about twenty business houses
in and adjacent to it. It also has a
good public school.
Broussard is the fourth largest
town in the parish and is located on
the Morgan Railroad, nine miles
east of Lafayette, and has a popula
tion of 75 and six busines houses in
and near by it and a good public
school.
Scott is the least of the towns and
is a few miles west of Lafayette on -
the Morgan Railroad and has a pop
ulation of 50 and four business
houses.
Everything considered, there are
many extraordinary advantages in
Lafayette parish. Cheap and rich
lands, hospitality and a good people:
big crops and fine.health; no floods
or pestilence, or such features as
should make any man glad to move
with his family into this agricultual -
paradise of four staple crops--cane,
corn, cotton and rice.--Z. Ii. fazr- ias
