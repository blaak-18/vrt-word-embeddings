any way disordered, the whole body,
and not only the body, but the mind,
sympathizes with the disturbed or

common than any other disease ; and
to remove the bile, as well as to reg

take Simmons' Liver Regulator, which

Important to Land Owners.
Parties owning bodies of land which
they wish to dispose of to IMMI
GRANTS, will do well to avail them
selves of this splendid offer.
LAND OWNERS
IN RED RIVER, SABINE, WINN,
VERNON OR NATCHITOCHES,
who desire land advertised for sale
to immigrants, can have the same
done in the VINDICATOR-STATING
LOCALITY, CIIARACTER OF SOIL, IM
PROVEMENTS, WATER, QUALITY AND
PIucE, on the co-opperative plan, I. E.
we will charge regular rates for the
advertisement, and take pay as fol
lows; ONE IIALF CASH, the other
half when the land is sold.
By this moans we become interest
ed in the sale of the land with the
owner, and will give our personal at
tention to answering all inquiries re
lating thereto.
We hope our friends throughout
the section named, will give their at
tention to this matter.
The great need of Louisiana at
this time is Capital, Immigration and
Intclhgent Labor. Capital, to invest
in our Mineral and Agricultural lande,
" .. .. . ."IwUalwinrIu perniln -
nently settle thereon, and Intelligent
labor to develop our resources.
Why cannot we compete with our
sister States in inducing the one and
the locating of the other ? Our lands
are cheap, rich and productive, pro
ducing the great staples of the world,
viz: cotton, sugar, tobacco, and all
the small grains. Nowhere on the
continent does fruit conic to such per
fection; oranges, apples, peaches,
pears and grapes, together with all
the smaller varieties, are produced in
abundance. Our climate is healthy
and salubrious; our seasons are mild
and even. Nature has been kind to
us in all ways, and all tlhat remains
now to be done, that oui land may
prosper, is that Capital and Labor
may be induced to come among us.
The first will find a rich field to re
ward it, and the latter will be hearti
ly welcomed.
We conclude that all will see the
great advantage of advertising, in
order to lay before the people of the
bleak North, and the barren Atlantic
board, the elysiuP that awaits the
hardy, industrious immigrant, in
Louisiana.
Let land owners show faith by
works and give as a trial.
