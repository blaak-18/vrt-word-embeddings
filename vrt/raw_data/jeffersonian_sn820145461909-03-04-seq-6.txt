LETTERS THE PEOPLE
LIKE GEORGE BELL, HE CLAIMS
HE WAS ROUGHLY TREATED.
Fails in An Endeavor to Get the
Grand Jury to Investigate Miss
ing Sorghum Mill.
If the stories told by B. G. Camp,
a farmer and carpenter, living at Pin
son’s Station, twelve miles north of
here, are true, then Hades is a sum
mer resort compared to the State San
itarium for the Insane at Milledge
ville. Mr. Camp was confined there
for 48 days seven years ago, but the
experience he says he underwent, are
still so fresh in his mind that he can
not speak of them without weeping.
Mr. Camp claims that he has been
defrauded of a sorghum mill and
some other property by certain peo
ple in the county, and has been un
successfully endeavoring to get the
grand jury to take the matter up.
He thinks lawyers, courts and all are
leagued in a conspiracy against him.
He has been deferred from seeking
legal redress before, he says, by
threats of sending him back to Mil
ledgeville, and he declares that he
had rather die and go to hell at once
than be sent back to the sub-station
there.
George H. Bell, former legislator
and editor of the Swainsboro Blade,
has been making similar charges
against the State sanitarium of late,
and the remarks of Mr. Camp come
as a confirmation of the former law
maker, who declares that he is sane
and is seeking to be freed.
The story that Camp, a white-hair
ed, gray-bearded old man, told The
Tribune-Herald Saturday morning be
tween sobs that shook his body, would
require the pen of Edgar Allan Poe
for proper presentation, and makes
Dante’s Inferno read like a sonnet of
love and moonlight in comparison.
Said he, and whether the story was
true or not, he was in earnest, “I
was in the sanitarium at Milledge
ville once and I had rather die than
go back there. Some days they kill
as many as seven people, just because
the crazy folks do not do to suit
them. I did not do to suit them, and
they got after me. They hung me
up off the floor by my neck and by
my one hand. Sometimes they would
hang me by one foot and one hand.
‘‘When I would not do to suit
them they would come in and choke
me. Then they would put me on the
floor and would stick their knees in
my side. They did this so much that
I now have a disease of the liver on
one side and am permanently injured
on the other.
“Another way, they have of doing
is to take all your clothes away. One
freezing cold night they put me in a
room without a rag of clothing, and
I almost froze stiff before morning.
The windows to the room were all
open and I could not put them down,
because there was a wire screen over
them. There was an open transom,
and I tried all night to jump up and
close that, but it was too high above
my head.
“Now when anybody wants to run
it over me they say I am crazy and
they will send me back to Milledge
ville. Then I have to leave out, for
J will die before I go back there.”
THE DESERTER MENTIONED IN
“BETHANY.”
Douglas, Ga., Feb. 19,1909.
I have been noticing for some time
in The Jeffersonian the references in
regard to the above. The dear com
rade referred to was a member of my
company—-Co. K, 29th Regt. Ga. Vol.
His name was Elias Chapman, “Old
Red,” as we all called him. A braver
or truer man never wore the gray. I
will not tell all about it now, nor
never will unless it is necessary. Old
Red never deserted his country. He
left from Savannah, Ga., went out
west, joined the Confederate cavalry
and was doing good service in that
line of service. W. H. Young was }
Colonel; W. D. Mitchell was Lieut.
Colonel; J. D. Knight was Captain.
My regiment was ordered from Poko
taligo, S. C., to go west and reinforce
Gen. Pemberton at the siege of Vicks
burg. On arriving at Jackson, Miss.,
we boys soon found “Old Red,” or Qt
least I did. I told him to keep quiet,
but he came to visit the old 29th, as it
was called. The Captain recognized
him and had him arrested, court mar
tia'led and shot. I was told by the
Orderly Sergeant that I was drawn as
one of the men to do the shooting.
I said to him: “I joined the army
to shoot Yankees and I will never pull
a trigger at Old Red.” He says, “You
will.” I says, “I won’t; I will shoot
you first.” Old Red was shot, blind
folded. Oh, I feel so sorry that such
things have been resurrected.
More anon.
Rev. A. B. Finley,
Co. K, 29th Regt. Ga. Vol.
(Ed. Note: We did not mean to
say that the soldier, Chapman, was
a deserter. Our idea of a deserter is
a soldier who goes over to the enemy.
We used the incident to illustrate
the horrors of war.)
‘ ‘ CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE TO
GIVE UP NOW.”
r __________
Bastrop, La.
Dear Mr. Watson: Enclosed find
one dollar, for which send the weekly
Jeffersonian to address of Doctor
Whetstone, Oak Ridge, La.
The Populists must- be up and doing
It would be criminal negligence for
them to give up at this stage of the
game. The principles for which they
have so long fought are beginning to
take root, but unless still watered by
their sacrifice and labor would soon
perish from the face of the earth, for
we cannot depend upon reformers of
the Roosevelt or Bryan type to carry
forward any real reforms.
Let the party begin to reorganize
upon a solid basis, by ascertaining
how much each Populist is willing to
contribute to the cause of reorganiz
ations, for without money nothing can
be accomplished.
One sister proposes that each con
tribute five cents a month. That is
well, but many would contribute much
more.
I -am old with not much energy
for the battles of life, with my finan
ces in a like crippled condition, but I
will contribute $5 the present year
and $lO each year after this until the
polls close in 1912. Now let the Pop-
Jeffersonian
ulists every where say what they are
goifig to 4o about financing the cause
and let them go about doing it. Wish
ing the Jeffersonians much success, I
am, Yours truly,
Laura Shelton.
‘ ‘ GREENBACKERS CAN ’ T DO
WITHOUT THE JEFFER
SONIANS.”
3103 Hobart Boulevard,
Los Angeles, Cal.
G. Major Taber, 3103 Hobart Boule
vard, Los Angles, Cal., Thanks for
sending me a notice that my subscrip
tion was due. How do you suppose an
old G'reenbacker of more than 40
years’ standing could do without the
Jeffersonians? I have lived in the
Sou-tii and have the honor of having
had a grandmother who was a Davis,
and a cousin of Jefferson Davis. I
take several magazines, but I enjoy
the Jeffersonian above them all. En
closed find $2.00 for both paper and
magazine.
“THE TRAIL HAS BEEN BLAZED;
LET US FOLLOW IT.”
Cheneyville, La., Feb. 8, 1909
Dear Sir: I enclose you one dollar,
post-office order, for a renewal of my
subscription to “The Jeffersonian.”
To say “it is worth the money,” is
but a feeble compliment, for it is re
freshing each week to see or know that
there is one editor and writer in our
country who not only pretends to fight
in the interest of the people, but ac
tually and at all times, stands boldly
for the rights of the commonality,
showing up the greed, craftiness and
rascality of those whose wealth has so
long dominated and used all branches
of the government in corrupt ways,
simply for the purpose of adding to
their abnormal greed and desire to ob
tain and possess riches.
After reading the short and incis
ive editorials each week in The Jeffer
sonian, it affords me great pleasure to
read the various letters from the cor
respondents therein; and note that
“there are others,” who, like myself,
are pleased with “our Tom” and take
pleasure in saying so; still, after two
or three years of such reading, I have
formed the opinion that there is con
tained in such cummunications a fine
field for the study of human nature;
and am forced thereby to believe that
Burns, the Scott, truly sized up hu
manity when he wrote the sentence:
“For mankind is an unco squad and
little to be trusted.”
This criticism, however, is not in
tended to give offence, but is simply
the result of comparison between the
expressions of the writers generally,
anti the results as shown by an actual
count of the votes cast at each presi
dential or state election. Before such
occurences the writers turn with zeal
and earnestness in their seeming
ation for the People’s Party and their
detestation of the G. O. P’s.; but
after, out of the millions of votes ex
pected, we find ourselves doomed to
defeat and disappointment, because
only a corporal’s guard showed the
courage of their convictions and had
voted as they formerly preached.
The farmers of the Southern States
are far more intelligent than they
were during the days of “reconstruc
tion,” but we can not declare they
are, as a rule, more independent. At
one time they seemed proud that they
voted the Democratic ticket because
their fathers or grandfathers had
voted it.” It is seldom indeed that
one can hear such ignorance express
ed in this day; but it is not so un
common to hear: “I voted the Demo
cratic ticket because I did not see any
chance for t’other fellow;” or, I
voted it “because I was afraid the
Republicans might get in and would
set up Negro rule,” or give some other
excuse taught him by ward bosses or
political heelers of the so-called
‘ ‘ Democratic ’ ’ party.
It is the want of independence, such
as ought to rule and dominate all
American patriots, that allows ward
politicians to find easy prey, and be
so successful in controlling the great
mass of our Southern voting popula
tion, and until true independence is
instilled and forced into the marrow
and brain of the working and farming
people of our land, new ideas and po
litical doctrines can not take such
root as will grow and forever elimin
ate all traces of theold “party collar”
and shackles, which has for forty
years or more bound them to the Jug
gernautic car yclept Democratic party.
We farmers growl and grunt be
cause of the ills we bear; we cuss, dis
cuss and recuss the condition we are
in; we resolve and resolute, ’till like
an old camp meeting song long worn
out, it fails to bring converts, and then
we, like the sow in scripture, ‘ 1 turn to
the wallow again.” This has been the
routine with us for two score years.
Tom Watson, our leader, has with
wisdom and intrepidity blazed the way
for us, and several times has offered as
our champion only to find that the
shouts before the battle were turned
into whines of defeat, because of de- -
sections while the battle was being
fought. Brother farmers, this will
never win. As at the Alamo, the line
must be drawn and those who want
to stay in the fight must step over,
and determine to fight till the war is
over.
It takes money to organize an army,
it takes money to organize or re-or
ganize a political party. Watson has
sacrificed both time and money. Now,
the writer of this would suggest to
him to open a subscription page in the
Jeffersonian showing the sincerity of
those who are continually calling out
for reorganization. I’ll chip in one
dollar as soon as it appears.
