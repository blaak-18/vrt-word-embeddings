Rheumatism
Do you want to get rid
of it? If so, take Dr. Miles
Nervine modified as di
rected in pamphlet around
bottle. In addition to the
direct curative properties
it has a soothing effect up
on the nervous system by
which the rheumatic
pains are controlled, and
rest and sleep assured.
It has made many cures
of this painful disease,
some of them after years
of suffering. If it will
cure others why not you.
If your case is compli
cated, write us for advice,
it costs you nothing and
may save you prolonged
suffering.
“I was so crippled that I could
scarcely walk. After having my shoes
on for an hour or two I could manage
to walk by suffering the pain. Then
I began to have pains all through
my system. My doctor told me I had
an acute attack of inflammatory
rheumatism. I read about Dr. Miles’
Nervine, bought a bottle and I com
menced to get better from the start
and for the past six months have
scarcely any pain, and am able to
walk as well as ever.”

THE DAWN OF THE COTTON
CENTURY.
(Continued from Page Five.)
craft cleared for a foreign port
during the entire twelve months, and
that was a little vessel whose cargo
weighed seven tons. Such is the
fiasco of our foreign trade.
From New Orleans sixty Ameri
can steamships carried the paltry
total of 149,000 tons; while more than
a thousand foreign steamships bore
away 1,981,000 tons. From Pen
sacola 146 foreign vessels cleared, and
not one American. Must America,
possessing a monopoly of the raw
material without which Europe could
not retain its place as an industrial
continent, be besieged by foreign
craft forever 0 ?
The nations of the world must come
to us for cotton as surely as Israel
in the days of ancient famine went to
Egypt for corn.
The 'South is also becoming a
manufacturing country, but from all
of the Gujf ports last year only 326
American steamships cleared, carry
ing but 405,000 tons, and this went
principally to near-by Caribbean and
Mexican ports. The great export
trade of the South —its shipments of
unmanufactured cotton —went in
2,680 foreign steamships bearing
4,861,000 tons.
We have a preferential tariff in our
favor, but not even this advantage
of fifteen per cent, under the customs
charges whic our rivals must pay
gives us the trade. Altogether our
competitors sold to our Asiatic islands
nearly twice the value of cotton goods
that the United States exported to
the United Kingdom and continental
Europe combined.
British commerce leads the world
today, but that supremacy, founded,
as it is, on the sale of cotton goods
throughout the world, is not perma
nent.
Lord Rosebery in a recent speech
said that if the mother country had
retained the American colonies, the
British capital long before this
would have moved across the At
lantic. It is true, as all men know,
that England’s “dominion over palm
and pine” is due to the fact that its
ships carry to the consuming nations
cotton goods spun of America’s raw
material.
During the Civil War, when Eng
land was unable to get its regular
supply of cotton from America, the
mills of the United Kingdom were
compelled to close, and more than
two million people in that country
dependent upon those factories were
reduced to starvation. Parliament
was convened in special session, and
large sums were appropriated and
turned over to societies created by
the nation to look after the needs of
the multitudes of British workingmen
made destitute through inability of
the manufacturers to import cotton
from America.
Ours is the factory age, the era in
which have been produced goods that
are within the reach of the purses
of the multitude, and it dates from
the invention of cotton-spinning
machinery. In truth, the progress of
mankind along material lines started
with the dawn of cotton a hundred
years ago.
Down through the ages and trench
ing on the eighteenth century a
strange belief haunted the minds of
Jeffersonian
men that somewhere in the mysterious
East there grew a plant which yielded
wool. Many writers and travelers
reported that a marvelous shrub grew
on the inland plains of Asia, that
when it flowered r tiny animal in all
ways resembling a lamb stepped
forth, and that the fleece of this
creature was woven by the Hindus
into a fabric infinitely finer than
any garment made of wool. It was
prophesied and widely believed that
if this quadruped could be caught and
bred its fleece would supply the most
delicate garments for mankind; and
in proof of this belief were ex
hibited the occasional rare fabrics
that found their way westward from
Calicut.
Cotton came with the insignia of
a new civilization, and all the con
servative force of England tried to
trample it to the ground. It was not
until nearly the middle of the
eighteenth century that the manu
facture of calico was made lawful.
And only the woof could be cotton
then. The British law insisted that
linen must constitute the warp.
What might have been the history
of the world had England taken
immediate advantage of the power
possessed by cotton affords daring
opportunity for conjecture.
We may smile at the fact that
India, which taught Europe the first
secrets of the cotton-trade, has been
buying its cotton garments from
British miles. The imperial ruler
whom Vasco da Gama visited in his
court little dreamed that Calicut
would some day be importing calico.
Yet the Hindu operative fixing his
loom primitively under tamarine and
mango trees, and finding himself
incapable of competing with the
cargoes of factory-made goods laid
down on the shores of India by
British ships, is less of an impotent
spectacle than the Southern cotton
grower, backed by the genius, tradi
tions, and promise of America, pro
ducing raw material for the world at
starvation prices, and quietly yet
steadily yielding vassalage from
an American grantor to an English
suzerain. Does the future hold pos
sibilities that our great American
country shall be dominated by alien
holders of our cotton-lands? Now
is the time for American statesmen,
American genius, to awaken. The
dawn of the cotton century is here. —
