Some Knotty Dir.ese W etwea Usatms I
Lousville, Dec. 8.-The seossd day of
the convention of the Federation of La

the action of President Gompers la call
ing to the chair immediately after sell n
call Minr Bether Ktis, one of the wom
en delegates from Indiana. She presid
ed over the deliberations for half an

the convention's time. There are differ
epces between the brewery workers and
stationary firemen and stationary en
gineers; carpenters, woodworkers and
box makers; painters and decoratots and
paper hangers; plumbers, gas and steam
fitters and the steam and hot water fit
ters; printers and machinists; miners
and hoisting engineers; garment work
ers and tailors, and a union independent
of both in Chicago and others i
The credential's committee recom
mended the protests against delegates
from the brewery workers and station
ary engineers and firemen be dismissed.
The delegates were seated and the mat
ter referred to the grievance committee.
A vigorous protest'l s been made by
the United Garment Workers against
the seating of delegates from the Ohica
go Federation of Labor for having ad.
mitted custom clothing makers. The
protest resulted in the Chicago federa
tion receiving instructions to throw out
the clothing makers on penalty of being
t'.emselves expelled from the American
l'ederation of Labor.
In order to give the cotpmitteesan op
portunity to complete the work before
them the rules were suspended and an
adjournment taken.
