A Chance.
S. ..rious piece of real estate .se to
he anu tioned off at the exchange in
londe n comprises the freehold of the
island Volcano in the Mediteranean,
with numerous mountains and two live
crater.. The island is one of the
Aeolian group, off the north coast of
"icily, and is five miles long by two
and a half broad. Vines and fig trees
flourish on it. and the opportunity is a
fine one for some rich man who loves
Theocritus and would like to have an
island home all to himself-'"reclining
on the mountain-side, with our flocks
feeding below and the Sicilian sea in
the distance."
A Good Claim.
A Superior. Wis., man is suing a
railroad company for $2500 for the
death of his two children. The house
was on fire,and a railroad train blocked
the street and delayed the fire engines
getting to the house in time to save
the children.
He Ii Right.

for 10 cents a bushel and fattening
hogs with them. lie says that they
are better than corn, and very much

A Grave Announcement.

that Queen Victoria is -'never sick at
sea." That seems very proper for the
ruler of the queen's navee.

There isn't a great deal of funny read.
,e ing in the Blue Book, which tells all
e, about what everybody gets who works
)f for Uncle Sam, be his or her station
o what it may, but there is a little. Per
.s haps it seems funnier than it really is
a on account of its environments, but it
,s does seem a trifle ridiculous to read ki
n a dry-as-dust chronicle of "Where born,
g where appointed from, where employed,
:s salary," the name of Grover Yellow
n Boy."
This distinguished namesake of the
president is drawing wages from Un
cle Sam and has to sign the pay roll
a or did last year at any rate-along with
e another Indian policeman named Gro
e ver Mountain Sheep.
d Political names are not common, but
' they do get on the rolls. Witness,
e Hoke Red Thunder. This Is a direct
bid for sympathy from the great and
good secretary if the interior.
s Most of the first names are Anglo
g Saxon, and they are Wt the true names
y of the Indians as a plug hat upon
b Apollo Belvidere. Dismounts Thrice i
one man's name. That tells a story
of how when a little boy came into the
world, and with the first thin, sharp
t squall he uttered getting the new
found air out of his lungs to get more
in, and so keep up this process by day
and night until the world ended for
him, the father stepped out of the te
pee and he saw a man get off his horse
e thmee times. One wonders what was
l up. Was he thrown off? What was he
about, anyhow? That was what went
into the mind of this man's father. He
wondered at it and so named the chili
Y for the first thing he saw.
But how It cheapens all to tack on
before the name the handle "William."
Henry Look for Horses Is another such
name. So is Ivan Star Comes Out.
Where got he that Ivan? So is James
Clinches and John Crazy Dog. But
what is William Walks Under Ground?
A mole? How came Geoffrye Chips by
his first name? And what eastern man
y will think of chips as anything else
than what an ax would cut from a piece
of wood. Plainsmen will smile a little
at that notion.
Brian Poor Thunder! That tells of a
storm muttering In the west when this
boy was born, and the father thought
the rumble a tame affair. There are
plenty of men named Lightfoot, and
one man calls himself James C. Light
nins.
Some day if they don't all die off
these names once fixed will be as hon
orable as that of the man who once
kept hogs and whose descendants now
are rather proud that their name is
Howard, or Hog-Ward, to get down to
the bones of the thing.-New York

the glands of my neck, and all efforts
of physicians in Washington, D. C.,
Springfield, Ill., and St. Louis failed to
reduce the enlargement. After six
months' constant treatment here, my
physician turged me to submit to a re
moval of the glad. Atthiscritical mo

and layin aside a dep-rooted pej

and now it is entirely gone, thoghblam

Had I only used your S.S.S. long ago,
I would have escaped years of misery
and saved over $7o."
This experience is like that of all who
surer with deepseated blood troubles.
