Dr. PIERCE'S
Golden Medical
DISCOVERY
Cures Ninety-eight per cent. of al.
cases of Consumption, in all, iie
Earlier Stages.
Although by many believed to be incurs.
ble, there is the evidence of hundreds of
living witnesses to the fact that, in all its
earlier stages, consttuption is a curable
disease. Not every case, but a lae per
centage of cases, and we believe. full 95
per centr are cured by Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery, even after the disease
has progressed so far as to induce repeated
bleedings from the lungs, severe linigering
cough with copious expectoration (includ
ing tubercular matter), great loss of flesh
and extreme enlaciatiou and weakness.
Do you doubt that h undreds of such cases
reported to us as cured by " Golden Med
ical Discovery " were genuine cases of that
dread and fatal disease ? You need not take
ourword for it. They have, in nearly every
instance, been so pronounced by the best
and most experienced home physicians,
who have no interest whatever in mlis
representing them, and who were often
strongly prejudiced a,,d advised againist
a trial of "'Golden MLedical Discovery,"
but who have been forced to confess that
it surpasses, in curative power over this
fatal malady, all other medicines with
which they are acquainted. Nasty cod
liver oil atd its filthy "emuulsions" and
mixtures. had been tried in nearly all these
cases and had either utterly failed to bene
fat, or had only seemed to benefit a little for
a short time. Extract of mnalt, whiskey,
and various preparationts of the hypophos
phites had also been faith fully tried in vain.
The photographs of a large number of
those cured of consumption, bronchitis,
li'ngering coughs, asthma, chronic nasal
catarrh and kindred maladies, have been
skillfully reproduced in a book of m60
pages which will be niailed to you, on re
ceipt of address and six cents in stamps.

there is always somethin ruther catch

people. It is a mighty good sign to see
a man that has faced the storms and
trials and troubles and tribulations of
this vain and fleetin world long enough
to catch the snow of winter on his head.
If a man aint of some account to him

ways and I am always more than willin
to let the gray head of some good old
man be a light to my path and a torch
to my wayward and wanderin feet.
Whao Hie Was a Boy.
"When I was a boy" -says Uncle Dan
iel Rutherford, the oldest man in the
settlement, the last time I was over to
his house--'when I was a boy you
didn't hear people talk about hard
times and skceerce money like they do
nowadays. Naturally of course there
was rich folks and poor folks in the
land in them days like there is today,
but it seems to me somehow like they
was more on a general average then
I than what they are now. They didn't
fly so high up and they didn't drap so
I low down. We didn't have nigh so
much fopperies and fineries and high
flyin tomfoolery as you can notice in
this present day and generation. The
rich folks didn't make sich a terrible
big blow and show, and poor folks
didn't whine and pine and fret and
fume around about bad luck and hard
times like they do now.
"Now as to me," the old man went
on, anybody and everybody that knows
anything about the family records of
Daniel Rutherford can tell you that I
come down from a long line of plain,
common stock and poor people. But
when I was a boy-in all my growin
up I never knowed anything about rale
role hard times. And I never heard
much tell of sich things till here of late
years. You don't have to pile up money
till you can call yourself rich in order
Iment to be fixed up comfdrtable and
snug and independent of the settlement
around you and the world in general.
Whilst the Rutherford generation of
people was always plain and poor if
you counted the dollars and cents on
them, yet at the same time I never
heard tell of any livin man by the name
of Rutherford that went around beggin
or stealin or made a landin in the the
Poor House or the Penitentiary. I was
born and brung up poor, and yet still I
have always lived in the midst of plen
ty as it were. My old daddy before meuo
was poor, as the world goes-poor in
regards to cash money. But if there
ever was a day when we didn't have
plenty of somethin to eat and drink,
and plenty of clothes to wear, it was be
yond my recollection, and if we ever
owed a dollar to any man-livin or dead
-I never heard tell of it. Sometimes
no doubts we had to wear plain clothes,
but they was always clean and com
fortable-warm in winter and cool in
the summer-and the sun never went
down on a day at our house when there
want meat in the smokehouse and corn
in the crib, and meal in the barrel and
molasses in the jug, and eggs in the
basket and lard in the gourd. When I
was a boy folks was folks, but times
was way yonder different then from
what they are now."
lHow It Come to Pass.
13But let me tell you, Rufus, how it
has come to pass that times are so dif
ferent with this present day and gen
eration," says Uncle Daniel, as he back
ed his pipe into the tobacco box after a
fresh load of "the weed."
"When I was a boy people that lived
in the country didn't hurry and worry
and stint and starve themselves to
death in the hopes of makin money.
The mainest thing with people in them
days was to make alivin, and they most
generally made it. If a farmer will but
only work and manage so as to make a
livin it is more than probable that he
will make a little money too. BIut it he
makes a livin he don't need no money
exceptin for some little extries, and if
he don't particlar need any money what
would he want with it anyhow? To a
make a livin-to have somethin to eat
and somethin to wear-that is the first <
and mainest pint in the battle of life 1
anyhow and if a man can win that he is
more than probable to run out ahead
of the hounds. I
"When I was a boy every boy wore S
elothes the same as they do now, but 1
people thatdidn'thave plenty of money
to buy their clothes with got them
made at home. They didn't go in debt
knee deep and then waist deep and then I
chin deep in orderment to fly as high I
as anybody else and keep up big ap
pearments. <
"When I was a boy people didn't live
in the country and *draw their rations
In the city like a heap of them do now- I
adays. On every well regulated farm s
there was one of these big old-fashion
ed corn cribs, and naturally of course j
that meant fat horses and cows and (
hoge and chickens That met the grea t
and growin issue of bread and meat.
It meant hog and hominy-plenty to I
keep soul and body together, money or t
no money.
" When 1 was a boy we had biscnits
at our house at least onest a week, and
sometimes every day in the week. but
we first broke up the ground and then
sowed the wheat, and then cut it down,
and then hauled it in, and then thrash- a
ed it out, and then took it to mill and
paid the toll and brought the materials *
for makin dough back home with us.
"When I was a boy if it come to pa. 1
that we needed a new handle for the
ate we didn't go to the store and pay
two bite for a hade. and then go to
the 1taikdNlu4 ul 4 m a'~lP~blekoaw) ma

have money enough to use itore-bought
tobacco and pay for it in spot cash, Ire
p- would pitch in and raise him a patch of
the weed at home, and then use plain
Red Aleek three hundred and sixty-five
days in the year.
"When I was a boy one box of match
es would ran the family six months,
whereas today there is many a farmer
in this country with a yearlin boy run
i nin loose on his place that will burn
I up a box of matches in six days smokin
aelgreets. With so - many pecurious
I people in the land it aint no wonder
e ment to me that you hear so much talk
i about skeerce money and hard times."
Â· To be certainly of course Uncle Dan
i. iel never dreampt that his plain and
d homely words would And their way
d into the public prints. But they sound
s ed to me like so many great big gobs
d of truth and common sense, and I give
'f them out to you as he give them in to
e me. Let them stand for what they are
worth.
S Young Man, Stay South.
d Whereas, the words of trutth and so
bf erness that fell from Uncle Daniel's
I lips that day put me to shinkiu along
another line. There is nothin in par
ticular the matter with the country we
s live in. The mainest fault, young man,
i is not in our stars, but in ourselves.
I And that's what makes me tell you
0 what I do.
1 Stay South. young man, stay South
t Turn not to the right hand nor is te a
6 left. Stick to your bush. Stand by
3 your colors. Stay South. Don't get in
1 the habit of changing your base. It is
a bad habit. It is like so;vin to the
1 wind or buildin on the sand. It is un
certain and risky and dangerous. Settle
up, and then settle down. Have some
ideas and opinions and convictions of
your own, and then honor them and
press them till the cows come home
and the evenin stars sing together.
Pay your way. Stand up to the rack,
fodder or no fodder. P3ay for keeps
And stay South.
What this country wants and what
the time demands is more grown up
men-men of energy and horse sense
and plenty of push and go. Here, as
elsewhere, and in fact, everywhere,
there is profit in all labor. Pull off
your coat and roll up your sleeves and
spit in your hands and take hold true
heartedly. Choose your way and fol
low it to the end. Chalk down you:
line and then come to taw. If you call
yourself a farmer be a farmer from
Farmersville. Meet the issues as they
come. Stand up like a man. Look the
sun in the face. And stay South.
WVhen you come to think about it
right serious and sober, this is a great
country anyway you take it. It always
was. It grows on you. so to say. For
tunes are now wrapped up in its hills
and buried down under the sod and the
daisies. It's .storehouse is the green
earth's mother breast. Take the keys,
young man, gnd git on the ground
floor. Have a finger in the pie. Don't
ride a bubble back to the unknown
and leave the world to wonder why
you were ever born at all. Dig while
you can call it day. Make haste while
the sun shines. Do about diligently.
(;it a waterbury movement on you.
Beat old Eli gettin there. Think and
work and sow and reap. And stay
South.
No matter who you are, or where you
come from, or what you mean to do, or
what you hope to be, young man, stay
South. You can't improve on the
country. There is none other like it.
And in the South there is so much yet
to come-so much good work for the
clear head and the honest heart and
the stout arm and the willin hand to do.
Men are what God and good mothers
and opportunities make them. Blut
there is comfort in the thought that
opportunities come to all men sometime
and somewhere down the line. Every
day brings its troop of opportunities.
Like the ruthless rider of the pale
horse, they go in at the cottage gate
and up to the palace door. They will
come to you. Don't waste them or neg
lect them. Embrace them and snake
the best of them. Watch all the points
and keep up the corners. Weed your
own row. Shoot high if you hit the
moon. And stay South.
iMake haste slowly when it comes to
'playin quits with the old home and the
old country you live in. Let your days
be many and peaceful in the land of
your fathers. It is the Sunny South.
It is the same dear old South. And
there is plenty of room in the old land
yet.
Thank God for the rest where none molest,
And none can make afraid.
Where peace sits down as plenty's guest
Beneath the homestead shade.

KNOWLEDGE
Brings comfort and improvement and
tends to personal enjoyment when
rightly used. The many who live bet
ter than others and enjoy life more, with
less expenditure, by more promptly
adapting the world's best products to
the needs of physical being, will attest
the value to health of the pure liquid
laxative principles embraced in the
remedy, Syrup of Figs.
Its excellence is due to its presenting
in the form most acceptable and pleas
ant to the taste, the refreshing and truly
beneficial properties of a perfect lax
ative; effectually cleansing the system,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
and permanently curing constipation.
It has given satisfaction to millions and
met with the approval of the medical
profession, because it acts on the Kid
nems, Liver and Bowels without weak
enmg them and it is perfectly free from
every objectionable substance.
Syrup of Figs is for sale by all drug
gists in 50c and $1 bottles, but it is man
ufactured by the California Fig Syrup
Co. only, whose name is printed on every
package, also the name, Syrup of Figs,
and being well informed, yo will not
accept any substitute if ofmlmbe
$48 FOR ONLY $2.

To those who D R
subsribe o FAMILY MAGAZINE
We wish to show the great value that will be given for the money expended.
In the first place, the Magazine itself cannot be matched anywhere in the world
for two dollars. If you wish to prove this, compare it with any other as to mat
ter, illustrations, quality of paper, printing, etc. Then, too, it is so designed asa
to interest every member of the family, which makes it really a dozen magazines
in one. Here, then, is the first $2.00 of the 848.00 mentioned above. The next
;3.00 is represented by the exquisite premium for the coming year, De Longpre's
" Roses," which is the most exquisite oil-picture that has ever been published,
and worth nearer $10.00 than 85.00. Then comes a value of $3.00, represented by
giving every lady reader all the patterns she wishes to use during the year, and
in sizes to suit. A novel and important feature, introduced into I)EMOREST'S
MAGAZINE last April, is a Portrait Album giving eight cabinet-size portraits
each month of the world's celebrities, with a biographical sketch of each person.
Each year's collection of ninety-six portraits of distinguished men and women,
when inserted in the Portrait Album which we can furnish, forms a handsome
ornament for the home, as well as a valuable source of information and refer
ence, interesting all members of the family and their friends. The collection
would cost over a hundred dollars if made in any other way, as many of these
photographs are very expensive, neither time nor money being spared in making
the collection. If we count each portrait at the low valuation of only 25 cents it
would make $24.00 worth with your coming year's magazines; and if you are a
new subscriber and wish to commence your collection from' the first we pub
lished, we will send you the fifty-six already issued, and these fifty-six at 95
cents each would make another $14.00. Summing up all the above, you have a
value of $48.00 for only $2.00. The following fifty-six Portraits were published
in the last volume, which new subscribers will be entitled to free. The ninety
six for the coming year will include names as well known as those already given.
