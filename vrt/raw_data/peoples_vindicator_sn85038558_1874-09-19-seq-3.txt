The First Fire.
New Orleans, Sept. 14.--The peo
ple scene to have responded with alac- ca
city to the advice given them by Dr. as
B]ard, one of the speakers at the TI
Canal street meeting. By 3 p. m. sa
armed men were stationed at the in- G
tersection of all the streets, from the ca
river to Claiborne street. About 4
o'clock. p. in. a body of Metropoli- Cc
tans, about five hundred, with cav- IV
hlry and artillery, appeared at the SI
head of Canal Longstreet commanding el
them, accompanied by an orderly, Cl
then rode up and down Canal street wz
ordering the armed citizens to dis- ra
perse. Son.e desultory firing soon af- re
ter occurred along Canal street, and B1
some few casualties are reported on ta
both sides. The Metropolitans are or
reported to have broken at the first ar
tire. The citizens captured one piece H
of their artillery. The citizens are T;
now building a barricade along Poy- w
lras street, having already captured hi
the City Hall and taken possession of
the fire alarm telegraph. The police
telegraph line are worked by a bat
tery from thie City Hall and have been P
detatched therefrom, rendering them i
useless. There is one company of
United States troops here, but they H
remain in the Custom House quiet '
spectators of the lively scene being
enacted in front of them. The State T
authorities seem to have great con a
tidence in their ability to deal with o'
what they term an armed mob and say
unless the people disperse there will
be bloody work to-night.
GOV. PENN'S PROCLAMATION.
I'roclamation to the People of Louisiana .:
For two years you have borne with
pati'ence amd fortitude a great wrong
through fraud and violence ; the gov
etnrurnnt of your choice has been over- ci
thrownl anld its po~wer usurped ; protest g9
after protest, appeal after appeal to the ti
President of the United States and to G
Coingress have tfailed to give you the re- n
lief you had a right, under the constitu- a
tion, to demand. The wrong has not
been repaired. On the contrary, through
the instunmentality of partisan Judges,
you are debarred front all legal rkmedy,
and lay by (lday taxation has been in
creasring with cost and penalties amount- It
ing to confiscation of your property. d
Your substance squandered. your credit tl
ruined, resulting in failure and barkrupt- A
cy of your most valued institutions. The ro
right of suffrage is virtually taken from i
you by the enactment of skillfully de
vised reistration and election laws. The
judiCialbTranch of your .government has a
been stricken down by the conversion of
the legalposseo comitatus of the sheriffto g
the use of the usurper for the purpose of a:
defeating thie decrees of the courts, his ti
defia:nce of law leading him to use this v
very force for the arrest ofthe sheriff q
hinmself, while eniageld in the execution |
of the process of the court. To these
calamities may be added a corrupt and
vicious legislature, concocting laws in vi
olation of the constitution forthe pur
pose of guarding and perpetuating their
isrlrped authority; a metropolitanpolice,
piaid by the eity under the control of the
usurper, quartered npon you to overcome
and keep yoit iu subjection. Every pub
lic right has been deied you and as if
to goad you to desperation, private armnns
are seized and individuals arrested, and
to such extremities are yen driven that
manhood revolts at further Submission.
Constrained from a sense of duty as ,he

lpon the militia ofthe State, embracing i
all persons between the ages of eighteen i

The streets above Canal street are
well filled with armed citisenas. The
impression pow prevails that no faur
ther attempt will be made by the
Metropolitans to disperse their oppo
nents who handled them so roughly
this afternoon. The.city isremarka
bly quiet throughout, and no further
comnict is apprehended before morn
ing.. M3ost of the barricades are ma:de t
with street railroad cars. Six or
eight citizens and twenty or thirty
Mletropolitans were killed in the fight
this evening, and many wounded on b1
both sides. me
Barricades are errected on all the th
streets between Poydras and Canal, al
and the people's party hold all that I
jiortion of the city above Canal. The in
(letropolitans are massed in and in
around Jackson Square and the St. ,i
Louis l[otel. tl
There was quite a sharp fight at the tL
river end of Canal street about 4 U
o'clock. in
The colored men, of which the
Metropolitan brigade was largely al
composed, broke and ran11 upon the tl
first lire, leaving thir white coma
rades, a number of whom were killed
and wounded. W

Platform of the White People's
Party.
We, the white people of Louisiana, em
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con
servative Pairty, the White Man's larty,
the Liberal Party, the Reform Party and
all others opposed to the Kellogg usur
pati do so l ly solenly resolve and declare :
1. That the governuett now existing
in Louisiana originated in, astd has been
maintained by force and fraud, in oppo
sition to the will of a large nomajority of
the voters of the State; in oppositjon to
thei priinciples of the Constitution of the,
United States and in violation of every
principle of justice and liberty.
2 That the dominant faction of the
Radlical party in this State has, by false
and fracedulent representations, inlhntmed
the passions .and prejIldices of the ne
groes, as a race, against the whites, and
lhas thereby made it necessary for tile
white people to unite and act together in
self-defense and the preservation of white
civilization.
3. That the rights of all non cinder the
Constitution and laws of the laud must
be respected and preserved inviolate, ir
respective of race, color or previous con
dition, but we deny that Congress can
Constitutioum:lly enact laws to force the
two races into soeial union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have nio desire to deprive the colored
people of any rights to which they are en
titled, but we are conviinced that the re
forms ilnperatively demanded, can be
eftected only by electing to ottice white
imen of known capacity and integrity,
andl we believe that large numbers of
colored citizens will vote with us to se
cure a goveinnieiht which must be bene
ficial alike to both races. c
5. That we disclaim earnestly any in
tention of carrying, or attemptiug to car- c
ry, the approaching election by violence,
and that charges to this effect emanating
fron our Radi:al enemies, are without
foundation and are falsely made for the
purpose of obtaining the aid of the mil
itary firce of the Uhited States in order
to over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existing, unsurpation and subvert the true
princi ples of the government.
6. That W. 1'. Kellogg is amnere usurp
er and we denounce him as such, that his
government is arbitrary, unjust and op
pressive; and that it can maintain it
self only through Federal intertference.
7. That the election and registration
laws under wbich this election is being
conducted aver intended to perpetuate
the usurpation by depriving the people
and especially our natrralized citizens of
an opportunity to register and vote, but
we announce, distinctly, that it is the
determination of the people to have a
fair and free election anud to see that the
result is not changed by fraud or violence.
8. That we extend to all our race inl
every clinme the right hand of fellowship
and a cordial invitation to come and set
tle among us, and unite their destinies
with ours.
9. That while we are in favor of meet
ing punctually the payment of the legit
imate debt of Louisiana, we are immno
vably opposed to the recognitions issued
in the name of the State, and we pledge
ourselves to make a searching investiga
tion in the matter.
We advise our people to vote against
the amendments to the Constitution pro
posed by the usurping Legislature and
pledge ourselves on the restoration of the
.overnitent to honest hands, to provide
for the payment of all honest indebted
ness of the State.
THE DUTY OV SUI'ERVISORR.--The
Democratic and Conservative Super
visors of Registration have important
functions to perform.
1. They must be present at the
opening and closing of the otffice, and
be certain to check off the last regist
ered voter, so) as to prevent any ad
dition in the pight time.
2. They must keep a list of all the
registered voters as fast as they. are
being registered on thile books, and
this list must mention: 1st, the name,
2d, the age, 34, the color, 4th, the
residence, including name of street
and number of house.
3. As soon as they qualify and en
ter the office, they must make out a
list of all those previously registered,
as above stated.
4. When a voter is refused registra
Stion his name and residence must be
taken down.
The above should be snbmitted
every day to the Parish Committee,
to be used to ferret out any frands
committed.

TIHE SALES of the SINGER last year
was the greatest ever attaineA for
any Sewing Machine in a year, and was
nearly double the sides of its highest
competitor, as may be seen by reference
to the account of sales for 1873, from
sworn returns made to the owners of the
Sewing Machine Patents-from which
statistics we select the five leading ma
chines, viz:
The Singer sold 232,444
" Wheeler & Wilson, " 119,190
" Domestic, " 40,114
" Grover & Baker, " 36,176
" Weed, " 21,769
It will be observed that the difference
in favor of the SINGER, is the enormous
amount of 113,254 over the highest com
petitor. This result has been obtained
after years of competition.
We submit to an interested public if it
is claiming too much to say-the Singter
is the most popular Sewing Machine in
the world.

The Saturday Evenipg Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub- T'
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY N
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblLenIished reputation
for the unsurpassed purity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
It is ipro-eminently
The Best Family Paper S
that is published in this country, from its '1
never containing anything that would
otlend the feelings of any one, either in z
a religious or political sense, or that li
could ndt be read at any fireside without ti
objection fromt the most fastidious. o
Tihe circulation of the Saturday Even- d
ing Post, through not quite so large o
.perhaps, as its younger contenporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLI) AND SUBSTANr'IAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
iper itself. and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &.e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our E
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted S
ability and. known reputation. 1
By increasing its thurmer attractions,
and adding mIany judicious and pleas- r
ing novelties, by studying how to pileaso
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlahrged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issue, and
continue to maintain the claim of the
' Saturday Evening Post to its title of TuIr
OLDEST AMD THlE lEST of Family Story
r Papers.
