Ayer's
Hair Vigor
For restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once agreea
ble, healthy,
and effectual
for preserv
ing the hair.
It soo8001n re
stores .fuded
- or gray hair
to it.s original
color, with the gloss and fresh ness of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, fall
ing hair checked, and baldness often,
though not always, cured by its
use. Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the Lair with a pasty sediment, it
wif keep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or fadllng off,
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff, which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from those deletericus sub
stances which make some plrepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted imeryely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing clse
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it ,'"ich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.

Ayer's Cathartic Pills,
For the relief
and cure of all
derangements in
the stomach, liv.
or, and bowels.
They are a. mild
aperient, and an
excellent purga.
tive. Being pure.
1 ly vegetable, they
contain no mer.
cury or mineral
whatever. Much
serious sickness and suffering is prevented by
their timely use; and every family should
have them on hand for their prote'tion and
reli;f when required. Long experience has
proved them to he the safest, surest, and
best of all the Pills with which the market
abounds. Bl their occasional use,tihe blood
is puritled, the corruptions of the system ex
pelled, obstructions removed, and the whole
machinery of life restored to its healthy activ
ity. Internal organs which become clogged
and sluggish are eleansed by Ayer's Pills,
and stimulated into action. Thus incipient
disease is changed into health, the value of
which change, when reckoned on the vast
multitudes who enjoy it, can hardly be com
puted. Their sugar-coating makes them
pleasant to take, and preserves their virtues
unimpaired for any length of time, so4hat
they are ever fresh, and perfectly reliable.
Although searching, they are mild, and oper
ate without disturbance to the constitution or
diet or occupation.
Full directions ire given on the wrapper to
each box, how to use them as a Family 'Physic,

VINEGAR BITTERS the most wonder
ful Invigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit.
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
ganus wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In.
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, n'JT nessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
coimpauied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to D)It. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
IIi'rrnrts, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the dligestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its, fluids with
VINEO AR I TrERS. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus tire-armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, Head
ache, Pain in the Shoulders. Coughs,
Tightness of the Chest, aizziness, Sour
Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste
in the Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of the Heart, Inflammation of the
Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the ollfprings of Dyspepsia. One bot
tle will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrofula, or King's Evil, White
Swellings. Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled
Neck, Goitre, Scrofulous Inflamnations,
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WALKER'S VIN
EGA RBITT'ERa have shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.-Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of WA..LR'S

For Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt-Rhemn, Blotches, Spots, Pim

worms; Scald-head, Sore Eyes, Erysip~
nas, Itch, Scurfs, ])iseqlorations of the
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skinsdf
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of thes Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou.
sands, are eflietually destroyed and re
mnoved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelminitics will free the
srstem from worms like these Bitters.
ForFemlale Complalnts, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanae it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
