BILL HOWARD WAS KEEPING
THE NEGRO, RUCKER, IN
OFFICE.
Dear Sir:—Tn reference to the con
troversy between yourself and Con
gressman Howard regarding the ne
gro, Rucker, I think the real facts
ought to be made public. Almost
every business man in the State of
Georgia is thrown in contact, in some
way, with the Collector of the Inter
nal Revenue, and it is a shame that
this negro has been retained in office.
Even though this negro may have
made a good officer, yet it w r ould have
been possible to oust him if he had
no backing, but it has simply been
impossible to do anything on account
of the support the negro has had
back of him. Here are the facts, and
the people can draw their own con
clusions.
During William McKinley’s second
term, the writer was an applicant for
appointment to succeed this negro,
Rucker. I had the support of Senator
Clay, Congressmen Livingston, Adam
son and Griggs, and I know these
gentlemen did everything in their
power to get that negro out. I wrote
Congressman Howard that if he
would give me his support I would
see that his father-in-law, Dr. King,
was retained and had a good job.
CONGRESSMAN HOWARD RE
PLIED TO ME THAT “A BIRD IN
HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE
BUSH, AND AVE ARE GOING TO
IET IT STAND AS IT IS.”
The people of Georgia have al
ways condemned the Republicans for
placing negroes in office, but 1 think
one of our number who will howl
against the appointment of negroes,
and then secretly hold these negroes
in office, is numbered among that
class of whom the Savior said, “How
shall ye escape the damnation of
hell,” and of whom I say, how shall
they escape the condemnation of the
people?
The people of Georgia have been
forced to bow to this negro Rucker
all these years for no other reason
than just simply to furnish a job to
one of his white clerks.
Yours truly,
Atlanta, Ga. J. K- McCALL.
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AMERI
CAN “FOREIGN MISSION”
MONEY.
Dear Sir: —Will you please give us,
as near as possible, the total amount
expended yearly by the United States
for Foreign Missions? Also the near
est attainable number of people in
the united States who are not Chris
tians, or the number of people who
belong to no branch of the Church?
Will you also give, as best you
can, an estimate of the number who
are really in need of help—food, rai
ment, or medical attention?
Thanking you in advance, I beg to
remain, Your friend,
Avera, Ga. T. J. H.
Answer.
(1) The total amount expended by
the United States for foreign mis
sions is $16,000,000.00.
(2) The total number of people
who do not belong to any church,
and who do not profess religion, is
60,000,000. About one-third only of
the population of this country pre
tends to be Christians, and T cannot
understand why it is that our foreign
missionaries do not convert more
than one-third of their own fellow
countrymen before breaking their
necks about the Chinese, the Japs,
the Koreans, and the Hindoos.
(3) The actual poverty of this
country is something which cannot be
demonstrated to a mathematical cer
tainty. In 1 838, the great scholar
and statesman, Hugh S. Legare, said,
during the course of a speech in Con
gress, that “we (meaning the people
of the United States) “have no poor,
and it will be a long time before we
have any such problem on our
hands.” Nobody disputed the state
ment, and I think, as a historical
fact, it could have been said up to the
time of the Civil War that we had no
poor. Such a thing as people starv
ing to death, or committing suicide
as an escape from starvation, was ac
tually unheard of, except in acci
dental cases, isolated and remote
from human help.
At the present time, the number
of the unemployed, of the poor and of
the hungry must range somewhere
between a million and ten million
human beings. It is said that there
are tens of thousands of children of
such cities as New York, Philadel
phia, Boston, and Chicago, who go
hungry to school, are insufficiently
clothed, and are diseased- In China,
a regular part of the equipment of a
missionary church is a free drug
store, (which they call a “dispen
sary”,) a surgeon, a doctor, and some
trained nurses. If these medical and
surgical people are not fully occupied
by sufferers who come to them for
relief, they go out in the highways
and byways in China, searching for
those who need medical and surgical
treatment, and who need scientific
nursing.
The point that I have been making
on Foreign Missions is that we have
departed from the command of Christ,
and the practice of the first 1800
years after Christ. We no longer
rely on the simple gospel plan of
teaching the heathen that which
Christ and His disciples. We now
rely upon free medicines, free doc
tors, free literary schools, the sup
port of orphans, widows and lepers;
the teaching of up-to-date farming;
the teaching of music, sewing, em
broidery and cooking; we rely upon
the pleasure that we give to the
heathen when one of the missionary
dentists cleans out his nasty mouth,
and puts a new set of teeth in it, or
fills with gold the half-decayed fangs
that may remain in his gums.
Our folks have, apparently, lost
their heads on this subject; and the
Christian Index was so forgetful of
cause and effect that it published
prominently a letter written to the
paper from China by Rev. Dr. W.
T. Ayres, who defended the luxu
rious living of the Foreign Mission
aries in China, by saying that if they
did not live in that style, keeping at
least three servants, the Chinese
would not respect them. How dif
ferent is that from the meek and
lowly Jesus, Who was despised of
men because He consorted with the
poor and lived like one of them!
How different it is from the pioneers
of the Christian faith, who won the
confidence of the common people,
among whom they spread the gospel
by contrasting their own unselfish,
consecrated poverty with the pride
and the arrogance of the pagan
priesthood’ T. E. W.

THE INTOLERANCE AND PEEV
ISHNESS OF THE REVEREND
WESLEY LANE.
Dear Sir: —As an evidence of the
intolerance of the ministers of the
gospel today and also how you are
either misunderstood or misrepre
sented, I wish to quote to you a
statement made here last Sunday by
Rev. Wesley Lane, a Methodist
preacher. In speaking to the Wo
man’s Foreign Missionary Society on
the work of missions in the foreign
field, he said, in substance:
“I do not endorse everything
‘Dear Dr. Lovett’ does. I think that
he made a very great mistake in
ever noticing the Hon. Thos. E.
Watson at all; for if he hadn’t,
nine-tenths of the people would
never have heard of his views at all.
Christ said, ‘Go ye into all the world
and preach the gospel to every crea
ture, —now will you believe Christ,
or will you believe Tom Watson? I
say to you, put Tom Watson and
what he says to one side and go for
ward to do what Christ commands.”
I just thought I would write you
this for your amusement, although I
know you hear such things every
day- Yours truly,
Wrens, Ga. H. L. FRAIN.
Comment.
Let us all be patient and forbear
ing with such intolerant men as the
Reverend Wesley Lane. The pulpit
will hear from the pew before a
great while longer; and the pulpit
will do a wise act in heeding the
pew.
There isn’t a particle of conflict
between what Christ said we ought
to do and what I am reverently ad
vocating. “Go ye into all the world
and preach the Gospel to every crea
ture”, does not mean that such faith
ful men as the Reverend Wesley
Lane should pull his congregations
for money to support Christian mis
sionaries in such luxury that none of
them have less than three servants
to wait on them in their elegant
homes. The Reverend W. T. Ayers
gave the whole thing away in the
Christian Index four weeks ago. In
defending the fine living and the em
ployment of so many srevants by the
foreign missionaries, he argued that
unless the foreign missionaries lived
in that style and employed at least
three servants, the people of China
would not respect them.
How does the Reverend Wesley
Lane reconcile that kind of luxu
rious living, and catering to the
standards of the Chinese empire, to
the style of living which was that of
Christ, and which caused Him to be
despised of men? He went around
among the poor, barefooted and
bareheaded, with one garment on,

eating with the lowly, sleeping
among the poor, and He was scorned
for it. But the modem missionary,
actually writes home from China that
he is obliged to live as he does, ele
gantly and sumptuously, served
every day by three servants, or he
would not be respected by the
Chinese.
How many servants does the
Reverend Wesley Lane employ to as
sist his wife and daughters in the
doing of their domestic work? How
long will it be before the scales drop
from his eyes, and he realizes how
unnatural and unscriptural it is to
tax the poor country congregations
of Georgia to furnish magnificent
winter homes and summer homes
and house boats and servants for
foreign missionaries, who are living
up to the standards of the wealthy
people of China? T. E. W
