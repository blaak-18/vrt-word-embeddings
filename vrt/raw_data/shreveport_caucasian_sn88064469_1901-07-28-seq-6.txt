PRECEPT IN SCHLEY CASE
Takes In All Acts of the Admiral Dur
Ing the Spanish War.
Washington, July 2 .-The precept
to the Schley court of inquiry has been
given to the public. It is addressed to
Admiral Dewey, as president of the
court, instructing him concerning the
matters to be investigated. While it
directs that the "entire matter" of Ad
miral Schley's conduct during the oper
ations in West Indifln waters shall be
investigated, it also selects certain acts
of Schley ccncerning the facts and pro
priety of which it calls for particular
investigation. These points cover brief
ly Admiral Schley's alleged delay with
the flying squadron at Cienfuegos; the
slowness of his progress toward Santia
go after leaving Cienfuegos; the retro
gade movement toward Key West; the
effectiveness of the bombardness of the
Spanish fleet and the ranges used in
the reconnoissance of May 31; the state
of the coal supply on various ships when
he telegraphed the department that he
would return to Key West; the loop of
the Brooklyn at Santiago and the accu
racy of his reports and matters relating
to the controversy between him and
Commander Hodgson, over the alleged
colloquy which is said to have taken
place aboard the Brooklyn, when the
loop was made during the naval en
gagement off Santiago.
With the exception of the last two
counts the others practically sum up the
criticisms of Admiral Schley's conduct
made by Secretary Long to the senate,
which the secretary characterized as
Schley's "reprehensible conduct." One
of the important points in the precept is
the direction to the court to report in its
conclusions "all the pertinent facts
which it may deem to be established to
gether with its opinion and recommen
dations in the premiacs."
The court will probably sit for several
months, more than likely until after
congress convenes in December.
Judge Lemly has not yet decided who
the witnesses before the court shall be.
They may be taken from the navy,from
the army or from clvil life, for undoubt
edly some of the newspaper correspond
eats will be called in the case. It is
even probable in view of the recent in
terview of Oaptain Euls of the Spanish
navy, that Le and Admirul Oervera him'
self will be called if Admiral Sohley de- I
sires it
Lemley Appeat"ed .d Ae**pts.
Washington, July f7.-Seoretary Long
has announced that he has selectes
Captain Sam O. Lemley, the law offie
of the navy department, to be judgi
advocate of the Sohley court of inquiry
Captain Lemley has accepted.
Secretary Long has not heard from
Rear Admiral Kimberley, who is re
ported to have seat a lesser to him ex
plaining that the state of his health
would hardly permit him to aot as e
member of the Aourt.
