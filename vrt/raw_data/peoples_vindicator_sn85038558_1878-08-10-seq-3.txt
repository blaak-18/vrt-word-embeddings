d Overtasking the Energie$
It is not advisable for any of us to
overtask our energies, corporeal or mental
but in the eager pursuit of wealth or fame
or knowledge. bow many transgress this
salutary rule. It must be a matter of -
greaHI importance to all who do so to
know how to regain the vigor so reckless
ly expended. The remedy is neither cost
ly or difficult to obtain. Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters is procurable in every
city, town and settlement in America. and
it compensates for a drain of bodily or
mental energy more eflfctually than any
idvigorant ever prescribed or advertised.
Laboring men, athlete, students, journal
ists, lawyers, clergymen, physicians, all
bear testimony to its wonderously reno
vating powers. It increases the capabil
ities for undergoint fatigue, and counter
acts the ijurious .effects upon the system
s of exposure, sedentary habits, unhealthy
1or wearying avocations, or an insalubri
ous climate, and is a prime alterative, di
uretic and blood depurent.

The following letter, addressed to
Mayor Pilabury, contains a suggestion a
which may be found serviceable .at
this time :
WASHINGTON, D. C., July 30, 78.
To the Honorable Mayor of New Orleans:
Dear Sir-I send you the incloned
preecription, which 1 believe will pre
vent an attack of yellow fever. What
is its rationale ? The cause of yellow
fever is of vegetable origin-an infn
itesmal poisonous vegetable in the air,
and which, inhaled, is taken into the
ejaisculation, and from its growth in thi
blood causes the disease; then to
prevent or cure must be by an agent
introduced into the circulation, which
will destrol the vegetable life. Sal
phor will "destroy both animal nad
Svegetable li. O this theory the
sulphide of sods was given to prevent
malarial attacks, and with eminent
success. .To preparation of sllpeur
