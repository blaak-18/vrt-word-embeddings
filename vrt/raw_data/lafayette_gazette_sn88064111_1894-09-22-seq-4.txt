Has discovered in one of our common
 rpasture weeds a remedy that cures every
`i-iklnd of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of Its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston. Send postal card for book.
A benefit is always experienced from the
first bottle, and a perfect cure is warranted
when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains, like needles passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts be
ing stopped, and always disappears In a
week after taking it. Read the label.
If the stomach is foul or bilious it wlb
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can~get, and enough of- it.

time. Sold by aEDruggists.

Obedlence to the Letter.
1 A story is told in central Maine of a
young woman who distanced pater
familias, so to speak, in a matter of
parental authority: "Now, Mary
Jane," said the stern parent, "I will
consent to your going to the dance at
the Corner to-night only under one
condition." "What is that?" asked
Mary Jane, meekly, her eyelids droop
ing pathetically. "It is," said the
father, "that you won't let that young
scapegrace, - , bring you home."
"I'll promise," said the maid, and she
went to the dance.
Scene next morning: "I thought you
promised me not to let that fellow
bring you home?" said the angry par
ent, with fire flashing from his eyes.
"'He didn't bring me home," said Mary
Jane, archly. "Buthe came home with
you, for I saw him." "Yes. but he
didn't bring me. I :told him what I had
promised, so we walked home and he
led the horse."-Lewiston Journal.

Stractor, at 76 Moran street just.or Gratoit
Mr Elsey is an old resident of Detroit
having moved here about forty years ago.
He has erected hundreds of houses in differ

to such buildings as the Newberry & Mo I

"I have been Detroit grow from a village
to a city," he observed yesterday in conver
sation with the writer, "andl.I don't think
there are many towns in America to.day
equal to it in point of beauty. I know al.
most everybody in the city, and an .ineident
which recently happened in my life has in.
terested all my friends.
"It is now about eight years ago since 1
was stricken dowrn with my first case of
illness. One cold, blustering day I was
down town and through my natural careless.
ness at that time I permitted myself to get
chilled right through. W~hen I arrived home
that evening I felt a serious pain in my left n
leg. I bathed it that night, but by morning I
I found it had grown worse. In fact, it was
so serious that I sent for my family physi i
clan, and he informed me that I was suffer.
Sng from varicose veins. My leg swelled
up to double its natural size and the pain in
creased in volume. The agony was simply
awful. I was laid up and never left my bed
foreight weeks. At times I felt as thougi t
I would grow frantic with pain. My leg t
was bandaged and was propped up in the c
bed at an angle of 80 degrees in order tc
keep the blood from flowing to my extremi
ties.
"I had several doctors attending me, but i
1 believe my own judgmenthelped me- better
than theirs. After a siege of two months ]
could move around, still I was on the sidc I
list and had to doctor myself for years. 3 c
was never really cured and suffered any e
amount of anguish.
"About two years ago I noticed an article
In the Eoeding _enws about my friend, Mr.
Northrup, the Woodward Avenue merchant. e
In an interview with him he stated that he
had used Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale .1
People and that they cured him. I knew -Ã½
him very well, having built his house oul I
on Woodward Ave., and I thought I would
follow his suggestion. I must confess I did
so with marvelous success. From the time a
I began to take the Pink Pills I felt mysell
growing to be a new man. They acted or
me like a magical stimulant. The pain do o
parted and I soon was as strong and healthy I
as ever. Before trying the Pink Pills I had
used any amount of other medicine without t
any noticeable benefit. But the Pills cured
me and I was myself again.
"When a person finds himself relieved e
end enjoying health he isapt to expose him. b
self again to another attack of illness. Some a
three months ago I stopped taking the PinI
Pills, and from the day I did so I noticed a
change in my condition. A short time since a
I renewed my habit of taking them with the e
same beneficial results which met me for. t
merly. I am again nearly as strong as ever
although I am aman about .5 years of age. J
tell you, sir, the Pink Pills are a most won-.
derful medicine, and if they do as well in h
other casesas they did in mine they are the u
best in the world. I freely recommend them
to any sufferer." a
