New Orcoans, April 1.-The car:;
Ing away of additional cribbing at the
Ilyymela crevasse early londay morn
ing brought the forces that have been
at work there to the verg&e of aband
onment of the attempt to close the
break. Later in the day, however, as
a result of several conferencu,, it was
agreed to continue the undertaking,
though all hands are likely to be call
ed off in the terrific current washes
out the new lines of cribbing which
were started from both ends of the
levee late Monday afternoon. In no
event can the work be completed in
side of a week, unless ample money Is
guaranteed the next disaster to the
cribbing is likely to mark the end of
the struggle. The levee board let It
be known that it was at the end of Its
resources, and that unless the planters
and the railroads could assure sub
scrilptions amounting to $50,000 it
would be compelled to throw up its
hands. Doubtless doubhe that amount
will be required to complete the job.
By evening it was said the break was
close to 700 feet in width with the ends
still steadily melting away.
Two ridges between which the levee
caved has prevented the water from
spreading rapidly above and below, but
the mighty torrent is filling the lakes
and bayous to the rear and in the next
fortnight the whole basin from the
La Fourche to the lower limits of cul
tivatable land in Plaquemine is likely
to go under water, causing inestimable
damage and much suffering.
The Texas and Pacific road is now
hopelessly Involved, with water run
ning deep over the tracks and with
little hope of an early resumption of
traffic If the crevasse is permitted, to
run until low water comes. The South
ern Pacific people however claim that
there service is not likely to be In
terrupted owing to the heighth and
solidity of their road and the fact that
it is freely studded with culverts for
the escape of flood water. The Howell
crevasse, however, is absolutely be
yond control, and this has suspended
all traffic over the Napoleonville
branch of the Southern Pacific. the at
tempt to crib the roadbed having been
abandaned.
General Booth's Hearty Welcome.
London, April 1.-London accord
ed General William oBoth, commander
in chief of the Salvation Army, a great
welcome home at Albert Hall Monday
night. The immense auditorium was
packed from the floor to the roof.
There was not a vacant seat in the
building which has a capacity of 9600
persons and in spite of the rainy night
hundreds were turned away from the
door. General Booth's appearance on
the platform was the signal for a re
markable demonstration.
Farmers Fight a Duel.
Lake Charles, La., April 1.-John
Guillory and James McMillian, farm

close to the east line ,of the parish.
The men quarreled about a dog, ac

'They met ifs the road. Guillory said:
"We will settle our troubles right
now," and both pulled guns. McMil

instantly. McMillian surrendered to

Lincus in plain colors are sure to be
worn inter on. especially in champagne
and in reseda tones, as well as the
riverside' suitings. closely allied to
crash, and hollands and drill. Linen
shot with white and mercerized cottons
and linens are preparing in large quan
fities for summer and so are the incr
cerized fancy coatings with line checks,
revived from twenty years ago.
Linen canvas in self colors is siligu
l:nly elegant, and piques. plain a
fancy, and spotted duck are suin:ar
favorite.. There are striped sui in.s
and' fancy cottons Navin- tl110 &Fll" '

hl eoeed. eipecially in the brilliintes for
blouses a-il children's, frocks. amid a
mixture of silk and linen with tiny lit
tle motifs in relief.
Sheer lawn can be strongly recon
mended for evening blouses in ail col
ors, and the embroidered grass lawns
make pretty evening as well as day
gowns. There are some new applique
spots which are quite wonderful-black
on light green and other colors. They
are applied to linens and would he cap
ital for seaside wear.
Irish linen is heavy and durable and
affords a good choice. Printed dri!ls
and twills will be worn and all kinds
of sateens.
The zephyrs are very cheap. but they
are not so much in demand as they
were a few years ago. or the galateas.
though there are some tempting steep
herds' plaids lightly shaded.
A new material is the sole del:aino.
which looks like wool and silk, but is
really all cotton. Some of the patterns
are like the old English wall papers-
in continuous circles formed of tiny
flowers tied with ribbon bows and ii:
closing more flowers. When these are
mercerized, they are extremely attrac
tive.
All kinds of pastoral designs. some
with pretty little rakes and hoes tied
with ribbon, are curious and pretty.
and one pattern looks like bobbdnet.
There are full, rich floral designs on all
these, some covering the entire j attern.
some appearing between stripes, tiny
little bunches of violets peeping out be
tween checks.
In June no doubt there will be plenty
of grass lawns seen, for this year they
will show silk stripes and white em
broidery between and pretty chine
stripes with silk lines on either side.
Among the most delightful features
of the summer stuffs are all the chine
effects introduced into everything and
the pretty bunches of misty flowers
and multicolored flowers so suggestive
of the happiest days of Watteau and
Boucher. %
The new line canvas displays fancy
stripings like drawn thread work, with
an interthreading of green silk here
and there, and in the gras lawns these
lacelike stripes assert themselves as
well as borderings, the simpler the bet
ter
Voile is a material which is very pret
ty with lace insertion stripes.

the devotees of fashion, and the somber
robes are put away and apparel of rain
bow tint donned for spring.
Among the things prepared for this
joyous event is an Easter confection,
here represented. for which its design
er claims that it shows a little, at leaet,
what the costume of the immediate
future is likely to be. The bodice Is
not much pouched. the front being bor
dered with galloon, which is carried
round the well shaped and uncommon
cape. It is wade of the new coarse
canvas of a silver gray hue. Both
skirt and bodice are plaited, these
plaits being held down by insertions
with braid. At the foot the fullness is
allowed to flow. The sleeves are of the
bishop order. Over this can be worn
one of the new smart little cape wraps
which are lined with silk. The cape is
so shaped that it has much the appear
ance of a sack coat, fitting the shoul
ders well and then falling freely, simu
lating the .Iapanes.' kimono in the
sleeve. This is altogether an Ideal cos
tune.
Of the smart violet hats shown in the
second cut one is a close fitting. be
coming affair in burnt straw with an
edging of black straw round the brim
and trimming of violets, foliage and
cream lace. 't'he second is a new shape
in black chip. with an upturned curved
brim. the edge of which Is white chip.
