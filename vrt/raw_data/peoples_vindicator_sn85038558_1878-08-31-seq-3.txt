Overtasking the Energies.
It is not advisable for any of us to
overtask our energies, corporeal or mental
f but in the eager pursuit of wealth or fame
f or knowledge. how many transgress this
salutary rule. It must be a matter of
great importance to all who do so to
know how to regain the vigor so reckless
ly expended. The remedy is neither cost
ly or difficult to obtain. Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters is procurable in every
city, town and settlement in America, and
it compensates for a drain of bodily or
mental energy more effectually than any
invigorant ever prescribed or advertised. 1
Laboring men, athlete, students, journal
ists, lawyers, clergymen, physicians, all
bear testimony to its wonderously reno- 1
vating powers. It increases the capabil
ities for undergoing fatigue, and counter- I
acts the injurious effects upon the system
of exposure, sedentary habits, unhealthy I
or wearying avocations, or an insalubri- I
ous climate, and is a prime alterative, di- s
uretic and blood depurent.
Items of Interest,
