no Deserved Honers.
the It was known Tuesday last, that Mr.
Est- Branch King, of New Orleans, one of the
are Jurors in the celebrated case of the
do United Sitates vs. citizens of Natchito.
InI- ches, which createdl such wide spread in
lid terest throughout the country, would ar
'ag rive in our city on Wednesday evening. I
The Brass Band imnmediately determined
be to honor him with a comoplimentary
nrd sere;tule. Mr. Kitng reached our city
of about 8 I. in., Wednesday The Band
ny immediately repaired to Mrs. Garzia's
is, boarding house, where the gentleman was
ian stopping and completely surprised him.
tie A very large number of prominent citi
are zees were present and when Mr. King
ry made his appearance he was rmost heart.
Mg ily and cordially greeted. Declaiming
any idea of making an address he i In
ad vited his friends to refreshments at the
nd Plmeuin. Here RoIn. M..J. Cunningham ý
,e. was called upon and after some appro
SW printed remarks, gave as a toast "The
it- trial by Jury which protects the rights
re. of the citizen against the oppression of
re the government." After the Band had
n. played several airsJudge D. Pierson was
he voiciferous called for and delivered a
th short, sterning and eloquent address to
ur the I eople assembled congratulating the
ig Bad and citizens for thus honoring one
en who had nobly done his duty as a citizen
mIs of the land and as the exponent of right a
e and justice against persecution, wrong ti
Sand oppression. Ending with the sen
a timent, "Let us deliver up the keys of
id our city, and to our honored guest, throw
ur open the door ofour dwelling s and make
Mr. King's stay a pleasrut and agree- T
sable one, while in oor midst"' The a
whole proceeding was an impromptu af.
At fair, but none the loss reflects credit
te upon our citizens, and plainly shows
ir that the winter and spring of 1879 have
I. left an indellible impression upon their
e minds, and that they are not unmindful m
o of the invaluable services rendered them
h in the dark days of their persecution.
