MARY ASHLEY TOWNSEND—(XPARIFFA.)
Through the ambient spaces swinging
hark.
Comes a voice of welcome ringing ! Dark
And heavy has my heart lain broken,
while
It longed for one such token, one such
smile,
Massachusetts !
I have bowed in dust and ashes, scarred
Fnnly by defiling lashes, marred
l'y ttiose who, iu my proud and palmy
days,
Loved best to twine my balmy wreath of
bays,
Massachusetts.
1 have drooped despised in anguish—yea,
Foes have laughed to see me languish
they
Have cursed nie, scourged 1110 and up
braided—gilds !
I lay unarmed, unaided 'neath their rods,
Massachusetts !
Ruf , in hours of my unsparing woe—
Flood and Famine at me staring—lo !
I, growing helpless, faint and gasping there
A hand felt clasping mine in my despair,
Massachusetts!
And that hand poured fourth its treasure,
fair \
Oolden without stint or measure, where
II. feil and feeds like heavenly rnanna yet.,
And Louisiana never can forget
Massachusetts !
From thy hearth was caught, the ember
brand
W hieb lired the souls of my September
band.
My martyred heroes rushed to battle then,
And Concord's musket-rattle rang again,
Massachusetts !
Sisters from one sire descomled, we
Tyrants'chains alike have rernled. See!
Louisiana, wronged, blasphemed, undone—
Now free, redeemed, responds to Lexing
ton,
Massachusetts.

A little feather that begins to be felt
on the St. Louis cotton market is men
tioned in the Dcmoorat. The rate of
insurance in St. I^uis cotton ware
houses is two and à bnlf per cent.,
while it is only one per cent, in New
Orleans and other Southern cities.
Cotton probably rates as extra hasar
dons among St. Ijiniis underwriters j
and some Texan who ships to that mar
ker may find that it' rates the samo
way as a commercial venture.—] (Jul*

Well," said the land agent, "the

The Next Congress .—2'ho New
York World gives a statement, of tho
political complexion of the next, Con
gress. The Senate, it, says, will con
sist of 41 republicans ami 33 democrats
and indépendants. In the Senate, 11s
it is at present constituted, the repub
licans have 25 majority over the com
bined opposition. If the democrats
have but modest luck, two years hence
the republican majority in the Senate
will bo completely dissipated. Accord
ing to the latest returns, conceding tho
republicans two of tho doubtful dis
tricts nnd claiming the other two for
the opposition, the editor makes the
following party classification of tho
representatives already elected: Demo
crats 170, independents 4, total oppo
sition majority, 73. There are 17 rep
resentatives to be elected in California,
Connecticut, Mississippi, and New
Hampshire, States represented in the
present Congress by 4 democrats and
13 republicans. If they should re
turn the same or others of a like politi
cal faith, the opposition would have fi4
majority in the Hortse. The republi
can majority iu the present House is
nearly 100
Ci** Roth as a matter of public inter
est and a matter of precaution, tho
forthcoming publication of the records
of the War will be hailed with consid
erable joy. An item in the Sundry
Civil bill gave the Secretary of War
$15,000 to begin tho preparation of tho
work for (he Public Printer. The re
cords will include all orders, telegrams,
leporls, and other official papers con
nected with the Confederates as well
as the Union armies. The object of
the Government, iu making these docu
ments public is two-fold. Tho origi
nals are continually subject to danger
of destruction by fire, of mutilation for
private ends, or of abstraction. Ry
multiplying them indefinitely this dan
ger would be disposed of. Moreover,
as they are necessary to a complete
history of the War, it is now time to
give them to the public. It is gratify
ing (o know that even the minutest de
tails have been carefully preserved,
and that tho archives of both tho
Union and the Confederacy are iu such
excellent order that any document can
bo produced when asked for. Thero
can be no question but that the ab
straction of tho records in tho Rue)I
court martial pointed out at any late,
one of the dangers incident upon delay
in publishing the whole mass. It is
! further stated that Gen. Belknap has
accidentlly come into possession of a
1 Vi d'iable collection of records pertain
jD ^ to t(ie Kevo | uti , inttry VVflTi wl , ow
existence was neveu even surmised,
They are the official records of 7'inn|
thy Pickering, Quartermaster-Gene«!
of the patriot army in the Revolution
ary War, and but for an accident would
have been sent to a paper-mill with
out seeing the light. They wer»
' h>und iu the garrett of an old house in
: Philadelphia which was being torn
1 ( ' c,w A large sum of money wan de
