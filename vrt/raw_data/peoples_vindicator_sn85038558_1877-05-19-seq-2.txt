Old WhlEism.
Politiial parties in the history of
An., ica have nnoupied positthons, and
eingaged the attention of great minds,
aereonling to the doetrin" advnocated
and the mncsures pronrrnared in plat
forms. on tihe l hinstings or in legishi
tive halls. ]But no pnrty since tile
fonndation of the gnovernment has
been so essentially an opposition par
ty as the ohl Whig fparty. Its prin
cipal life and sustenance was from
its opposition to the D)emocratic par
ty np to the bijthi of know-nothing
isln into which it was merged and
lost, and it n onird never .iave been
henrd of nagain, hut for thli nsame spirit
of opposition. Most of the old lead
ei h;ave passed away, while otlhers
have foundl place in the ranks (in the
South) of tile I)emocratie party, and
have been honored with high trusts
and exaited positions. Nevertheless
there still lives a few old opposition
ist, ready now to spring to the front
and proclaim to the American people
that they "never were Dem'ocrats and
never will be." Willing to receive
place and position at the hands of
tile Democrats, when their party was
considered dead and bli'ierd, now
that the danger has been bridlged
over, and peace restored once more to
our distracted country, the old feelL
ing revives in them and the hope
springs in their breast that they can',
with the electric spark of a grand op
position, resurrect the dead carcass
of the defunct organization, clothe it
with the garments of borrowed youth,
and find once more favor at the hands
of the American people. Who made
the great fight against the vandal
im ofl the lepublican party 1 Who
stood rp manfully through these long
weary years of plunder and persecn
tion battling for the constitntional
ighlts of tile people constantly threat
ened and endangered by this same
Republican party ! Was there any
Whigism then f Was any old Line
Whig heard to say, "Now is the time
for our party to come to the front 'f"
No ! but all eyes were turned to, and
all hopes centered on the great Na
tional Democratic party for relief,
and nobly have these hopes been ful
filled. The battle has been fought
by it alone, and now that peace is
restored to our happy country andl
the once powerful Republican organ
ization weakened and its forces scat
tered, old Whigism wants to rear its
head and claim favors never deserved.
Unmindful of the debt of gratitude
due the Democratic party, these old
line Whigs would call off their few
followers and revel in the pleasures
ofa separate organization, living on
the food of their life long existence,
oppasftion, to the Deruocratic party.
All political parties that have existed
in these United States have or will
perish andi die out, simply froiii tihe
fact that they always from mlatters of
expediency violated tile solemn coni
pact of tile constitution, fior whichi
the people have been and always will
be relldy to rebuke any sunch liberty.
Whilelike thie needle to tile North
pole the great Demuocratic party
steered by tile conrtitution, and noth.
ing but the constitution.
MA.ror REXo.--'I'e following in tihe
suit of the proceedings of the court
malrtinal at Fort Ahercrombie, which
recently tried Maj. Relno on a a clhange
of having made inmproper overtures
to the wife of Capt. Bell, and having
taken means to cast alors on iher
character:
War Deainrtment, May 8, 1877.
The proceedings in this case, having
been forwarded, under tie 106th ar
ticle of war, to tile Secretary of War,
have been submitted to the PI'easkilelt
who approves tile finiding and se
tence, but is pleased to mitigate tbe
latter to suspension from rank and
pay for two years fromt tile 18th of
May, 1877. Maj. Reno's conduict to
ward the whole force of his power as
conmmanding officer of the post to
gratify his resentment against her,
cannot be too strongly condemlned,
but after long deliberation upon nall
tihe circumstances of tihe ease as
sliown in tile record of tihe trial, it is
thought that his grave offenses, grave
as they alre, do not warrant sentence
of dismissal, and all its consequences
upon one who has for twenty yeallrs
brne tile relputation of a brave manil
and hionorable officer, and has main
tai lned that repntation Iupon battle
fields of the riebellion, and in contests
with Indians. Tile President has
thelefore modified the sentence, and
it is hoped that Major Reno will sp.
preeate tile clemency thus shlIowIn hiin
as well as tile very reprehensible
character of the acts of which he was
gnuilty.

Pentecost.
f To-morrow, (Sunday) is the
great feast in the Catholic Church
of Pentecost. The word is fromn
Sthe (reek, and signifies fiftletlh,
as it was a teast held on the flf
tieth day after the passo verith
celeblrationi of the ingatliering'
and thanksgiving for the hIrvest.
In the C'atholic Church it Is a
solemn feast, being the day of the
(descent of the Holy Ghost oni the
Apostles, and also the day oh
which they began to preach the
religion of Christ, and him cruel
fled.
From an early period of the
Church, this day has been regard
edl as one of the great festivals of
the Christian year, and has always
been considered propitious for the
administration ot the solemn rite
of baptism.
It is also known as Whit"un
1 day, from the fact that the Cotn
municants were always clothed in
f white robes, as emblematic of
their slpiritual purification. The
services of the Church are partic
I ulary directed to the Third Person
of the Blessed Trinity.
To-morrow, at the Cathedral,
this feast is to be celebrated with
imposing ceremonies, and man.y
of the young people will make
r fltheir first connmunion, which is a
very im'portant epoch in the life a
R young christian. The Church will
Pbe Ibeautifnlly decorated with flow

Letter of Adherence from a Col

NE:w ORL.EANS, ,.IA., Itay 2, 1877.
To Gor. F. T. Nicholls:
DEARn StI--I am proud to' have all
occasion to write to you. iear sir, I
am a rlepublican, and I was olspose'd
to Von and your governnment. bhecalase
I am a Republican and you were ai
Democrat, and I thought that you
were opposed to the freedom of my
rai(ce, but I hope we may find in you
a a firm friend; I hope you will carry
out the pledges that you made to us
in your last canvass-that you wouild
give to us equal protection before the
I law ; give us all the representation in
the government that we are entitled
to.
If yon carry out this in good faith
$ you will obliterate the color line in
this State. and kill the name of bull
Stlozers and bury them forever, and
then yon will see blacks and whites
fall in line and say "God has sent
Sthe Gleat Messiah who has been so
s long prayed fori in this country." And
you will have the confidelnce of both
me and my race, and the next tour
yetars ,yu will see htlh Republicans
a nm Deemocrats unlited to youlr sup
I port. All we want is to have tlhe
I confidence of the peopli, we have h,
live with. It is given to yvo to do this
e wonde-rful and needful work. and I
f hope you will do tlis wilh unflinching
- conrage, and not be led in any other
Sway. We know that you cani give
peace to this country, and we hope
yon will do this; and we believe you
'iwill do this, and I will do all I cali to
help you. My people conie to ime
Severy dlay anud ask Ime wihat I think of
Gov. Niclholls I I tell thelll I believe
yim will do as much for them as they
could ask from any governmeat. I
am in favor of your policy to appoint
Shonest a:ld competent nien taf oilce.
- I hold an o flice under your adminis
tration as Justice of the Peace, anid 1
Sam not a man of great learning, but
I believe that I have conmlnmon sense
enough to do justice between ntan
and mlan. I hold a commissioni under
K. ellogg's administration. I was
elected on the seventh day of last
November, but I did not receive a
- commission under your admninistra
Stion. If it is necessary that I should
-have your commiission, please send it
Sto me thait I may qualify under it.

And Louisiana saves.

Some Carpet-h:tgging fetter breaks
To shaow that still she lives.

If Dr. Ooodloe had not ac'cused t1s of
mistuepresentilng the murder and robblery
ill this ft'se, we should not have written
anything miiore about it, but since he
says that the atfair was gtfssly misrep

Ifirdet iand robhlety is concerned. we are
able to prove what we have said. We
will setnd to the VINDICATOR before long,
a letter that we have which will give
some light on Dr. Evans, alias S. M.
Cook. We have not time at present to
prepare a colpy of it. We have set in to
see this thing out, and we intend to do
it, it we live; as to Dr Goodfoe being in
jail as an accomnplice, is a mistake; though
suspicion rests upon .him; that is all,
there may be before the uffair is settled,
more of it.
We willsend a copy of a letter next
week that will give some light on Dr.
Evans', alias Cook's character.
