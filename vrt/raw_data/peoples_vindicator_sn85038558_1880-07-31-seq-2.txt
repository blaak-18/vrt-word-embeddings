Last Monday, the merchants of paper
our eity held a meeting, the oestensit oDules
ble object of which was to form them- to be
solves into a soolety to resist the es- Wobe
orbitalt freight hargese of the Pool of thi
Line of Steanboats. The proceed- book
lage of the preliminary meeting will saved
be found in another column. We
trust the Red River Transportation old
Company, whose oMcers we regard the
as personal friends, will Impedlately e
cal l meeting, and see what they
I an do toward concllating the mer
chabats and busin men of the Red fold
ier valley. toe
It should be remembered, howevert
that In the low water season, whedk ho
freight has to be lightered over the here
numerous bars, the freight rates fo
barely pay espeses. It should also oe
be remembered shat In the high moe
water season, when there Is little ex- ,thi
pease and trouble In transportlng ease
freight, opposition boats are nvited Io
and eneouraged. But when the low awho
water seaeon arrives, and their ex. Ilizat
peasms are eonsequently heavy, theydea
abandou the trade.
What wonder is It, then, the Pool
Line protsotl taelf while t ean? If old
an othe linHae will take the frelght eel
the yea round at a more reasonable
ate, it is ight and proper It should thi
be encouraged, but to give the trade
In the winter, and then have them once
abandon It when the river falls we d
would, t seeLns to use, be a suleidal saw
a poljl. o Iol
It Is right and proper for our mer- deHto
chants to protect themselves, if poea
s sble, against exhorbitant freight
rates. But let us reason together. o
I I it not possible that a portion of
the freight which the Pool Line cooon
tracted for was given to other boats ?
o It such was the case, the omeers of
the Inoe should have made a note of
It, and charged them aooordingly.
Those that act in good faith should doyi
not be made to suffer for dellnquents.
SHere is where the error lies. Lm me
ustice be done, though the heavens oi
fall. We claim to be no oracle on Sa
thirsubjeot, Our only object is the
benefit of this section. We very
muoe hbar that It would be a dfficult
matter to get any other company to a I
do our carrying trade In the low
water season. Our remarks, how
ever, are marely suggestions. Our
fMibnds ,saa a upon them as they
abink proper. We are no defendefr ond
