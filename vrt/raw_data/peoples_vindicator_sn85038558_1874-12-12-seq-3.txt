go on freit*; to.eose, until the
parish becomqs atterly overwhelmed

First, let as consider the question

Smmouat to st oea million of dol

in the town l'atslhbiteohes, which

revenue to dervrd to be parish,
after dedueinf , gp mes of collee

be about $*1s I a- year. This is
about one half theim coft espenses

" Let it also' be expreslty stipulated
e that no extra compesation shall be
granted to say parish official above
the salary and fees establishled, an
der any prete whatsoever,
SAnotlher very considerable reduc
a thin can be made by having the
t. tPaks0 of JURlts Atmtb WH* saes OL
ISHED.
'y Let a special law be pasMed that the
s- fees and per diem of grand and petit
at jurors, of jurors nad witnesses on cor
ly oners' inquests, and of all witnesses id
,- oriminal cases before any' cqrt in
at the parish, are abolished, snd .that
e lbereafter me compensaties for sech
il service shall be allowed;) provided,
that no petit juror shall be compelled
in to serve more than oun 'eek' in every
le three years, and he grandjuror more
s, than at one term of the district ecomt
I-in levery three years.
l ThePolice Jury should also be re
t stricted in the building of bridges
-e and other ::," .. .
SPUBLIC WORMK.
Thus: No public works ahall be
i specially contracted for, but shall in.
all cases be let to the lowest bidder,
after due advertisement, reserving
the right to reject all' bid .. Nor
i shall any such work be daie' until
there are funds in '.the treasaury over
and above such reseryations asu have
f precedence. . .
a These are the principal reforms
which present themselves to smy mind.
The restrictions are. neeeiary even
under a good governmeit, as the best
of men sometimes go stray' by idfla
a ence of friendship or Interest, or
-t through iudifference to the pdblio
t good. The retrenchmnents in tees
anid salaries leave a good margin of
e income to the various public officials,
whed their civil and other fees are
taken into consideration. " For ex
s ample, let us take the sheriff'ls oficee
I under the retrenchments suggested.
t le receives a salary Is money of
S*000 a year for criminal businses.
and about $500 in criminal fees Out
of this he pays two depitlie, say $10
each, or $1500 a year. :These :dep,
utes perform all civil service Msal
so that he has $500 nett a year on
criminal business, and the hire tiand
expenses of his deputies paid. He re;.
I evec $15 a mouth each for feeding
" prisoners, or about' $1500 .a year.i
3 all..at of which le ought to .make
SM500., His civil fees will amount .to
$- 1500: or $000 merea A' nett 'in
come of $8510 or $3000 per annum,
I which islelenty. And so with other
olfcials.
Now let as compatr the total ex

and new regimes for one year :

pens than mine ought to take It up,
and present it in all its phaseoto the
public mbind through your columns, as
a matter of greater practical value
than any other at this time. For, un
less this is done, and our system of
parish fiuances entirely remodeled,
,the recent conservative victory will
prove barren of positive imelioration,
and possess only "the iegativeviartue
of the absence of corruption.

ART ni PAlTikw T ,1874. ,
The illntratius of the AtDxa bhare
won a world-wide reputation, and in the
art eentres of Europe it is an admitted that
that its wood onto are.examples of the
highest perfectiop ever attained. The
common pruadice in favor o'f 'steel plate'
Is rapidly yielding to'a'inore edueated and
dierin lnatlng taste Which reeoguites the
adfrantages and sunperior artistic quality
with greater raility of production. The
wooda-ente Of the Awna possess all the
delicaey and elaborate finish of the most
costly steel plate, while they afford a bet
ter remaderig of the artist's original.
To fully realipse the wonderful work
which the Aldine is doing for the cause of
art culture in America, it in only neces
sary to consider the cost to the people of
any other decent representations of the
productions of great painters.
In addition to designs by the members
of the National Academy and other noted
American "rtista, the Aldine will repro
duce examples of the best Ioreign master,
selected with .a view to the highest arti.
tic mecess and greatest general interest.
Thus the subedriber to the Aldine will, at
a trifling cost, enjoy n his own home the
pl es2 Miad rel~luig inlluences of true
art.
