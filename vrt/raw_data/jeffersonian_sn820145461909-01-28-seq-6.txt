ZETTERY THE PEOPLE
ASKS ABOUT “BETHANY.”
ASKS ABOUT ‘ ‘BETHANY. ’ ’
Watkinsville, Gia., Jan. 18, 1909.
My Dear Mr.. Watson:
I have just finished “Bethany,”
and desire to thank you for this sad,
sweet book.
To me you appear very different in
this book from what you do in any
thing else you have ever written. I
have long admired you, and some
times condemned, but never before
reading “Bethany” did I have the
feeling of love for you. I think if our
people would all read this touching
story, and, in it, the author Js own
heart and soul, you would be better
understood, or, at least, sometimes
less harshly judged.
I desire to ask if the killing of the
North Carolina soldier, who deserted,
in the presence of his wife and two
little girls really happened as related.
Also if General Johnston killed the
gallant soldier boy in the West as
related. These, incidents are so hor
rible and inhuman that I am con
strained to ask you this, though I
note you say it is a true story.
Again, was Uncle Ralph your un
cle, really?
It seems to me I recall that your
father died a few years ago? I sup
pose this (your orphanage) a devia
tion from real life. Your pathetic lit
tle boyhood arouses such a deep in
terest in you that I ask.
Yes, in justice to you, Mr. Watson,
I think the people of the South, at
least, ought to read Bethany.
It shows better than anything the
softer, tenderer side of Axm, the side
that may naturally not be seen or
discovered by those who see you only
in the carnage of conflict.
There are many things I could ask
you about in Bethany, but it would
take too much of your time.
(Answer: The facts about the
North Carolina soldier, who was shot
in the presence of his wife and chil
dren, were given me by Adolphus E.
Strother, of Lincoln county, Georgia.
He witnessed the tragedy.
The facts of the murdering of the
soldier who transferred himself from
the Confederate infantry to the Con
federate cavalry, were related to me
by Capt. Phil Carroll, of Augusta, Ga.
It is hardly necessary to say that
Mr. Strother and Capt. Carroll served
as Confederates, and that two braver
men never wore a uniform.
In the letters of Maj. Jos. B. Cum
ming, published in Jeffersonian Maga
zine of February, 1909, Capt. Car
roll’s story is corroborated in all es
sential particulars.
My father was removed from the
scene, for the purposes of the story,
and my own age was advanced several
years, but, with these exceptions, the
story told in “Bethany” is a true one.
“Uncle Ralph” was William A. Wat
son, my youngest uncle. On his death
bed he gave me his gold sleeve-but
tons, and one of the crudest sacri
fices imposed upon me by the poverty
of my youth was that these buttons
and some other things of like kind had
to be pawned to raise a small sum of
money. The pawnbroker was a thief,
and the articles were irretrievably
lost.
Os course, the speeches .which ap-
pear in the book are my own com
positions. Toombs and Stephens had
no debate on the stump; and of the
Herschel V. Johnson speech against
secession no vestige remains, except
ing the opening sentences.
Without any exception, the inci
dents related in the book are taktn
from life; the characters were real
men. Toombs Cullars yet lives, as
jolly, and whole-souled a fellow as
you’d meet anywhere. His mesmate
was Adolphus Strother, whose sketch
of his own army-life was the basis of
the narrative in “Bethany.”
The other incidents which give the
“atmosphere of verity” to the story
were obtained by a careful reading of
hundreds of war-time newspapers. I
had a file of the Augusta Chronicle,
and also of the Savannha News, cov
ering the entire period of the Civil
War. These faded records of the past
were of inestimable value to me in
making my wo*k conform to the
truth.

D. E. Graham, Comer, Ga., December
25, 1908:
“Enclosed find SI.OO for the Jeffer
sonian Magazine. I’d rather have the
Jeffersonian than any other magazine
I have ever seen.”
«
J. Roy McGinty, Atlanta, Ga., Decem
ber 22, 1908:
‘ ‘ I feel sure the next four years will
work a great change for the better
with the masses of the people. Let
us begin right now to organize all true
Jeffersonians. The cause will not be
bettered any by changing the name,
and there a true reformer who
need be ashamed of the name Popu
list.
“Our campaign accomplished one
big thing, at least. The people have
been awakened to the fact that a
‘solid South’ means political slavery.
Who but the Pops agitated this ques
tion during the campaign? Nobody.
Now the political ‘big guns’ all over
the South are discussing it.
“Enclosed find money order for
$4.00 for which send the following.”
Wm. S. Murray, -Skyland, N. C., De
cember 21, 1908:
“Enclosed find $2.00 to renew my
subscription -to the two Jeffersonians.
Should have renewed earlier. Please
excuse delay and don’t think I have
deserted you and the grand cause you
advocate and the noble principles for
which you have sacrificed so much
time and talent. Don’t be discour
aged. Millions of men are beginning
to think and get their eyes open. You
know a puppy gets its eyes open in
nine days, while it takes the average
voter twice that number of years to
see the workings of the machine politi
cians ’ scheme to fool the people.”
R. J. Busbee, Reynolds, Ga., who
sent list of subscribers and money
order on December 20, 1908. writes:
“This list is mostly at,my own ex
pense. It is my desire to get the pa
per in as many mail boxes as I can. I
wish the people could understand and
appreciate the author of R. F. D,
enough to take his paper,”'

R. E. Pickens, Umbarger, Texas, De
cember 19, 1908:
“Enclosed find $2.00 to renew
subscription to the weekly and the
magazine. They are good company.
I hope they will keep right on im
proving, growing and spreading.”
A. M. Morrow, Decatur, Miss., Decem
ber 24, 1908:'
“Enclosed find money order for re
newal to the two Jeffersonians. I don’t
want any discount. I know the sacri
fice you have made in regard to Popu
list principles and fully appreciate
the great work you have done and are
still doing. I will not desert our
principles as long as there is need of
reform, or life lasts.”
J. W. Hill, McDonough, Ga., Decem
ber 28, 1908:
“Enclosed find renewal to the Jef
fersonians. You can depend on me
as a lifetime subscriber.”
L. G. Canfield, Center Hill, Arkansas,
Dec. 26, 1908.
“Enclosed find $2.00 for the Week
ly and Monthly Jeffersonian. Can’t
get along without them. Let’s have
a conference of all reformers and a
new party for the next campaign.”
Lorenzo Elliott, Farina, 111., Decem
ber 25, 1908.
“I am still in the middle-of-the
road. Sixty years old and an old
Union soldier. I have got to have
something good to read. Find enclos
ed a dollar for the weekly Jeffersonian
for a year.”
J. D. Bozeman, Quitman, Ga., Decem
ber 25, 1908:
“Enclosed find $2.50 for the two
Jeffersonians and a small ad. in the
weekly. I hope you are not discour- ,
aged. Let’s keep the camp fires burn
ing, for we can all see things gradu
ally coming our way. I am going to
stand by the ship as long as you, our
pilot, stay at the helm.”
J. W. Foster, Galveston, Texas, De
cember 21, 1908:
“Some eighteen months or more
ago I said to you (by letter) that
there is no public man of any conse
quence, beside yourself, in this coun
try, who possessed sufficient patri
otism or courage to declare himself
against the baneful influence and per
nicious practices of the hierarchy.
That opinion gains strength as the
days go by.”
J. J. Bridges, Gainesville, Ga., Decem
ber 20, 1908:
“As others are writing I will send
my little mite. I spent about eight
or ten dollars during the last cam
paign for posters for your meeting,
mailing them and tickets, etc. Here
is one of those seventeen thousand
that is going to stay. Why not?
When public sentiment is coming our
way, and even the President seems to
be catching on. May your strength
hold good till every evil law is re
placed with a good one. Please find
check for $2.59 for the two Jefferso
nians and other papers on clubbing
list. ’ ’
B. T. Collins, Ellisville, Miss., Novem
ber 10, 1908:
v “I wish to say, too, that I am a
Jeffersonian, and that you cannot
realize how much myself and others
in my neighborhood appreciate you.
You have been our leader so long we
can’t do without you, and we are not
going to try to do without you.
“If you can come to Ellisville,
Miss., and make us a speech, let me
know what it will cost far enough in
advance so that I can make up the
money for you. I am sending a dol
lar to help pay what you are out in
the last campaign, but I don’t want
you to think that this is the extent of
my appreciation of your work, but
merely the extent of my ability at
present. I will send more later.”
R. F. Persons, The Rock, Ga.:
“Enclosed find money order for re
newal to the magazine and 25 cents
to the weekly. I can’t do without the
papers. They are the only ones that
tell the truth.”
B. F. Wills, Dallas, Ga.:
“If every reader of the Jefferso
nian would give the little sum of one
dollar, Mr. Watson could go on with
his gallant fight. Let us prove our
faith by our works. While writing I
send SI.OO for the Jeffersonian.”
P. B. Traylor. Chipley, Ga.:
“In response to offer for renewals
I enclose $2.00. It would indeed be a
great deprivation to me and mine to
be without either the Magazine or the
Weekly Jeffersonian. I pray earnestly
that all men may see things govern
mental as they really exist and walk
boldly out into the sunlight of politi
cal liberty.”
Charles Jenkins, Pleasant Lake, Ind.:
* “Enclosed find postal order for
$2.00; please send the two Jefferso
nians for the coming year. Have been
voting for currency reform for twen
ty-eight years without a break; have
spent thousands of dollars and twenty
of the best years of my life, and now
When I am verging on my four-score
years there is but one frail prop to
keep the country from anarchy or
military despotism,—The Referen
dum. ’ ’
Tom A. Dolan, Aragon, Ga., Decem
ber 1, 1998:
“When I wrote in May last I told
you that I would answer to the roll
call while life lasts, but should I fail
to respond you might note the fact
that another comrade had been mus
tered out. For the next, four years
you may rely upon me to make a
small remittance to whatever plan
may be agreed upon for national edu
cation in Jeffersonian principles.”
John W. Denton, White Clay, Nebr.,
December, 1908:
“My letter of December 10th con
tained SIO.OO and was sent from Ada
tion. I am going to send the Mis
souri World $2.00. How it does hurt
me that they had to stop the good old
‘World.’ God pity those who will
not help, with their money, the re
form cause to make better conditions
for the little ones coming after us.”
