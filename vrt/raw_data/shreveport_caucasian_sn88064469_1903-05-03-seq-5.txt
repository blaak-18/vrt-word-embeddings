sometimes two or three, one above the
other. but al` below the stole arrange
ment of lace.
The Monte C'arlo coats seem to be
particularly well adapte4 for decora
tion in this style, and most of them do
have the lace down the front. The
heavy Irish crochet lace is more showy
and, in fact, better than any other ex
cept the renaissance, but many s r
fer the relief of the Irish point. It
sets up so well on any kind of material
and shows like sculpture when put
upon cloth in one of the soft and beau
tiful pastel shades so well liked for
handsome tailor suits. In saying "tai
lor suits" in this connection I do not
mean the gowns worn in the street for
all occasions, for the delicate colors
and tints are impossible for such re
quirements, but the dresses are finish
ed in the perfection that is called tai
lor made. Every seam is pressed and
finished so that the gown seems to
have grown together. On such a dress
the Irish lace shows like incrustations
of ivory carving. Some of these fine
broadcloth gowns have a short coat of
the same stuff, and while the dress is
incrusted with the lace the coat has
a stoic down the front. Few of thane
show any attempt at a high collar, but
the dresses still reach the chin.
Thin dresses are so pretty that S
scarcely know where to begin to speak
of them. The very prettiest is the
skirt moderately long in front and
demitrain in the back, with five or six
narrow ruffles at the bottom, and the
full gathered back. Many dainty thin
frocks have folds down the skirt to
flounce length, and there they are let
loose, to form a graceful and desira
ble fullness. Sometimes these plaits
are arranged in clusters, and they also
are left to form a flounce at the hem.
but between the clusters of folds there
are set diamonds of castle braid and
lace. These come in three and four
sizes, so that the small ones are used
on the waists and the larger ones on
the skirt.
I saw a beautiful dresF at one of the
big stores. It was made of lace of a
delicate all over trailing design. The
underskirt was ivory white taffeta.
and skirt and lining were made up to
,gether, so that when the seams were
sewed the folds came under in fan
shape, in a way to show the delicacy
of the lace in the dress. Down each
seam in the skirt there was a line of
heavy Irish point made so' that the
ends fell on the side of the fan shaped
folds. The waist was blouse shaped,
with a pelerine cape of the lace edged
by the Irish point. This also was laid
all around the hem of the skirt.
Among the novelties is th, linen
cheviot with the little rough knots over
the surface. It is made into everyday
street costumes and is generally treat
ed like the woolen cheviots. The col
orings are the same, and they are'
strap stitched and slot seamed like the
woolen stuffs. Some have blouses
with sailor collars, while others have
the regulation snug basque effect.
A dress of tfiis.durable and satisfac
tory materiel had long flared and.dou
ble slot stitched seams, besides a whole
lot of other stitching wherever it could
be added. The bodice was snug, with
a tiny postilion at the back. It but
toned closely in front and had a turn
over collar, a high white linen collar,
a. chemisette and a narrow black tie.
How neat this looked beside the very
frivolous yet beautiful frippery of the
fanciful lace and other thin dresses
with all their fluffy daintiness! It was
water in a desert.
The new hats? Oh, no; not this time.

A young lady _f fashion lately met
with a disastrous blow. She had a
party gown made aecording to an "ex
clusive" model. She depended on thy'
dressmaker not to permit any common
trash to get hold of the model and copy
it. The dressmaker, in the face of a
prospect of gain, proved faithless and
built another girl's gown on the same
pattern. "Of course now % can never
wear the dress," said the first girl in
dignantly. *ear, dear! *his is dread
ful.
A reverend gentleman recommends
the founding of a school to teach girls
to become good wives. Yes..yes. But
it would be much more to the point if
the reverend gentleman should look at
his own side of the house and found a
school to teach men to become good
husbands. They need it more than
women do, heaven knows. Moreover.
there is much talk of mothers' clubs.
It is abouttime we had a few fathers'
clubs for a change. Mothers hack been
preached at by church and state for
forty centuries, while it has been sup
posed that any old thing would do for
a father. It is a grievous mistake that
one civilization is suefering most griev
ously for. Give us some societies for
the improvement of fathers!
The loveliest creature on this planet
is just a bright, sweet, pretty girl.
There is an actual radiance about her.
What a glorious saying that is of the
minister who said, "While a woman is
not to blame for having been born
ugly, she is distinctly blamable if she
Is ugly in old age?"
Well bred women never play practi
cal jokes.
It is a wonder that more women do
not learn to prepare the bottled mara
schino cherries, so called. They are
high priced, but any woman who lives
in the country and has cherry trees of
fine quality can prepare the fruit in
this way.. In general- in the canning
and preserving of cherries an exquisite
flavor may be given to the fruit by the
seeds. Stone the fruit carefully, lay
ing aside the seeds. With a hammer
crush the cherry stones, so that the
delicate, almondlike flavor of the inner
pulp may be got at. Put the crushed
stones and seeds into a little bag along
with the sugar intended to sweeten the
cherries and boil to a sirup to be poured
over the fruit previous to cooking it.
I wish people would not send me
letters in those awful black bordered
mourning envelopes. It always gives
me a scare.

This was very poetic and idyllic, so S
save been at pains to tell of it, but
there is more to it. That is, that the
two friends before they knew it were
madi'e so hungry by the glorious sea
air--or was it the sun tonic which so
stimulated their dige:Ition?-that the
"hunk" of gingerbread they had
brenought with them was too small.
Near by was a pretentious restaurant
that had all the luxuries of the season
placarded upon its outsides and little
besides oldish doughnuts and baked
beans in its insides. The women took
a seat at a table and asked for the soft
shell crabs on the bill of fare.

for these to materialize before the cus

by faith and not by sight.
The friends left the delusive place
and wandered disconsolate. 'A know

roast frankfurters. Set us have sore
frankfurter sandwiches."

clean: so was his outfit. Oe had a row
of frankfurters upon a sheet iron plate

Well, the two respectable ladies were
so hungry that they each ordered a
frankfurter sandwich. The frankfur
ter roaster split a well baked bread
roll, whisked a sausage upon it with a
fork, handed it to the customer and
said, "Help yourself to mustard."
The ladies did so; then. bold and un
abashed. started down again to the
sunny corner in the sand. A row of
rowdies, idle waiters and Coney Island
fakirs lined the walk on each side. As
the ladies went past them. carrying
each her frankfurter sandwich, some
of these fellows uttered mournful dog
howls and others barked. "Bow. wow.
wow!"'
Nevertheless the frankfurters fasted
extremely good. and the ladies de
voured them with relish, even the one
who frowned on frankfurters owning
that they were very nice. When the
women started home, they passed
again the frankfurter stand. There
was the man roasting sausages still.
with the absorbed air of an artist and
an enthusiast. as though world move
ments depended on the perfect cooking
of those tiny pink meat rolls. The wo
man who does not like frankfurters
told the man that his were the best she
ever tasted. His face brightened up at
the compliment.
"There's lots more in roasting frank
furters than a body would think," he
said. "You have tb watch 'em every

somebody to roast 'em for me and
