It is only a question of time
when the people of Lafayette will s
have to do the same. A system of
waterworks is an indispensable ad- E
junct to a town that sets up any
pretensions to being a town. Our
people, like those of Opelousas, are
entirly too slow, and, in the lan
guage of the street, unless they I
"put a move on tliemselves" their '
more progressive neighbors will
leave them so far behind that they I
will be lost sight of in the race of I

A Garbage Cart.
A corporation or garbage cart is
a thing that every one-horse town
in the State would not be without,
and yet, Lafayette, with her jooo
population has never had one. As
a consequence our streets are the
dumping grounds for cans, oyster
shells, broken bottles, glasses, and
everything which people have no
use for in their yards. We under=
stand that at the present time the
municipal authotrities have not any
spare cash, but we believe that they
should engage the services of a cor
poration cart at their earliest con
venience:

was tendered by the council to Mr.
A. A. Micaud the retiring town
marshal, for faithful and efficient
services rendered by him during his
term.
Now that Ike Broussard has pre
sented to Baron Natili his edu

The receiver of the Teche Railroad

lars to the various creditors of that
company, wherein he submits a
proposition that the property be
taken out of the hands of the court,

the creditors as the stock holders,
to be classified as follows: The
present mortgage and lien holders
to receive 5o per cent of their debts
in and mortgage bonds, and the re
maining 5o per cent in stock. The
common creditor to receive So cents
on the dollar on their claims, in
stock of the new company. The
amount of the capital stock to
equal the amount of the revised
schedule. A first szortgage bond
will then be issued for an amount
sufficient to cover the receiver's inU
debtedness and costs of court. It
remains to be seen how the creditors
will accept this proposition.

Say, Mr. Editor, does it not
strike you very forcibly how certain
men ih this parish are of the "swap
coat-with-you" style? Is it not a
fact that some of them have time and
again openly professed and supported
the Republican party, and are to
day posing before 'the public, as
Democrats pure .and white ? Off
all the temerity and audacity this
scribe has ever read about, this new
move by some of the "Profesh" far
excells all. A man may be a De
mocrat, Republican, Populite or
belong to any party he wishes; that
is his right and his business. We al
ways respect his opinion, and ad
mire his convictions, but we have
no utter use for that individual
whose changes are as sudden as the
moon, and who varies as often as
spring showers.
As sure as a duck will swim, some
of the candidates for various offices
at the next election, are now strad- 1
dling the fence awaiting an oppor
tunity to drop; and swear allegiance 1
to the stronger faction. This
may work, but we doubt it much.
The masses have been taught severe
lessons, and unless we are making a
big blunder, every ballot cast at the
next white primary election, will be
to down the professional politician,
whose greed for office makes him
disregard the principles and doc
trines of a party.

By statestics every x6 to so years,
a change of affairs takes place in a
commercial, financial and political
matters. As facts clearly corrobor
ate this statement, and that every
day something unseen, unknown
and unexpected happens, the people
of this parish must not appear sur- '
prised, should some member of the
younger generation buckle on the
armor, and make it 'hilt to hilt"
with those pretending knowing ones.

A Young Man's History.
I first saw hini in a sociil party. Ire took
but one glass of wine, and that at ilie urgent
solictation of a young lady to whom he had
heed introduced.
I iiext saw him, wiled he sailipdaed he was
unseen, taking a glass to satisfy a slight de
sire. He mocked at the thought of danger.
I next saw him, late in the evening, in the
street, unable to walk home. I assisted him
thither, and we parted.
I next saw him reeling out of a low grog
gery. A confused stare was on his counten
ance, and words of blasphemy were on his
tongue, and shame was gone.
I saw him once more. He *as cold add
motionless and was caried by his friends to
his last resting place. In the small proces
slon that followed every head wascast down.
His father's gray hairs were going to the
grave with sorrow; his mother, wept that
she had given birth to such a child.
I returned home, musing on his futurd
state. I opened the Bible and read: "But
not deceived. Dlunkards shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.'"
This is a sad story. Alas, that it should
be true! When-a boy, our poor friend was
as happy and bright as any of us.
More than once, when students together,
did he sneer at my teetotalism. When I
urged him to sign the pledge, he laughed at
me and scoffed at the bare suggestion of
danger.
Poor Fred! His father had the glass on
the table, and there the appetite was formed.
Young men, beware of the first glass. F"ath
ers, banish the glass from your tables if you
would not bury your sons as drunkards.
Narcoties.
The narcotic department has taken for its
motto this year, "The cigarette must go,"
and many good people are working to that
end. A convention of the Anti.Cigarette
Leagues or New York city was held a short
time ago. They have forty thousand boys
pledged. I can furnish constitution and
badges for the Anti-Cigarette League.
The school board of St. Joseph, Mo.,
have given their .attention to the cigarette
evil, and all the members voted for a reso
lution to expel any boy who smokes cigar
ettes, no matter whether the smoker is on or
off the school grounds.
Bills against the cigarette have been in
troduced in the Texas legislature, and our
people in some states are taking up the ques
tion of forbidding the manufacture and sale
of cigarettes. Every W. C. T. U. ought to
work for such a law. I hope our women
will push the work against the cigarettes,
but by no means neglect the opium habit.
Particularly make known the dangers of us
ing headache medicines, soothing syrups,
etc. A crusade ought to be made in all
cities where there are opium dens.
There is to-day a larger army under Its
[the liquor traffic's] control, than went to
the war while those mourning over the vas
salage and fall of loved ones, exceed in
numbers, and in the bitterness of their woe,
the millions who were made childless and
wid6ws by the casualties of that fierce and
sanguinary strife. And the terrible disease,
lhke a cancer, is eating into the very vitals
of the nation, destroying mental and moral,
as well as the physical fibre of the people.
The liguor interest controls the cities and
largely influences state legislation and the
local politics of the country. And all this
has come to pass. notwithstanding the tem
perance efforts of half a century, the preach
ing of the sanctuary, the presence and p.wer
of the Christian church.-Henry Wilson,
vice president of the U. S.
Obituary.
MAY 19, 1895.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
On my return to Quarantine to-day I
found a letter announcing the sad news of
the death of Mme. Jules Guidry, a lady for
whom I entertained the most profound re
spect. I cannot resist the impulse now of
penning the tribute of a sigh and paying the
last sad compliment to one I valued for
many years as a true friend.
For many months she struggled in the re
morseless grasp of a disease against which
the efforts of our profession can avail noth
ing, and on the first of May at 2 p. m. she
was summoned to that "'bourne from whence
no traveler has yet returned:"
•"Her Creator drew her spirit
As the sun the morning dew."
Mlme. Guidry was the daughter of Joseph
Treville Bertrand and Amelie Comeaux of
Cote Gelee. The only member of her far.r
ily still living being my old friend, Oculy
Guidry.
As a wife Mme. Guidry was faithful, kind
and affectionate; as a mother and grand
mother, she was patient, painstaking and
loving; as a neighbor, charitable and kind,
always ready with a genial smile to listen to
the cares of others; as a good and pious
Catholic she accentuated by her life the
teachings of her noble creed. The beauties
of her character like some ancient cameo,
was brought out in bold relief on a bed of
suffering. This principally when stricken
by adversity and disease that the fine traits
of a character are developed, and never
does the halo which surrounds every true
woman gleam so brightly as under these ad
verse conditions. By none will her demise
be more seriously felt than by her imme
diate entourage who has been accustomed to
her kindly smile, and the warm shake of her
hand, now alas! cold with the dews of death.
It is gratifying to know that her remains
were followed to their last resting place by
such a vast concourse of people from all
parts of our parish. I ant informed by one
who was present, that the funeral cortege
was over half a mile long. This is in itself
an evidence of the high esteem in which she
was held by our people. I saw her a short
time before her death; she recognized and
was glad to see me. I noted in her face
that look we see in the faces of dtlying Chris
tian women. "'Drawing near death she
sent most pious thoughts as harbingers to
heaven; and her soul sent a glimtnpse of hap
piness through the chinks of helr sickness
broken body."
WVhen we gaze upon the last moments of a
pious woman who has fully prepared her
self for that sleep that knows no a-wakenitg,
we appreciate the Ilnes of lthe poet:
*'There is no death! ,Vht seems so is transition.
This lite of moratl nreath
Is but a saburb of the life Elysian
Whose portal wae all death.

There has been much talk about

been unable to'obtain positive in

that the news received from parties
interested in the enterprise were de

that similar movents had so often
