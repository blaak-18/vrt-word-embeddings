on the'nervous system by
which the rheumatic
pains are controlled, and
rest and sleep assured.
It has made many cures
of this painful disease,
some of them after years
of suffering. If it * will
cure others why not you.
If your case is compli
cated, write us for advice,
it costs you nothing and
may save you prolonged
suffering.
“I was so crippled that I could
scarcely walk. After having my shoes
on for an hour or two I could manage
to walk by suffering the pain. Then
I began to have pains all through
my system. My doctor told me I had
an acute attack of inflammatory
rheumatism. I read about Dr. Miles’
Nervine, bought a bottle and I com
menced to get better from the start
and for the past six months have
scarcely any pain, and am able to
walk as well as ever.”

Anarchy of Different "Brands
All of us, more, or less, are accus
tomed to hear the word “anarchy”
and “anarchist” used las an epithet,
a word of reproach. And when we
hear it there immediately appears in
our brain a mental picture of a long
haired, be-whiskered, wild-eyed indi
vidual with an aversion for baths and
a penchant for soiled linen and nitro
glycerine.
J. Pierp. Morgan, of irreproachable
habits, considers Roosevelt an anar
chist. Our own Dave Francis once
declared that Bryan-was an anar
chist. Van Cleave, that “Buck”
from St. Louis, says all union labor
men are anarchists, and ought to be
exterminated via the federal courts,
else the country (Van ‘Cleave) will
go to the demnition bow-wows.
But did you ever picture an anar
chist as a smug, well-groomed, clean
shaven, silk-under wear-clad million
aire? 'No? Rather a strange picture
of an anarchist, eh? and one you can
scarcely believe exists. Well, let’s
see.
Anarchy is defined as the “absence
of civil government, the overthrow of
rule by law, consequently disorder
and crime.” An anarchist, therefore,
is defined as “an anarch, one who
advocates the overthrow of civil gov
ernment and the violation of law.”
Not a word about whiskers, long
hair, wild eyes, soiled linen or lack
of personal sanitary precautions. Just
a plain issue between order and dis
order. So anarchy is violation of law
and an anarchist is the one who
urges the violation of, or actually vio
lates, the law.
Now, then, let ’s see how we can ap
ply the rule and measure until we
find the anarchist.
You will recall that the federal
government went after the Standard
Oil Company in Chicago several
months ago and convicted it of re
bating. The government made a good
case and Judge K. M. Landis, one of
the cleanest of our federal judges,
fined the Standard Oil something like
thirty million dollars. Os course,
Landis became an anarchist accord
ing to the Rockefeller dictionary, and
an appeal was taken to an appellate
court.’
Well, the appellate court was not
made up of the Rockefeller brand of
anarchists, so it remitted the fine, re
versed the case, ordered a “new
trial” and then proceeded to de
nounce Judge Landis with a bitterness
that must have been balm to the
crowd from 2G Broadway.
And the man who wrote the opin
ion was Judge Grosscup, at present
under indictment and out on bond be
cause of an Illinois Traction scandal.
The decision was based upon three
points: First, that the Standard Oil
Company of Indiana, was the defend
ant, not the Standard Oil Com
pany of New Jersey. Secondly,
that the assets of the Standard Oil
Company of Indiana were not in ex
cess of one million dollars, hence they
could not be fined thirty million; and
thirdly, that each c«L rebated was not
a separate offense.
3effersoni<m
But it never once said, that the com
pany was NOT guilty of rebating!
Now, let’s study this a moment.
Suppose John Smith is in business in
St. Louis under his own name, and
in Kansas City under (another name
—say, that of Jones. He commits
a crime in Kansas City. Do you
suppose for a minute—Smith being
an ordinary citizen —that any court
is going to protect Smith and punish
only the mythical non-existent
“Jones”? Not in THIS age.
The next argument—that the as
sets of the Indiana company amount
ed to only a paltry million and the
fine was thirty millions. Mr. C. Peo
ple, have you ever heard of a police
judge trying to discover the financial
responsibility of a hobo before as
sessing* a fine which would not ex
ceed his assets? Now, you never did,
did you? Very well, then.
Then the third excuse, that each
car rebate was not a separate of
fense. Let’s see some more. John
Jones steals from Smith and from
Brown and from Johnson. What does
the grand jury do? Does it indict
him on ONE charge or on THREE?
You know the answer. He’ll get
THREE terms in the penitentiary
and no federal judge is going to come
to his aid, either.
But let us all get down to the anar
chy end of this case. It is a little
long coming, but it’s going to be
plain, now that it is here.
As soon as the Grosseup decision
was announced, the attorneys for the
Standard Oil rejoiced and openly de
clared :
“This is a great victory for the
corporations. It means that no cor
poration can be convicted of rebat
ing unless it be proven that the par
ent company had actual knowledge
that there was rebating going on and
that it knew that rebating was con
trary to law.”
Observe again that there is NOT A
WORD IN DENIAL OF CXJM-MIS
SION OF A CRIME; IN FACT, THE
CRIME IS ADMITTED; but simply
a statement that the court in its opin
ion very considerately points out to
trusts and corporations A PATH TO
CRIME UNOBSTRUCTED BY PIT
FALL'S AND LEGAL SNARE
GUNS.
All that is necessary to avoid pen
alties for exacting rebates, accord
ing to their interpretation of the
opinion, is to organize a subsidiary
company, with nominal capitalization,
to carry on its shipping, allowing such
subsidiary company to stand a modi
fied punishment for the illegal acts,
through which the parent company
reaps a rich harvest.
Therefore, we have a brand of an
archist, not new, but only recently in
the limelight. The rich financier and
the hig’h priced corporation lawyer,
openly admitting and advising law
violation and calmly interpreting the
ruling of the court as a suggestion for
escaping the penalties provided by
law.

urges violation of, law and the over
