THE DAUGHTER.
It’s not myself I’m grieving for, it’s
not that I’m complaining,
(He s a good man, is Michael, and
I ve never felt his frown),
But there’s sorrow beating on me like
a long day’s raining
For the little wrinkled face of her
I left in Kerrydown.
(It’s just herself I’m longing for, her
self and no other—
Do you mind the morns we walked
to mass when all the fields were
green?
’Twas I that pinned your ’kerchief, oh,
me mother, mother, mother!
Th® seas > the cruel seas and
half the world between).
’Tis the man’s part to say the word
the wife’s to up and follow—
(It's a fair land we’ve come to and
there s plenty here for all),
And ’tis not the homesick longing that
lures me like a swallow,
But the one voice across the world
that draws me to its call.
(It’s just herself I’m longing for, her
self and no other—
Do vou mind the tales you told me
when the turf was blazing bright 7
Me head upon your shoulder, oh, me
mother, mother, mother—
The broad seas between us and your
self alone tonight!
There’s decent neighbors all about
there’s coming and there’s going;
It s kind souls will be about me "when
the little one is here;
But it’s her word I’m wanting, her
comfort I’d be knowing,
And her blessing on the two of us to
drive away the fear.
(It’s just herself I’m longing for, her
self and no other—
Do you mind the soft spring morn
ings when you stitched the wed
ding gown?
The little, careful stitches, oh, me
mother, mother, mother—
Meself beyond the broad seas and you
in Kerrydown!)

THE DOUBLE STANDARD—WHY?
“What is it? Essence? Spirit?
Breath? or Power?
That universal, fine, etherial thing;
Stretched o’er a thousand years or to
an hour
Compressed—now coming and now
vanishing
Behold within a world sustained by
Heaven,
Where all with vexing mystery is ripe
The greatest, noblest boon to mortals
given,
The grandest mystery of nature—
Life.”
“Life,” nature’s grandest mystery,
and yet at times how very sordid is
human nature; better today than yes
terday? Is the world better than it
was a hundred years ago? The
preacher tells us that the world is
growing better day by day, but I
doubt it very much. “Why” are we
told this?
All my life at every corner and
mile-stone I have faced that little
word “why?” and today my “whys”
are becoming numberless, consequent
ly I am habitually stalled.
A question of moment, yet one
given no thought by many, is the
morality or, to better express it, the
double standard of morals—one for
men, another for women.
An immoral woman’s word goes for
naught—on every hand she finds her
word doubted. “Why?” Public sen
timent says that a woman not moral
can’t be truthful. But—we take a
man’s word for truth no matter how
immoral he may be. No matter how
many crimes he may have committed
we will believe him rather than the
woman who has only made one false
step. “Why?” You can believe an
immoral man or not—there are but
few of the other sort when measured
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
by the standard for women. The man
whose morals are questionable wants
for a wife a pure woman (who can
blame him) and will take no other—
on the other hand the moral woman
would much prefer a good man—but
where is she to find him? (Remem
ber, this is man from the view-point
of woman who is moral.)
“Boys will be boys,” is the usual
reply to any question on the miscon
duct of boys and young men—but if
it happens to be a girl—well, it is
“just because she wanted to.” See?
It is not always “because she wants
too’ sink herself that a girl
or woman becomes a white slave. It
is not always because a woman can
lead (?) a man where she wills that
she falls, for in spite of all that has
been said about a woman’s leading—
man follows not unless he wishes to
do so. Neither is it always the case
that a woman is all bad when she be
comes the plaything of the “Lords of
Creation.” Ah! these mothers whose
girls go astray, do they ever think
that they are teaching their boys just
as some mother taught the boy who
went down with their girls. But you
can’t make some of them believe that
a well dressed man who proposes mar
riage to their girls means anything
but good—you couldn’t convince her
that a house of shame would be her
child’s lot. No, she expects this hu
man vulture to respect purity and
reverence truth.
My God! Every year the Ameri
can motherhood is spending hard
earned wages on preachers and for
eign missions, while a pit deeper than
the proverbial lower regions is en
gulfing their boys and girls. Why
is it that so many girls must be sacri
ficed? It is said for the protection of
all women. “Why?” Hadn’t we bet
ter dispense with such protection and
rely upon a shotgun? Is it the girl
with the pure face and plain clothes
that causes the demand for this hor
rid plan of protection? Or is it the
protected— those who have nothing
more important on hand than dress
ing to attract attention? Is it not the
woman with “puffs” and pompadours,
frills and silk skirts, powdered and
painted face that incites the high, the
low, the common and uncommon man
to deeds more brutal than those of
the Dark Ages? “Backward, turn
backward, O! time in your flight,”
and point out to us the originator of
women going half-dressed, and ex
plain to us if it bears any relation to
the vice and crime of today. Is poor
old Mother Eve responsible for pres
ent day styles? Did woman, with her
lack of the initiative, invent them or
was it a man, and had he counted the
cost?
“What is good?” With a double
standard as to what is right how are
we to know?” To inculcate into the
human mind the principle, the art of
doing right for right’s sake, of being
true for truth’s sake—would it not
be better than this semblance of do
ing good for fear of death, hell and
the grave? ‘GEORGE MARTIN.”

FRESH AIR CAMPS FOR THE
POOR.
green pasture;
He leadeth me beside the still
waters:
He restoreth my soul.”
Three years ago I was placed in
charge of the Army work in this
city. I went to work in the field
with a full determination to ascer
tain the conditions which confronted
us as to the poor, and the best pos
sible methods of extending relief to
that —which we have with us al
ways. The Fresh Air Encampment
for feeble mothers and puny chil
dren presented itself to my mind.
The proposition met with good fa
vor. We launched the first enter
prise of that character in the sum
mer of 1907 —and this year of our
Lord, 1909, witnesses the fruition of
our labors with the best equipped
camp for the poor we have yet had,
and the only institution of its kind
in the Southland.
In our first encampment we gave
an outing to about three hundred
poor mothers and children —and
very infirm and aged men; the sec
ond, which was operated in 1908, we
cared for in the neigborhood of four
hundred. This year we hope to have
with us during the life of the camp
—which will be from July Ist to
about September 15th—more than
five hundred of these women and
children, circumscribed in their op
portunities by the cruel limits of
poverty.
This is a service of great worthi
ness, for it takes work-worn moth
ers and puny children for a delight
ful season away from ill-ventilated
homes; cramped, squalid, wretched
—and carries them to the fresh air
and shade of the woods; away from
the dust, heat, and filth of the city,
and away from quarters where dis
ease lurks and misery reigns, “To lie
down in green pastures,” inhale the
life-giving ozone of the woods, free
from care; to quaff the pure waters

JEFFERSONIAN PATTERN DEPARTMENT
We begin this week a department that we trust will be found espe- :
cially helpful to the home dressmaker, who will find, by following these I
patterns and the simple directions that go with each, that the task of
keeping herself and family neat and becomingly dressed at a very small
tcost is much reduced. Every girl
should be able to make for herself,
at a trifling expense, such a dainty
garment as the shirt-waist herein
pictured (No. 8518).
It will be found excellent for the
separate waist of linen, madras and
pongee, or it may form part of a
costume or panama or the heavy
cotton fabrics. The present devel
opment is white linen trimmed
with heavy lace and insertion. The
closing is on the left side and the
neck is finished by a round Dutch
collar. The one seam sleeve is
laid in groups of tucks alternating
with bands of the insertion. The
pattern is cut in 6 sizes: 32 to 42
inches, bust measure.
Pattern here illustrated will be
mailed to any address on receipt of
10 cents in stamps or silver, ac
companied by plain direction as to
number and size wanted.

earth —plenty of wholesome food;

clean as a pin and as substantial as
houses, and with immaculate equip
ment.
We have applied the appropriate
and suggestive appellation to this
site of “Camp Ozone” —and it bids
fair to be handed down in the charity
annals of the Southland, and it will
no doubt serve as an inspiration and
an impetus to other sections seeking
the best and most wholesome meth
ods for the needy during the sum
mer months.
It seems that this special line of
service has struck the keynote of the
situation; has most certainly sup
plied a long felt and crying need,
and as the visitors go and come from
Camp Ozone, they are unaniomous
in their declarations that something
is being done in these camps the
value of which it would be very dif
ficult to compute; precious lives are
being saved, burdens are being lift
ed from hearts drooping ’neath the
Upas shade of adversity; little

whose sallow cheeks the roses have

hand of nature, and are permitted to
taste of the delights that belong to
childhood and which are denied
them in the cruel sphere in which
they are accustomed to move.
In many cases there is more to be
considered than merely moving these
unfortunates to the camp ground to
enjoy its benefits and pleasures; i. e.,
it often becomes necessary to look
after rents, and adopt means to re
tain quarters for these people while
they are being cared for in our
camps.
“Camp Ozone” is an ideal spot for
the purpose, and nothing has been
left undone which makes for the
