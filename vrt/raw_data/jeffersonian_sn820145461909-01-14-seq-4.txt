PAGE FOUR
AFTER THE QUARREL.
By Charles Hanson Towne.
We leaped upon the battlefield,
And struck our verbal blows,
And neither you nor I would yield,
Once friends, now deadly foes.
We fought the fight, then o’er the
grave
Os that which we had slain
We two clasped hands and strove to
save
Some shred of love —in vain!
For the pale ghost of that we slew
Rose up in all its might;
You killed the faith I had in you,
I lost your trust that night.
And Something stalks between us
now:
I look in your sad eyes,
You see the wound upon my brow —
Poor fools, who once w z ere wise!
—Cosmopolitan.
A LITTLE LESSON.
The head had been removed from
a syrup barrel by the master of the
house, in order that the quantity of
rock candy within might the more
easily be taken out.
Time passed and it became desirable
to use said barrel for the purpose of
hauling water. The “gude mon”
could not be cornered long enough
to replace hoops; so near the close of
a certain day, the mother and I sallied
forth to accomplish said task.
Armed with a variety of tools, we
pried, pushed, squeezed, scuffled and
shuffled, but all in vain; the spread
ing staves refused to unite.
Darkness caused a cessation of he
rics, but the next morning they were
resumed with redoubled vigor. The
program of the evening before was
gone over many times; fingers were
mashed, and stronger things thought
than said, but the cracks grinned just
as broadly and jubilantly as ever.
When one side had been incorporated,
and by dint of force the other side
had almost been persuaded to come
under the hoop, out popped the first.
As a last resort the offending bar
rel was lassoed in the hope of reduc
ing its compass. But the rope seemed
to have about as much binding force
as a hair, so in sheer disgust I de
sisted, and stood sulkily looking down
on the mother, who not knowing what
else to do began driving down a lower
hoop which had also been loosened.
As she worked I noticed that the
staves were drawing together, and
when it was tightened, the first hoop
slipped over with little difficulty.
“Why didn’t we think of that be
fore!” was my contemptuous fling at
our stupidity.
“Live and learn,” said the mother.
But with a memory vision of that
barrel dance, I devoutly hoped every
lesson wouldn’t prove quite so stren
uous.

ON A RAINY AFTERNOON.
By Nellie Burt.
“Pardon me, please, but do you not
care to read.” These words were
spoken by a young man dressed in a
hunting suit of duck to a young lady
on a seat behind him in the railway
car.
There was nothing striking in his
appearance except his large brown
eyes, which beamed with intelligence
and gentleness as he spoke. The lady
to whom the question was addressed
had been gazing out of the car window
for quite a while, and she struck the
young man as being sad and home
sick, and so she was, for she had left
her loved ones that day after a few
days’ vacation to return to college.
As she turned toward him, her
dreaming eyes “seemed where fairy
lakes swam softly to and fro.” Lift
ing a late magazine which lay open on
the seat beside her, she answered in
the softest and most musical tones,
“Thank you, sir, but I have some
thing to read.” Then she turned
her face to the window again and
gazed idly out at the fast falling rain.
She made a very interesting picture,
as she sat there robed in her uniform,
with her college cap sitting jauntily
upon her raven curls. The young,
man, throwing aside his magazine, sat
gazing for one brief moment upon the
picture behind him, and then he spoke
again. “It’s a rainy afternoon,
isn’t it?” Being a modest, con
scientious young woman, she debated
the question, “shall I speak, or shall
I not,” for an instant, but being so
sad and so lonesome, she yielded to
the temptation and murmured to
conscience, “be still.”
Thus they began their conversation,
which lasted for hours.
She found that he knew several of
her best friends at school, and that he
had also been a “college victim.”
Before they had finished the discus
sion of friends, college fares, “cuts,”
and rules, he was wondering to him
self if he should ever see her again
and what her name was, for she had
taken special care to conceal it. When
the big, fat, black porter called out
the of M the young
man’s brow carried aught but a pleas
ant appearance, and he longed in his
heart to knock this intruder into the
“middle of next week.” The eyes
that looked so dreamily into his a
few hours ago now met his very sauci
ly, as much as to say, “it is all over
with you.” After he saw her off the
train, she murmured a short, sweet
message of thanks to the brown
eyed stranger, and gathering up her
skirts in her tiny gloved hands was
soon lost in the crowd.

Two years later, as Jack Lynder
was ushered into an elaborately fur
nished drawing-room by his beloved
cousin and hostess, Mrs. Livingston,
he was almost taken from his feet
with unexpected joy on seeing coming
'Scjfersonian
forward to .meet him the one for
whom he had searched in vain for
two long, weary years.
“This my cousin, Jack Lynder, Nel
lie, dear. Oh! beg your pardon,
Miss Golden,” said the noted Mrs.
Livingston, taking Jack by the arm
and leading him up to Nellie.
“Will you show Cousin Jack
through the conservatory, dear, while
I give a few orders to the servants?”
Dr. and Mrs. Livingston’s conser
vatory was faultlessly arranged, and
one of the most beautiful and famous
in the country. But all of its beauty
w T as lost upon the couple now seated
in a shady, fragrant nook, and whom
fate had destined for each other.
“Nellie, dear, I met you on such
an afternoon as this, and it was then
that I realized the full meaning of the
word love. I loved you at first sight,
and since being here and basking in
your sunny smiles I have learned
that I cannot exist without you. Now,
look into my eyes and say, I love you.
These three little words mean the
world to me, my fair one.”
She must have said them, for on
that very “rainy afternoon,” she
wrote to her mother:
“I have at last found one whom I
love and trust, and one to whom I
have given my word, with your per
mission, to wed next June.”
SOME QUESTIONS WHICH PUZ
ZLE A TEACHER.
Not long since I heard a courage
ous young preacher make an address
on the subject, “Is the Church de
clining?”
He said that the Church is declin
ing—rapidly, sadly declining—in pow
er, in morality, in spirituality; that
it has lost the respect of the world,
and that it is looked upon by the
world as a huge joke; a slam, a pre
tence, that the world, seeing the
Church doing all the things it con
demns the world for doing, and claim
ing to be so much better than any
body else, had quite naturally lost all
confidence in and reverence for the
Church.
He said that the Church is almost
entirely to blame for the state of af
fairs. The main reason for it, he
said, is the disposition of the Church
to eater to the world, to try to make
itself popular with the world, to pa
tronize rich, influential hypocrites.
And he scored the Church for the
way it would hang on to members, es
pecially rich ones, who had been di
vorced and married again.
He said that one cause of the de
cline in the moral standard of the
Church, and of folks generally, is the
literature that is being taught in the
schools —fairy tales, fables, fiction,
etc. —as well as the great amount of
cheap, vicious reading matter with
which the country is flooded.
I spoke to him after his address
and asked him more specifically as to
which of the literature in the text
books he condemned. He said he
would not teach, nor, if he could help
it, allow children to read, anything
that is not, or could not be, true.
I asked him what he would do with
the Uncle Remus stories, for instance,
some of 'which are given in our read
ers, or Hawthorne’s Wonder Stories,
or some of the classical myths.
He said, “I do not like the Uncle
Remus stories at aHI, and if I come
to one when I am teaching I either
pass it by or just say, ‘Children, this
is not true, for animals don’t talk.’ ”
And he said he would do the same
way with every fable, fairy tale or
myth he came to.
He also thought it w z rong to teach
children the happy deceit about'Santa
Claus.
His argument against these things
is that when children read or are
taught that something is true and
then find out that it is not, it has a
tendency to weaken the moral nature
—to break it down, even, in some peo
ple —that they will think, “Well, if
that isn’t true it will be all right for
me to tell something that isn’t true.
The grown folks have told me stories,
so I’ll tell them, too, when I find it
convenient.”
I agreed with him in many things
that he said, and I greatly admired
his courage and honesty, for I saw at
once that when he believed a thing
to be true he would say so, even at
the risk of making himself unpopular.
So many preachers bow to public
opinion, flatter the powers that be,
and lack moral courage enough to
show up the evils that exist in the
Church, until it was refreshing to me
to hear him —not because I wanted
the Church to get a lick, but because
I know the conditions he pointed out
are true, and when we know some
thing is wrong we just as well say so
and go to work to right it. It is al
most impossible to remove an evil so
long as those who are in the best
position to remove it pretend that it
doesn’t exist, and even participate in
it.
I do not, however, quite agree with
the young minister in regard to the
harmful effects of the Uncle Remus
stories, Santa Claus, fairy tales, and
so on.
I know that there is a great amount
of harmful, immoral literature that is
ruining the plastic, impressionable
minds of the many boys and girls who
are eagerly devouring it, but it isn’t
the class of literature mentioned
above.
I am of the opinion that the in
clination in children to tell false
hoods and practice deception is due
to something else besides reading ani
mal stories and fairy tales and be
lieving in Santa Claus. I should like,
however, for some of the Jefferson
ian’s readers to tell us what they
think about it. Would it be best not
to teach anything that is not really
true? /Will not some of you step un
der the Vine and Figtree and give us
your views on this question?
