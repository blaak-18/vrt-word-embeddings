HOME OF SONG.
BY W. C. ....
Spirit of Song,-where is thy Ipmrne
Thy numblers are heartl, whero'the wild
winds roam,
Where the tireless tempests madly sweep,
The bounding wav.es of the rolling. deep.
Spirit of song,-chainless and free,
As the Inountauin waves of the storm
rocked nea,
Borne on t1he oeean's seneless swell,
Is thy home the Nereid'sjewelled shell ?
The flowrets bloom, and the lenaf clad tree.
Are tuned to strains of thy minstrelsy,
When whispering zephyrs, soft. and low,
O'er fl,wer andu tree theirtbreathingblow,
Spirit of nolg; -- dearer to nle,
Than flowret'.s bloom or leaf-clad tree.
In the zen.hyr's wing, y plsc- k of rest t
Thy cherished home th zaephlmr's breast!
The laugmhing brook, as it purls along,
It's pehltled bed, is loind with song;
Gentle and chnlm as love's first dream,
Are the tomes on the waves of the rip
pling st amn .
Spirit of'.smng,-thy Siren lauy,
Flows on the streamllet,-d.mncing away,
Nor Honri harp has a sweeter trill,
Thant the 'tones on the breast of the
purling rill.
There's song in the golen streams of light,
That playovu the sheen of the starry niuht,
For the morining stars together sang,
When the green earth from Chaos sprang,
Spirit of sonug ;-thy hot.e's not here,
Thine is a brighter, purer sphere,
Thy home, thy native home is afar,
Beyond the roll of the bril'htest star.
Away, Away in the spirit-land,
Before the throne where the angels stand,
Where seraph and churb--i sacred choir,
'Triumphant sweep their harps of fire.
Spirit of song; the holy shrine,
Where seraph and churb hymn is thine.
Thy echoes to earth, alone are given,
Thy honie, thy native home, is Heaven.
The Pauwnbroker's Story.
As a Ipawnbroker in a populons sub
urb of Londonl, I have hliad, ccasionl
to see painful, and sollletilles not
ulitpleasing phases of society. Just to
givei an idea of what occasionally
CimUes under the notice of a person
in mny pr4ofe.ssion0, I shall dsecr.ibe a
little incidenlt and its conseq lences.
One evening I 'st'pd to the doior for
a little fresh i air and to look Almoit me
for a momnent. White I was ,gaJzing
uip and down the iiroad, I saw a tidify
diressed young plemitrlll stepi ltl to our
side door. She walked like a lady
and let me tell von tlet in nline eastes
out of ten it's tihe walk, and n,'tthtlle
dress, which distiniguislies the lady
fromt the servant girl-and first site
looked ahout, and then she seemed to
uakile up her mind in a flttried sort of
11 Wa, aniid in a ilonlelt more was I
sttndilig alt Oi1u counter, holding out 4
a glittering soimethiing in a little t
trembling hand coveled with a worn
;id glove. .
I alssistant, Isaac, was stepphig
frlward to take the seal, when I came 1
in and interposed. The'l po'r .youlig
thing was so nervous anld shy, and I
altiither ns unused to this Work, I
that I felt for her as if she had tbee I
imy own dauighter, slhoost. Shite
co"llº.a,'t halve, been a10 eighteen
yelarsa dd-s- frail an glnt.le a creature. I
"If'yon pleqise, will you tell me," I
lsh satid timidly, in ai very sweet, low I
voice, trembling with nIervonness,l
"'what is the value of this seal I"
"Well, Miss,".I said, taking the i
seal into my hand ani hlootllg at it
it was an oldfatshione, d ieal, such ans
country gentlemen used to wear,
with a coat of, daila cat, qpou,it. 4:
"that depends upon liheti, l, yeou
want toi pledge it, or to sell it out- I
right." c
"I am married, sir," mad she lsaid i
the wvords .. proudly and with dig- I
nity,. though still so sahy, and seemingi I.
ready to burst out crying; "and" iiiy
hIluandl is very ill-and--and--."
And thele t'he tears wiibdui't'b:e kept
bark any longer, and' s sl dobbed is t
if her poor little heart wotld:break. I
"There, there, niy dear," .I said, tq
her ; "don't cry ; it will comne al1 right I
in time " aind I tried to conifortl her
in my rough-and-ireadyTay.' "I will
letd yoe,I Illrmif,n" I. tsaid to her at1i
hlaut, !L"a sveriug ll up I thi Real ;:lad
if you wish tos ell;it, perhaps I can
sell it tfor you lto advantage." And
so I gave her a'tioind ; ald shle tip a
ped away with a lighter heart, and
mlany thanks. to Ine, and .I thought
no more of the matter atthe, time. '
The very next day, the day before a
Christmas, there ecane into our place
of business a very eccentrie' gentle- I
mani, who had called upon .us pretty
often before, not for the sal~t of pawn- I
lug anythilg, though lie was general
ly slhabbiy enough to. iAuthe, was a
collector--one of those oten whio ar
maid upon old china and curiosity 'of
all sorts.
'Anything in my way, 'to'dAy,
Mr.: Davis ?" lie said, in his :qaIck,
energetic imanuner, with a jo!lly ' smile
upon his. face, aud putting dowd
the cigarette he was smoking pon
the edge of the eonater. 'TIlls Iv.
Mr. Broadmian is ia collector iif gu:lls~
and rags, and seals, and, in fact, I of
any stolles that have heads or figures
upon them. And I had been in .the
hiildt of pltting aside for iinm Wihlit
ever in thim way lassled throlgh our
ihinds, for hie gave as a better price
than we ihoelld have got for theml ait
the qluarterly sales. "The fiact is,
DIvivi," lie iaidl to mile, "lhese thinligs
lla invalualble; maniy of tlhel are as
leantifll, oil it ilnall sciile, as the iold
Greek scriptnres; and somue of thetn
even by the slanie artists. And they
arelmade no .loger ; for, ii this busy
lineetASIth cenlury of ours, time and
braiis are too prIehsoO to tie lspeit oil
these laborious tritles." Nl.K, al
though l iad noestoick of the kinid lie
wanteid just thelf, it eitteredin'ith aly
iliad tlihat I wouild tell' hhilu alhoiit the
slal which hiaticomle int! lity 'iueasa
sjoti tihe eveiling Iefore.- ,
I told himi the siy tor smlewhatias.
lmivejist told it too. y iid l'istenlled
attlentirely to all I said, Wlhen Iliad
done lhe looked at the seal, and said,
"I observe that it has ietan the liqr.
aldie emblem of a baronet." He
then congratulated me upon the way
in which I had aeted. He asked, too,
for this young lady's address, which
she had given ame quite correct, and
then he left the shop without another
word.
. You must give me leave to tell tlhe
rest of the story in my own way, al
though it- may be a very diiferent
way from that whieh the reverend
personage employed iu relating it to
me. afterward.
It. seemed that it was a runaway
match. A country baronet's 'son hail
fallen ini love with the clergyman's
daughter in the village vwhere his
father lived, and tihey had run sway
togethler and got married. Then they
came up to London, these two poor
young thinglw-fir neither4his, father,
nor lehas either, for the matter of
that, would have anything to say to
the Islatch-he, full of hopes of get
ting on in the literary and artitic
line, and she, poor creature, full of
trust in hinm.
The preoject of living by. literature
did not turn uat ac. was expected. Theli
yonng fellow Without experience o
friends, spent much time in going
about from one publisher to another,
and sending his writings to the va
rious Inagazines-which I need niot
say, were always "returned with
t ranks." And then lie fell ill ;typhus,
I fancy, brought on by insufticient
nourishment, and bad drainage, and
disappointed hopes. The registrar.
general does not give the return of
these cases in any list' thati am aware
of; but we see something of 'them in
our line of business nevertheless.
It was just at this time. that Mr.
Broadman fsund "out Mrs. Vincent,
for that was the name of the young
lady who came to my shop with the
gold seal. Cambridge Terrace is not
very far from the,Angel at Iilingt.nm.
and thllere, in a little back street of
small, respectable ,houses inhabited
by junlllir clerks, with here and thera
a lodging house, Mr. and Mrs. Vin.
cent lived.
They were rather shy at first of a
stranger, and a little proud and
Imhaghty, perhaps. People who have
see bLet ter days anti, are. down upon
tlleir luck, are apt to be so. But the
parson with his pleasant ways and
ch.eery voice. ano0 made it all right;
and, in a jelyf, he and Mr. Vi oceit
were talking about college, for they
Ihad both beeu to the same university.
And there was even eoon'a smile, too
-a wan maile enough-upon the poor
invalids' sharp-eut, thin face, with
theyellow, far away eyes, which look
ed at you as if.out of a cavern. He
was the wreck of a fue young-fellow,
too, oie llho had been used to his
hunting and shooting, and all the
country sports which moake broad
chested, strng-limbed ettumitry Iao.
pie the envy of us poor, thin pale
townlsfolks.
Mr. Brodmaelnr came direct to me
when lie left themi, - I did not live for
off, and le thought that I might lend
themmi a neighblr's help. "Davis,"
says lie, that poor fellow is dying ; I
can see death in his eyes."
"What is lie a-dying of t" I replied.
He looked at me steadfastly a ma
ment, and I could see -a moisture in
his eye, as he said, slowly and solemin
ly, "Of starvation Davis--of actual
want of food."
"'A gentleman starving in London,
in Ilslingtou, a baronet's son, too !
Wlpy it's iucredible."
"Not at all,!' said Mr. Broadman,
"these are the very people who do
die of starvation in Lomdon, and iu
all great cities. Not the poor, who,
klnew where thie work-houIse, and why
ctan get at tihe ielieving otlicer, if the
wost eiones to thei wost ; but the well.
born, wio have fallen into djbstitUte
povert.; audwlho carry tlheir pride
with.i them, dive into a black alley,
like some wl4 anmianal ilto a hole, to
die a nhe.'' Mr. V'incedt wants wines
nlld jellies, and all sorts of goo
thinge;if help Ihasi't come too late.
No,; no, umy friend." lie continued.
puiting back mny hand, for I was reary
to givae my money in a propei eanrss
No, no ; I have left themi all they
wanut at present, Davls. Uit '11 tell
you what yon can do; yne opan if
you like to pay the good Samaritau,
g- and see.them, and cheer them lup
a bit. Mr. VincenUt hliasn't forg~tten
'our rindness to her, I eam assuite
you. Aid I thinlk her huslmand would
like to thank you too, and it woqld
arouse lhii up a bit, perhaps." ACd
then Mr. Broadman told me, short.
Ily,'methltng of hlhit these two pior
thing hald gonIe tlirugh-she, loving
and trusting himt, so; and hIe, half IIIad
that lie had brought her to this pass,
and coeld ,o nothing for her.

low .he was, clean shaved as Ia In,
and wery neat and old-thieh iP
hlis drs, with baSd nt so air aboot
him which marks an English country
'gentlemau wherever lie Dauy be. Well,
we sooti got into a talk, for I'd spot
ted the Baronet in a umoment, and he
was anxious to fild out something
Sashout his son, Its soon as he leard I
knew a little of the young couple.
''"Ad you, do not think, sir, that
my--that Mr. Vinient is dangerously
ill f't said the old lbaronet; and there
I was a sob in his voice as he spoke,
and his hand trembled as he laid It
Iupon nillne,
"Here is lthe house," I 'said, "and
yon will be able to judge for your
self."
We went in., ,At least the baronet
went into the roomu, trembling In
every limb' with the excitement of
seeing his son. ut when lie set eyes
on-.lh.ne altepoor old man was sno
startled that be could scarcely speak.
His son saw him and tried to rise,
hibt fell hack feebly into his chair.
"Dear fathep"' lie mrmnrred, stretch
ing out a thin, trembling bland, "for
give--"
But the father was on his knees by
the chair in a moment, clasping his
son's head in hIia arms, and fondling
him as he had done when the man
was a baby.
"What have I to forgive. You must
forgive me for beinig so hard, m.i- dear
boy, and get better soon, Wilfrod, my
son, my on !"
I had come into the room; I could
not help it, I was so interested and
excited. But I saw that in the young
man's face which made my heart sink
into my bosom like lead.
The young wife saw it too, and
gave one, two, three sharp screams,
as if a knife had been thrust into her
side.
Mr. Broadmen saw it; and quietly
kneeling down, commielnded to God
as well as lie could, for sobbing--the
soul of his setrvant departing this life.
And I-well, why shionuld I lie alsham
ed to confess it . I knelt down.too,
and cried like a child; for the yopng
man had died in his father's arms at
the very moment of recotnciliiatlon.
The New York Sun says of the late
ao-called speech of Grant, at Des
Moines, that it indicates a perverted
moral nature, because it not only con
templates and foretells with coolness,
and withlout anlly sentir.ent of horror,
a bloody war between American citi
zens, growing out of differences in
religion, but it Is calculated to foment
and eneourage, with all the autholity
of the Presidential officee, uech danmn
able animosities. It is not only in
ttnsely wicked, but hostile to the
constitution and to the traditional
policy of the country. No uan u o nu
upright mind and a true American
heart could entertain such ideas or
deliver such a speech.
A very gerteel-ppearing young
man, wearing kid gloves and carry
ing a lithe and flexible walking-stick,
thought lie would have a joke with a
rusty and venerablb farmer oe the
Fair Grounds last Tuesday afternoon.
"Haloh," said the dandy, "are you one
of the judges on bhogs j "Waal, ya;s,
walk right up and let me look at you,"
said the old farmer; .That youth
was soon lost amid. the crowd, and
no other judges on swine. saw him.
The New York Tribune in noticing
that aueb riots as have pfiliete4d )iss.
issippi are unknown in Virginia,
Nort) Caro'in, and several otlher
StteA, says it is' becaus: "these
States are out of tihe htuda of thile

under tlhe plough of the plinter and

Iwenhe into depweratiit. Governor
Anies has sown tlhe wind anld is reap

nail pretty equarlly on tile head.
A reporter being Cnalled to account
for the statement tlhat a certain meet
in'g "''s alargeind respeetabtle one,"'
whel only one otherl pereson Ibesides
hiilself was i present, insisted that his
leport was literally true; for, said he,
"I wasre large and the other man was

"Rents Ilave risen," was the jocose
uerpark of tile astute small boy whlu

Poultry as Egg Producers.
In our article in your January nmun
her we treated on poultry for muarket.
We now desire to offer a few anggen
tious on poultry as egg producers;
and the weans of increasing th ro
e duction, at a season of the yeathen
eggs are scarc. and high. Thlieasn
It and ate of the party will of ceorll
suglgest what soit of a bIildig shall
lhe used. It only beinlg esselntial that
tliere shall be a southern elxposure,

"The roosting places should be a frame
work with slts 2 feet apart, set at
an angle of 4) . degrees. Under this
hishould be a tlooring set at the sille
angle to receWl4iwd cal-ry off the
droppings that they ni not fall onm
those rilosting below. Under this are
.: arranged other frames like flooring
as low as the space will admit. The
- nesaing places should be in the sun if
possible, and kept cleanly. Now tbh
season I generally commence is, ihu
mediately after the loulting in the
Autumn, when I have them housed
every night, allowiug them full lib
erty during the diay-and a vessel of
t mixed grains and seeds constantly ou
. hanld. I give them one weal each day
of Hot fooud; prepared by cookk:;
together small potatoes, turnips,
I meal, refuse meat, and coarse, flour,
i seasoned in the camne manner as for
tihe table. As soon as the weather
becomes cold I give three meals a day
of cooked-hot feed-adding to the
1 ordinary seasoning one dry red pep
per to every twenty fowls, gradually
r increasing to two and even three
peppers for the same number. They
then becuome constant layers, loosing
not mlore than two of three days at
the end of each litter. Care should
tbe used to have a constant supply of
hime alad gravel i also, ashes for dun
ling places; Now there is a little ne
qiel to t this story, and that is fowls
are unfitted as layers another season,
and ';arely survive a second forcing.
I have repeatedly trtied it, and in al
most every case it produces a disease
of the ovary, at wlhieh point mortifi
cation comlmenices, and death ensues
i, less than a week. As there is no
object iu fiorcing after the first of
April, (eggs beiing low), we propose
to kill anid sed these fowls to niar
ket-as they are always fat and pri
ces high mat this seasoIn. We propose
this plan (having tried it satisfactori
ly) on five year old fowls that we in
tend to dispose of, and if the success
of any of your numerous patrons is
equal to iine, they will have no cause
.it r rg ls 6t "kt t i l na o int.

How, to Ship Honey.--Place two
rows of boxes together, with three or
four boxes in eaich row, or enough to
make a fifty-poundi package; then
you can measure and cut two end
pieces of lumber an inch thick, and
long enough to nail on the edge of the
end pieces. Nail a cleat, two by six
iliches long, in the center of each emd
piece, by which to lift the case, aid
then nail it together, placing the
boxes in and tacking a strip one iunc
ivide on the edge of the top and bot
tom, and on the ends of the emd piec
es, letting it project only about half
an inch over thIe honey boxes to hold
themt in place, amd yet not hide the
