"What is the greatest mistake girls
make, in your opinion?" asked little
Miss Debutante.
"Telling their troubles to other girls,"
responded Mrs. Worldlywise promptly.
"Lord help the innocent who does that!
The number of women who cannot
keep a secret is positively appalling.
The shortness of women's friendships
is also appalling. Now, while there are
women who will keep secrets as long
as a friendship lasts, there are prac
tically none who will keep any kind of
a secret after it is all over. Therefore,
when you have confided in a woman,
either don't quarrel with her or else
resign yourself to have your secrets

WHAT WOMEN CAN DO.
Here Are Two Who Have Proper
Physical Development.
Things one woman has done may at
any time be done by another woman.
Think on that pt'oposition. Physical
development is at present neglected
among women to the extent of a posi
tive sin, a sin against their beautiful
bodies. Physical development is what
the sex needs today. How strong and
splendid and able to take care of it.ylf
the feminine body is when properly
trained you may know from the cases
of a little girl and a young woman I
shall tell you of. Their stories will
demonstrate to you what you feel in
your bones already-that the alleged
weakness and cowardice of woman are
not really natural at all, but an arti
ficial growth upon our civilization.
First there is Bertha Eloise Grant.
cow girl of Arizona. It has been said
that no covy oy rough rider in Arizona
is the equal of this fourteen-year-old
girl. That is probably stretching
things, but she is certainly as skillful
and fearless a rider as any man among
the world's leading horse heroes, the
cowboys.
Physically that female child is the
most happy and fortunate who has no
women over her to constantly repress

ever and ever keep nagging her and
telling her little girls must not run,
jump and climb trees or do this, that or
the other because-heaven help us!-it
Isn't "nice" for little girls to do these
things. Oh, the sins mothers and
grandmothers and aunts will have to
answer for because of their stunting
of the physical development of little
girls! They have done it centuries un
.1i the most stupid, helpless, ignorant
human creature in civilization is the
middle aged and elderly woman. Now
let the stunting be stopped for good and
all.
That a splendid physical develop
ment in a woman is entirely compati
ble with purity of thought and modesty
is proved by the brave cow girl, Bertha
Grant. Wherever she is known she is
mentioned in terms of admiration and
respect, yet this girl has been riding
astride in a divided skirt since she was
old enough to sit upon a horse, and she
knows no other way. She says she
does not see how it is possible to sit a
horse any other way than upon the
cross saddle.
'It I were riding in a big city, I
should 0o' it just the same," she says.
"I would imagine I was going to fall
off all the time if I rode a sidesaddle."
"Broncbo buster?' Oh. yes. She has
never yet found the range horse that
she could not master. The cowboys,
whose pet she is, taught her horse
breaking, and now she can do it with
the' best of them. Then, too, her ad
miring, devoted father has been her
constant companion from her child
hood. Thil broncho has a bad name
for stupidity, treachery and obstinacy,
but Bertha Grant says:
"Baonchos are hard to manage, but
after you have them trained they are
nearly as intelligent as a man. Once
they know their master, he can do any.
thing with them."
One hardly knows which to be more
enthiusiastic over, this Arizona girl

and the policeman led him, panting, to

young Pawtucket high school teacher.
Miss Rogers. She is a slender, delicate
looking slip of a girl. The big boys of
the high school had driven away sever
al teachers before her because of unru
liness and disorderly behavior. They
thought to nmake short work of the new
teacher. Led by the captain of the
football team, six fret tall, the fellows
refused to come to recitation. One
slight secret, however, these ungallant
boors did not know. Though little. thl
new teacher is mighty. She is a train

art of self defense at Wellesley col
lege. When the captain of the foot
ball team showed insubordination, it
seemed that a flash of lightning struck
him in the nose. Blood flowed, and the
captain of the football team went down
upon the floor. Next came the next
biggest high school bully who thought
to defy a woman teacher. In the time
of another flash of lightning he lay be

I have observed in the past ten years
a notable change in the appearance of
the girl clerks, stenographers and other
business young women who go to shops
and offices in New York city. The oth
er morning I happened to be in among
a number of them who were waiting
for a train upon the platform of an
elevated station. Almost without ex
ception these fine American girls were
tall, fiat backed and healthy looking,
as though they cared for their bodies
in the right way-by baths, wholesome
food and plenty of air and exercise.
What is more, their dress was beauti
fully appropriate to their duties. There
was not one of those dirty, trailing
skirts among them that I could see. In
gowns, of black, dark gray or blue
woolen fabric, with skirts of conven
ient walking length, plain hats that
could defy weather on occasion, they
looked the model business woman type
all over. Their faces were bright, in
telligent and many of them handsome,
but there was none of that coquettish
rolling of eyes and flipflapping of body
that girls who used to go to business
half to catch a husband adopted. Now
the brave American girl knows her
place in the business world and has
settled into it. Coquettish and fond of
man's admiation she may be, for that
is natural, but this part of her mani
festation she-saves for her life outside
of office.

Miss Edith Griswold, the New York

A spinster slept alone in-oneiwing of
a large house and felt timid about it.
A married woman jeered at her for be

scared," retorted the lone woman.
"You've got a man and a pistol in your
end of the house." Now, the man was
a little bit of a chap, and he was not
always to be depended on, for some
times he was drunk. Besides that, the
pistol was not loaded, though the man
was at times. Nevertheless here were
a man and a pistol, and the spinster
thought a woman with these near her
had no business, to be frightened.
Women, whatever you do, don't quar

don't get jealous of one another's ad
