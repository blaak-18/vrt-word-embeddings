Government Aid to Southern ~(
Adventurers. Bi
of
Under this caption, the «atLion, one th
of the ablest publications in the coun: th
try, contains an elaborate and well
) considered atticle, from which we th
make the following extracts, which ril
have a peculiar bearing upon our al- ar
fairs in Louisiana: ot
The fearful and alarming condition al
of the South, brought about by the th
'power of the Federal Government, tl
'p that has been used to place and main- in
"' tain in office corrupt adventurers and
ignorant negroes, is arousing the at- Ri
tention of the intelligent and patriot- to
ic class of the Northern people. la
Scarcely a day passes but what v.
some Northe.in Journal, and not un- B
frequently Republican in politics,
contains a scathing rebuke to the Ad
mninistration and a wholesome admo
ns, nition against any farther encroach- so
ments upon the rights and liberties of fa
the Southern people. Carpet-bag and S
- negro rule have done its work sue
cessfully, and its fruits are seen and y
its blighting effects felt all over the
nation. But it has well nigh run its
course, and if heretofore we have
been powerless to check its progress ; ci
now with the powerful aid and co- v
operation of the Northern people and d
press, its complete annihilation may g
now be regared a foregone conclusion. n
says the Nation ; h
After all that has happened during v
the last Yire years, it Inust be admit
ted that it is a little unsafe to specu- p
late as to what course the President 8
will pursue on any question, but the t
signs that he has seen the error of his I
ways in the matter of nieddlingat F
the South are certainly* unusually i
strong. He took a long time to dis- t
charge the duty imposed on him by i
the Constitution and the laws of de- c
.c ciding who was Governor of Arkan. r
sis ; but the decision, when it came, a
had the great merit of being sound
and carefully considered, and, there- t
fore, likely to make a complete end- t
ing of strife. It has one other merit,
,) which is, perhaps, even greater, viz.
that of having been made in com rn
er* Iplete disregard of the notorious per.
fter sons who do duty in Washington as
Senators from Arkansas. This strikes
Sat thie root of the evil of recent Fede
ral interference. It was the prece
dent set in Louisiana which really
brought about the Arkansas trouble,
because they seemed to create a sys
ess tem of government which promised
on as many rewards to intrigue and vio
lence in this country as in Guatema
la or Costa Rica. Indeed, in seqme
respects the position of the Southern
States of the Union since reconstruc.
tion has been worse than that of any
South American State. In the most
poorly governed community of that
region, or of any other, it is always
open to the men of intelligence and
thrift ind prosperity to deliver them
selves from the rule of ignorance and
corruption by an appeal to arms, or,
in other words, by a resort to the
time honored remedy of revolution.
In the worst ages, and under the worst
rulers, the oppressed and plundered
have usually found some consolation
Si the consciousness that if the yoke
became unbearable, a nnion among
the braver better educated, and hon
ester elements of society might by
Sforce bring about reform. If, they
said to themselves, it should really
prove impossible to put an end to
ing these infamies by peaceable means,
we have such an advantage over the
rascals in capacity, in power of com
Sbination, and Command of money or
other resources of civilization, that
we can, if we must, rise on them, and
kill them or drive themn out of the
*.U country. Moreover, the rascals have
d all usually been sufficiently conscious of
bl, all this to be restrained by it in some
e. degree. Their rule has never lasted
very long in any civilized country
without stimukiting the sense of or- and
der into such activity as to create a sere
power sulfficient to furnish security Kin
for life and property ; so that it may it is
be almhnost laid as a rule that the ma
jority never continues to govern for N
any great length of time unless it 'Thi
represents, at least in a rough way, wh:
the intelligence and accumulations of cOU
the community. inll
What has been most deploreble in v,,,,
the condition of the Southern States 1pt
since the war is, that we have under- as -
taken to prevent the natural remedy the
for their disorders f'omii being applied. and
We have set up in South Carolina, con
for instance, a system of government gu
which converts the majority into a pro
gang of robbers making war on civil- dul
ization and morality, and have pledg- hai
ed ourselves to prevent the minority out
from resisting or overthrowing them. cor
We venture to say that no parallel cog
for such a state of things is to be sq1
found in history. A power which un- am
dertakes to prevent rebellion has al- pr
ways-we believe there is no excep- Cal
tion,to this rule-hitherto undertaken we
to supply protection against predato- ear
ry leglslation on the part of the mna. i
jority as well as against open violence. anU
If there was any oppression to be fy
done, it had always done itself, and en,
the very strength which has enabled w
it to oppress, has usually prevented uij
the oppression from being wholly un- del
- bearable. But in South Carolina and ret
Louisiana we tlnd governments, which an
have not strength enough to exist for o(u
ten days, if left alone, perpetrating I
enormities on which the Czar would NC
not venture towards Poland, or the all
British Empire towards the Santals thi
of the Indian jungles, simply because no
they have the United States behind vi(
them guaranteeing their existence.

e, as his words, it would take a man
d three months to walk around one of

d- tract to listen as long as hie would
it, talk, that audience would die of old a

Go ernor Saflbrd, of Arizona says
that ''geitlleomanly far'mers, who com
rmence without means and have hired
all their work done, will undoubted
13'y be obliged to quit the ibusiness;
and those who have invested the
largest portion of their crops in poor
whiskey at twenty-five cents per glass
will hardly be able to meet their ob
ligations and inspire sufficient con
deuce to obtain credit in the future."
A Cnw.AP CIsmoON.--"One who has
t·ricd it" writes as fcllows to the
Americaa 'Farm Journal : "If any
jarmer wants a convenient and cheap
.shion to ride on, let imn take a
i s kin as soon as it is taken front
th ejp, and serape the flesh off,

"The part of the holding '4a farm
er or or landowner which Ipays, for
cultivation," saiud Charles IJ,1el
"is the small estate within thl' "e'
fence of his skull. Let him bJg
with the tillage of his brains, and t.
shall be well with his grains, roots;
herbage and forage, sheep and cattle
-they shall thrive, and he shall
thrive." It is plaiuly the duty of
farmers to olbtairn a practical educa
tion, as well as merchants. Cultiva
ted brains are a crop that never fails.
It is a settled fact that a thorough
business training is essential to suc
cess in any departments of usefulness.
1 THE FARMERS' MOVEIEMNT--IIo
IT IS PROGRtESSIXI.-Let the politi
cians say what they pleask about it
the farners' movement ia going ahead
I like a prarie on fire out West, wheth
r er the organizations in the East be
' sham or not. Several representative
r Missouri papers at hand speak the
3 sentiment of that region. One says :
1 "The necessity for that reform in
1 political administration which the
v united efforts of the farmers of the
a country, especially of the West, can
- alone obtain is so urgent that it can
- I nt (m1 to be recognuied by even the
e most superficial." Another : "This
e movement of the agricultural inter
ests of the country bha not commen
Sced a bit too sooi, ands however mod
est and timid way be their first ac
n tion, they will soon fuind themselves
n caught ip in the whirling tide of State
Sand national political politics, and
e will be compelled, whether they wish
e it or not, to consider all the grave
t problems now before, the country."
n Still another-"The harmers' war, as
n it is sometimes called, is destined to
y have great political influence." A
1- Nebraska paper asserts that the gran
i- gers are making rapid progress in that
r, State. Common cause is there taker
u with the farmers of Iowa, Illinoies
M- issouri. Minnesota and other States
on all questions affecting the farmers'
f irlterests. Another Western paper
n declares that "the whole race of dis
- honest politieans stands in awe of
. this great movement," which is no
rs doubt the truth. A St. Paul paper
1, says it now looks if the "potato hugs"
(grangers) will prove a lively crowd
in Minnesota. Anir Illinois paper de
clares "the movement to be an inde
pendent one commnitted to no one amn
Sto no party, but eolmnending itself to
r all." The Catholic farmers of Olm.
re stead county, MInniesota, although
nt not members of tlie Older of the
e, Patrons of Ilusbandry, express them
a selves warmly in favor of its Iprinci
n ples, excepting its secrecy. In short,
'e there seems, to be a general stampede
or out WVest in favor of the miovement,
" regardless of religious predilections
or previous political afliations.-N.

th A N4EW REMEDr FOR WORMs.--We
nt of course, mean cotton worms, as this
in- in Iot our patent medlicine column,
xe Thie Picayune gives an account of a
vs, very simple andiunexpenstive process
ect by ~bhieh a planter of St, Landry
a parish last year saved hris cotton crop
if' tromr the depredations of the worm.
>. Thre process is based upon the fact
his tlat at a certain stage of his career
to the wormu lies helplessly tpon trhe
io- foliage of the plant, not asufficiently
the developed to hIrave power of motion,
ill) and, in fact, passing through a transi
of tion which, it' interrupted, he cannot
rn of his own resources, manage to corm
g? plete. The plan of the St. Landry
at. ulan is lagiven as follows: le took a
red pair of swamp wheels which were ly
ind irg in hiis stable yard, suspended from
e a thire axel thereof a swinging rake with
oy- long teeth, say four inches apart, so
ug- adjusted as to brush the foliage of the
,os- plant very briskly and then, harness
w ing a pail of mules to those wheels,
lhe proceeded to run over his crop at
tihe rate of about fifteen acres a day.
Having only forty acres, hIre accom
e plished this object in three days.
e to T'he plan worked handsomely.
iho Thousands of worms lay upon the
ground, where they died. The pro
cess w'as repeated twice afterward, at
such intervals as seemed necessary;
the and the planter found his crop entire
