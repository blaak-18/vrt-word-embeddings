Railroad.
The excitement of our people in
relation to the early completion of a
road between this point and Alexan
dria at present, and New Orleans at
no future day, still continues unaba
ted; each and every stranger who
arrives in our quiet city is taken for
a "railroad man" and interviewed to
his hearts content.
We like this spirit because it shows
a manifest interest is being taken
with relation to so great an enter
prise; an enterprise which is destin
ed to build up our valley and devel
op the material resources of our
State from one end to another. For
this reason, too great an interest can
not be shown.
Mr. E. B. Wheelock, President of
the road, is a gentleman well known
to our business community as one of
the leading Drug Merchants of the
South, and thoroughly identified with
the business interest of this State.
Tlie Company, it is proposed, shall
consist of the citizens of Louisiana
only, and the road is to be construct.
ed on the co-operative plan, as the i
paying Georgia railroads were. As
sistance is expected, of course, from 1
the citizens, cities and parishes along
the proposed route, which will be up
the Red River Valley, and we opine
at'sf h 'tfltti meadis will allow. -
It is useless for some to argue that I
the road will not benefit the country t
or this town ; that has been amply
demonstrated hundreds of times al
ready in the great improvement of
all countries ; all villages and cities
which have had railroads constructed
through them. The city of Natchi- 1
tochles has not assumed its present i
business proportions, small it is true t
at this moment, to what it has been, t
through any means save that of the I
agricultural development of the sur
rounding country. The value of pro t
perty in town keeps "even tenor"
with that of the value of lands in the I
parish, let there be a depreciation in
price of planting lands, and city pro- t
perty feels the effect, and then the I
town depends alone upon the country 4
for trade, which is its support, and
the countty not upon the town.
What has led to the present con
dition of our parish is too well known
to refer to here. Suffice it to be known I
that it is so, and our duty is to build
it up again; to bring it back, by I
encouraging public improvements, t
prominent among which are railroads,
to what it once was.
Assuming that this town depends
upon the surrounding, country for ,
support, and that support has fallen
off immeasurably, it become us to do.
all we can to bring more population I
here; more intelligent farmers to im
prove and cultivate the thousands of
acresi of fine alluvial lands along the
led, Litle, and other rivers of rbu
parish, now lying idle, or worked at
by thriftless people. Railroads are
the great drains wvhich draw off from
the thick populations of countries of
worn out lands, vast numbers of im
migrants in all conditions of life,
searching homes where their labor I
will be repaid. Natchitoches parish
can fornish farms for thousands, and 1
each one of them that comes increas- i
es the trade of our city so much, ad
vancing thereby the value of our pro
perty, both of town and country, and I
giving renewed activity and life to all 1
branches of business. In fact the,
benefits to be derived from this rail
road to our parish is incalculable, and I
each enhancement of values through- I
out the parish will be felt. in the city
correspondingly. The pro and con !
arguments used aboat the advance-i
ment of this city are futile, build up
the parish, and the future of Natchi
toches as the centre of a heavy local I
trade, is beyond peradventure.
Oar land owners are, or should be, I
more than anxious to forward this l
enterprise. All capital has its starting i
'point in the soil, it is the lever that I
moves the commercial world, if our
crops fail, all fails.
At a time when men could afford
it, it was well enough to own barouial
estates, but the war has changed all I
that. The labor cannot be depended I
upon to that extent as when in a state
of slavery, even large farms with in- i
telligent white labor has been demon
strated ib the West to be failures. I
These surplus lands our citizens are
anxious to sell, there is no market I
and their value is nominal; but build I
this road, and in favoring it you but
otudy your own interest, and you are
imrmediately on the line ot the flow
of immigration; your lands come, In
demand and a value is at once fixed.
Some may say, "but we don't want to
sell"'f Grsating that, Why do you
kIdp anything to leave as an inheri
tauce to youear children that is of no
praetieal value, when you admit that
with a railroad, your lands and
homPes would be worth something.
Youa hare for instance, a thousand or
two .thousand acres worth, we will
say, S5 per acre now; when thim road
comes it will t'o worth $20, or even
$,0, are you not increasing the to
heiitance for your children 3, 5, or 2
headred per cent, at an investment of
abthing in omparlisa'to the enhane
i'dVals 6f yoUr property. We con
raLl tle .objwtions, as the ar
tsof the "coatrmrles, bat
I.twaltsto combat them for the
Orleans and Pacific rend.
It is proposed to hold a meeting of
our citizens in this city on Monday
next, at which time the plan to raise
the means to construct tile railroad
will be fully developed, and all in
formation desired will be given.
We have had many talks of, and
about railroads as we well rememnber,
for over twenty years, but it must be,
distinctly borne in mind that Mr.
Wheelock and the gentlemen con
nected with him in this enterprise are
well known and influential citizens of
our Capitol; have their all at stake in
its material advancement and that of
the State, they mean business eertain,
and are determined to build the road
from Alexandria to this point, imme
diately.
We hope to see a large number of
our people hero upon the day propos
ed, and such a spirit manifested as
the present exigencies of our de
plorablo condition imperatively de
mands.
The city of Natchitoches possesses
advantages of no ordinary character
in the way of a central business lo
cation, and a commanding situation
for a fine, large, local trade. Sur
rounding us on all sides are the finest
and most desirable lands in the world
Nature has showered her _blessings
now desire to make us a prosperous
business little city, is easy and quick
transit to the markets.
The population of the parish ag
grigates 18,265, according to the cen
sus of 1870, and the arei of her ter
ritory is 362,162 acres, of that,
more than 150,000 acres of arable
land, thousands of acres of which are
now cleared and have been in cultiva
tion, are lying untilled. To add to
the prosperity of the city permanent
ly, these lands must be settled up, as
other countries have been, by invi
ting and holding out sufficient in
ducement to immigrants of the proper
kind. It will only require a little ex
ertion to accomplish this; balf the
talk expended on our streets, apd very
little money, would accomplUh t,e
desired end. 'r
When we are offered such air op
portunity to build us up as is held
out by the New Orleans Pacific Rail
road, we should not neglect it.
Bear in mind that Natchitoches, as a
city, must depend upon its local trade
for life and activity, and with all
the natural advantages we possess,
the jewel of prosperity is within our
grasp if we but profit by the occasion.
Take the "tide at its flood" and it
will lead to prosperity.
It will be seen from our telegraphic
summary, that Clinton has resigned,
and in accepting the resignation, Kel
logg "damns him with faint praise,"
as it were. Generally speaking, a
Certiflnrte at th,is t-.kinl attashoo to
the acceptance of a resignation of
an offlicial by a Governor, was regard.
ed as a high commendation; but, that
"was before the war." Kellogg's
"Cards of Honor" don't. pass in good
circles, that we know of, and most
persons would rather be kicked from
office by a decent man, than politely
bowed out by such an unmittigated
cuas as Kellogg.
Col. E. C. Davidson, of Sabine,
formerly member of Congress from
this District, visited our sanctuam
last Monday. Tihe Colonel is on his
•ay to Portland, Maine, to spend the
summer. He is looking as hale and
hearty as ever, and is still the same
sound, enthusiastic white man's Dem
ocrat, as of yore. We wish the Colo
nel a pleasant Summer, and a safe re
turn to his people.
Much complaint has been made us
of the manner in which the Census is
being taken, and we learn that whole
neighborhoods of our white citizens
have never seen the Census taker,
or any one representing him. As we
do not desire to be considered obtrua
sive or as making this as a sensation
al article, we state the neighborhoods:
Ward 3, right bank ascending. Ward
5. Ward 6, the greater part of 7 and
8, and many persons in town, and in
the.country of other wards.
Although this law, like all other
radical enactments, is unsatisfactory
on all points, save that of compensa
tion, we think the census taker
should visit the domicil of each citi
sen of the parish, and he would there
by arrive at a correct enomeration
of the population; otherwise the cen
sus is a farce.

sues returns with tile following re

MaEj. Green the Engineer in Chief
of the New Oleans and Pacific R. R.
Co., gives us some insight into the
proposed route of the road from Alex
an.lria to thisplace. The road will
Come directly up Red River to Cotile
and cross Caneriver first, about a mile
and one half above its mouth and fol
low the island route to this place. It
is claimed that this is the cheapest,
nearest and best route to construct
the road along.
Our friends in Winn, Grant, Sabine
and Natchitoches parishes, as well as
Sabine and San Augustine counties,
Texas, should not forget that we will
give them through the Vindicator,
news per telegraph thirty bours earli
er than any paper in north Louisiana.
We hope to see our subscrigtion list
increased largely in consequence.

A special dispatch to the Memphis
Appeal says that the democratic con
vention for tihe First Mississippi Dis
trict met at Corinth, Miss., on tihe
21st, and renominated L. Q. C. Lamar
by acclaniation as their candidate for
Congress. Fully five thousand per
sons were present. Mr. Lamar res
ponded in an eloquent speech, after
which the following resolution was
ananimously adopted :
Resolved, That we are opposed to
the formation of parties among the
people of this State, founded on the
difference of race or color, and we
cordially invoke the union of good
citizens of every race and color in
patriotic efforts to defeat, at the next
election, the present State adminis
tration and its supporters, and to soee
cure for all the blessings of an honest
and capable government.
Of course the people of each and
every State know their own business
best, but we say that the white peo
ple of Mississippi are pone higher
than a kite. They can no more carry
the State against the negro combina
tion, for such is the ease, as the ne
groes will nominate candidates for
Congress in all the Districts of the
State save one, Lamar's, than they
can fly.
It is a strange thing to us how men,
claiming to be sensible, blindly atuom
ble along, and with beef and "chin
music," big Democratic banners and
such clap trap, expect to carrysa State
where they have been beaten time
a.sd again in the same manner. If
Mississippi is lost it will be by her
own people, and we shall not sympa
thise with her.
* We want Democracy in these noe
gro State's 'it is true, but color line
Democracy and none other.
A friend of ours and an enthusiast
on home manufacture and home pat
ronage, asked one of our wage how
they made the holes for the telegraph
posts; "make 'em," says hie, "why
they get them from New Orleans
ready made by the sack" "Yese,
d-d 'em," says our friend, that's al.
wrays the way, go off North. and get
things that can be done at home
cheaper." The joke is, our friend
was in dead earnest.

You neglected to remit us the money
for the same, and they are still charg- in
ed to you on our books. The five
tickets sent to you were numbered
from 3470)6 to 337311, and one of the ti
above tickets has been awarded a wI
Svaluable Gift. I am directed by the Ti
officers of the Association to notify no
you of this fact, and to request you ch
to remit to us the sum of two dollars th

ef ADVICE FOR DULL TIMES.-Adver- U
R. tising is a great bother. It only
Ise brings a lot offolksto your place of
x- business. If they want you let them
hunt you up. Then if you get your n
ill name in the paper you will be bored
le with drummers, and people from the
ile country will call on you and you will P
.1- have to show them goods, and like o
enough have to do up buddies for b
them, which will exhaust your stock I
it, so much that you will be obliged to
et buy more goods, which is a great
trouble. If you advertise, too, it b
gives your place a reputation abroad; t
folks will go there and crowd you, i
Be and make it too lively. If you don't
as want to do anything, keep as still as
es, you can.--N. Y. Com'l Advertiser.
ill We refer our business community f
)r, to the above and would beg them to
li- act accordingly. Now that we are to c
ia. have a railroad sure, they will, of I
ist course, want no business as it may be
too much trouble to handle goods,
'es wait on customers or take in money, i
nt even. Who will be the first to indulge
of in the great bother of advertising. t
we are told that , cain Maareehanl
is of France was always taken in con- I
i- vulsions at the sight of a sucking pig;
that Tycho Brahe swooned at the
ar very gliose of a hare; and that the I

n ing from a cock ; but the concentra- I
Sted force of all these phenomena
would scarcely produce a shock tol
to the nerves of the denizens of the
l Vindicator office (to say nothing of
, the ten line puff we'd get up) by the
ed sight of a present of peaches or water- i
i melons from our country friends. I
Wt We hope no one will take offence at

rest assured.

s Parties lately returned from New
,o- Orleans, report that city quite enthu
ier siastic over our railroad, and predict
rry its completion in November.
a. Tfe Bulletin of the 22d, speaks in
ie- no flattering terms of the smallness
for of the subsecriptions of the leading
the business men, and says, but $168,000
tey has as yet been subscribed.
New Orleans must do better than
n, that, else the railroad is a failure.
m. Country parishes cannot be asked to
him subscribe a eent in the face of the

Hereafter boata of the New Orleans

', We thought that puffs were mutual,
Xll that is, bringing benefit to each par
ty, the puffer and the puffed-but the a
puffed thought Ire would deceive the
puffer. A certain telegraph man
laughed at how he had "got" the t
as "newspaper man." Now we "news

will in the end surely find out if re

or not. C
of The manager, Mr. Davis, of the r

or ny, has seen fit, to say things about, f
e and derogatory to the standing of this
'ill paper, and, although his intormation
ke of the person who conducts it, may h
for be a "shaddow 'of reality," it is no v
ck fault of ours. We applied to Mr. a
at Davis for Press Dispatches, weekly, fI
it he seemed anxious we should take
d; them, and upon his departure we
n, learn that from $30 to $50 per month ii
as is as cheap as he can send them, "it
made no difference, we would not pay
ity for them anyhow."
