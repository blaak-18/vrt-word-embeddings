Building on the Sand.
'Tis well to woo, 'tis well to wed,
For so the world hath done
Since myrtless grew, and roses blow,
And morning brought the stun.
But have a care, ye young antd fair,
Be sure you pledge in truth;
Be certain that your love will wear
Beyond the days of youth !
For if ye give not heart for heart,
As well as hand for hand,
You'll tind you've played the unwise part,
And "built upon the sand."
'Tis well to save, 'tis well to have
A goodly store of gold,
And hold enough of shining stuff,
For charity is cold,
But place not all your hopes and trust
In what the deep mine brings;
We cannot live on yellow dust
Unmixed n itL4 purer things;
And hIte o ohn u:i up. wealth alone,
Will often have to stand
Beside the cotfee chest; san own
'Tis "Built upon the sand."
'Tie good to speak in friendly guise
And soothe where'er we can !
Fair speech should bind the human mind
And love link man to mlan,
But stop iot at the gentle words ;
Let deeds with language dwell;
The one who pities starving birds
Should scatter crumbs as well.
The mercy that is warm and true
Must lend a helping hand,
For those that talk, yet fail to do,
rut "Build upon the sand."
Early Training of Children. it1
It will be of a great advantage to "m
children it they are early induced to StA
put forth their powers, to resort first
to the resources within themselves, e
aind, as far as possible, to obtain their in
objects by their own exertions. Such Pe'
an exercise strengthens the faculties,
and giadnally prepares a child for ac- at
ting alone; whilst the habit of having wi
every thing done for him, of depend- sat
ing upon others for his enjoyment, tilt
enervates the mind, and has a ten
dency to weaken the active powers. COt
The "I can't," with which children sat
are apt to reply to the commands let
given them, is rarely to be omitted. By
"I can't" is to often brought forward c'
nierely as an excuse for indolence, or
an apology for disobedience. Our be
pupils must learn that success de- Su
pends upon resolute exertion; and
that, under certain lihmitations, it is a ce;
thruth, that man can do what lihe
chooses to do. This conviction, adopt
ed as a practicle princeple, will be hI'
powerful in its effects ; and will ma
terially contribute to improve the ex
capacities and augment the useful- Pa
ness of any charac;er. Children will rei
act of their own accold with pru- to'
deuce very much in proportion as we pe
lead them to do so; we must mani- ha
fest our confidence in them, if we In
would render them worthy of it. Op
Where can we find a being more help c
less, more uno.blJ to contrive for him- Co
self, to guard against danger, or to ce
escape from it, when it comes upon an
him, than a child who has been tit
brought up by his mother's or his
nurse's side, looking to her for every
enjoyment, and feeling his safety to k'
be wholly dependent on her care 01
On tihe other hand, it may excite sur
prise to observe how much good sense
and self-possession children will dis- 1h
play when early accustomed to de- p1
pend upon themselves. This object, "
like every other connected with edu- Pi
cation, is not to be attained by great in
efforts, hut gradually, and by gentle '
measures. We are not to impose Sc
upon children that which is beyond at
their strength or skill; but we may at
lead them to take pleasure in accoma. no
plishing their objects without assis- I
tance ; to feel it a point of honor to el
pursue them, notwithstanding some cm
difficulties; to extricate themselves f
to submit to trouble, and surmount i
obstacles. As it is by the "neglect g!
of beginning" that bad habits are si
contracted, we should not overlook 01
even those minor occurrences of life
which early affords opportunities for h
inculcating a sjlirit of iudependence. hi
It not unfrequently happens that t
mothers and nurses are pleased by it
the unqualified dependence of those "
under their care ; and, for self-grati
fication, encourage the habit at the e
expense of their influence, and secnre
a selfish affection by rendering their
darlings he plea ', and by fostering 1
their babyish habits. Butit is to be b
remembered that general indepen
dence and vigor of character are per
fectly compatible with the depen- r
dence of affection. This, indeed, is
an object of first-rate importance, and
must necessarily spring out of that
tenderest connection-the connection
between a mother and her children; t
it must be the result of those iname
rable kindness, of that flow of love
anmd sympathy, with an affectionate
d and judicious mother cannot but uni
,. formly display towards her children. I
Such a mother has no occasion to nur
ic ture the infirmities of her children,
that she may strengthen their affec
.- tion. It is to be desired that children
should possess the greatest tender
ness towards a mother, an enjoyment
and delight in her society, a rever
ence for her opinions, and submission
to her authority, combined witlh pow
er to act alone, and to pursue their
independent objects with vigor and
. pleasure; for it is necessary to all
Sthat they should mingle strength
with affeetion; tlhat they should be
manly as well as tender, and be train
ed to help as well as to be helped.
The proverb says, "Laugh and
a grow fat." What a saving of corn it
t would be if our pigs could laugh.

Worth Noticing.
We clip the following extract from TI
a Washington letter to the Cincinnati cr al
Cormmercial, dated May 10th, 1876(. Ir'i
Without my knowledge of the truth
of the article, we publish it as a pos- joy a
sible explanation of the cause whichr tils i
led to the shooting of Senator Twit
chell. If true it will serve to rob the tion.
affair of that political significance Of
which the Radical journals have so cal
persistently endeavored to attach to 1iiEn
it, and will place an entirely new Thei
phase upon the matter : iIal
Twitchell has long been a zealous invil
member of the unscrupulous Packard- sic t
Durell-Kellogg ring, who have ruled Iictl
the State with inexorable tyranny in blen
their own ssea.b .ierests. 1ie put the
t,1e Conshatta mhassacre ln turer i, ,in,
secure his own re-election. The max- 01111
sacre came off as lie had arranged (lie trus
was conveniently leagues away at the TI
time), but miscarried in a few un-. ay,
important details, and his brother "Ev
was killed on account of the nliscar- you
riage. But he was re-elected-as the writ
riot which lie had instigated demon- 011
strated the necessity of sending U. roof
S. sohliers into the parish to intimi- ties
date the white voters. His ciremn- stori
stances were similar to those of Gov. eaclh
Ames, of Mississippi. when that ster- liii
ling patriot was led to remark that they
it would be necessary "to have a few teii
niggers killed" in order to carry the que.
State for his party. sue,
Twitclell, like all the ring to which heat
he belonged, was extremely zealous and
in his own personal behalf in all res and
pects-and particularly careful to hoiw
lose no oppiortunity to enrich himself the
at the expense of the people, over life,
whom ihe was a tyrannical ruler-as a duc
sample incident will show. While in cult
the Legislature, some years ago, at a how
time when his crowd had complete port
control of affairs, lie secured the pas
sage of a bill regulating the sale of hole
real property in default for taxes. inlt
By the terms of the law real estate ctii
could be sold, after advertisement, g.irl
for taxes, and the purchaser would otln
be given a fee simple title by, the els
State. E
The provision regulating the ad. yeal
vertising was very loose, so that dem
Twitchel was enabled to carry out wlhl
his little pian for which alone the to n
law was devised. You are aware uplo
that the taxes in Louisiana have been unti
excessively high. In Natchitoches to t
parish, for instance, when the tax on tllei
real property-pltantations well - as gett
town property-was redutcel to eight met
per cent. the people felt that they her,
had special cause for thankfulness. thai
In News Orleans the assessors who tem
appraised property- were paid a per forl
centage on their appraisement, and imy
consequently property showed up ex- ove
ceedingly valuable on their tax lists, des
and the taxpayers had to pay on fic- mli
titious valuations. fort
Whether this was the case or not in lai
the country I don't know, but I do the
know that if taxes ever got so high in 'I
Ohio the people of that conservative tih
old State will incontinently rebel, and Iitl
serve them right, too. Twitchell had rea
long had his eye of desire upon a fine for
plantation in his neighborhood, but ind
was unable to secure the coveted wO
prize until his wit suggested the law to
mentioned. The plantation in de to I
fault on account of State taxes. He to
secured the order for its sale, had the to
advertisement placed in a most ob- gel
scure corner ofa more obscure countryv als
newspaper, where lie was sure it un
would never meet the eye of the own
er of the plantation ; the day of sale wi
came, and the proprietor was dumb- "
founded when the property passed he
into tlhe hands of Twitchliell, ithh a tho
guarantee title from the State for ltu
simply the amount of the arrearages ti
of taxes. oft
This is only a sample of the many ha
acts of hIigh-hlanded outrages that ny
have characterised the rule of the ring ed
that has prevailed for so many years sol
in Louisiana. The recital of thein all an
would occupy days nod pages, but w
.thle list would be only of cumulative g
, ovidence.
B1 ------**------ * Ith
Sithe parishes that have been created to
J in this State since reconstraction, d4
have been the cause of more disturb- as
ances and lawlessness than any other at
one thing that we now recall. The as
reason of this is very manifest. In lI
the first place, thie people who pay
the taxes in these new parishes, were
t never in favor of them. They were w
Screated solely in the interest and for0 h
Sthe benefit of a few office holders. rr
The people were never consulted, or tI
O their interests regarded. Any sen- al
e sible man could have foretold the tl
' dreadful evils that have followed this t
* legislating to create new oflices. Look al
r at Grant and Red River parishes. i
' Read the bloody records of tlhese new I
- parishes, and then defend, if you can,
' the authors of the plundering schemes i
r- that have made tlhese outrages pos
it sable, if not inevitable. There have t
r- been at least two hundred murders b
in in the parishes of Red River and Grant
" since their organization. Would these

"Every home is a happy one until biscui

writer in the olden time, and gr'iev- oil tt
oils it is that the peaceful-locking )peti
roofs so frequently cover dishartt-i. deep

each member of the household has Api

Every vocation in life requires of pa

demands a life study. But a woman three
whose mission and whose work it is dinni
to make the home, too often enters all v
upon her duties wholly unfitted and nOUn
unprepared, having given no thought Hl
to the weight her influence will have spool
there. Site neglects her mind, for- ham,
getting that tihe impetus to improve- and i
meat and culture must emanate from over
her. She neglects her body, forgetful miit,
that good health alone begets good or on
temper. She neglects her manners, in bt
forgetting that hers will leave this
impress upon every inmate, while she 'i
overlooks no fault in others. Site nd
descends to idle 'gossip, too little and
nlindful of a woman's home-life, and f"u
forgetting that, as in old Iome the all
Lares made the home, so she now is well,
the presiding and conferring deity. l d
The training of boys also is rarely cold
that which will fit them to be loving Cr
I and thoughtful. If mothers would whit
I realize this, and educate their sons fil
for husbands, and to be gentle men melt
t indeed, half the sorrow of home-life to til
I would be avoided. Were boys taught preh
r to be courteous, kind, and attentive but
to their sisters, and were they made St
to understand that they had a duty swel

ger say as now, that husbands are cul
_also greatly respo.nsible for tile too te's
Suniversal wretchedness. fl
They too often address to their
e wives sharp, discourteonus words, of t
"Which they forget and we remem- ter 1
Sber," a young wife sadlly said to mte lish
athe other day. Fully absorbed iln
their owli pursuits, oblivious to the pea
Strials and needs of their wives, they amI
oftfer no word of cheer to those who irii
have labored wearily in dull monoto- ter
t ny all day. They give no aid in thely
i education of children, but deem their bak
r sole duty lies in providing pecuniary witl
I support; failing to read in the care
t worn, patient face, from which the E
e gid-blooml hlas too soon faded, silent fon
pleading for a little thoughtful ten- poi
derness, a little loving aid. True, wit
they love their wives devotedly; but ur
Slovea without the nameless little ten. and
, der acts which it should engender, is
Sas the flower bereft of its perfume; pi<*
r and, alas I too often suchnell love drives 01
e away devotion from tile grieved pe
n heart, while cold duty takes its place. sall
i All must realize this need of our hoi

niippigfg the tops of small ones, when
ever they are driven so near that they
can stretch out the nose and snatch a
