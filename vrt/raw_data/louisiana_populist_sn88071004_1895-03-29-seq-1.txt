'It. Development Since Paw g An
iUnder Government Control.
Washington, March 5.-A sketch Kn
showing the great development of
the telcgraph in Great Britain
since it passed under government
control in 18'0 as a result of Glad
stone's efforts, is given in a report
to the state department from Unit- I
ed'States Consul Martin at South- fice
ampton.- le shows that all of the chil
separate companies' lines were ac- lisli
quired by the government in 1870 dep
for $11,0,000,000, and that in the by
year succeeding, the government O00
built 15,000 miles of wire to con- whi
nect the various systems. As an Sei
illustration of the results of this r
policy the reports show that while Ga.
in 1870 the total number of tele- met
grams handled weekly by all offi- has
ces was estimated at from 128,000 pa
to 215,000, in 1893 the total num
her exceeded 1,100,000, and the qu'
number sent annually exceed 70,- des
000,000. In 1869 the English press it v
service was 22,000,000 words; now per
it amounts to 600,000,000 words, I
36 times more than formerly. The ani
present press rate is absurdly small mo
as compared with the tariff prior
to 1570, and in place of sending i
seventy-five words per minute one 1
way, the wires now carry five hun- j
dred words a minute and six mes- Ca
sages are sent simultaneously on
one wire. The service is perform
ed with perfect punctuality, the hot
average time of transmission of a wa
message being about seven or nine J
minutes, as against two or three to
hours in 1870. The rate is 12 cents
for twelve words paid by stamps.
It is not possible to calculate the ree
cost to the treasury of the tele- O0(
graph service becausm of its comrn- Se
bination with the postal servic ,
but the English government does
not consider it as a means of reve
nue, but rather as a means of help- me
ing trade and informing the pub- the
lic.--Noncon ormist. for

The Day of JMd rtea me
The omnipotent lobby has had
its way in the Arkansas Legisla
ture. Like Caesar, it came, saw po
and conquered. The chosen rep- bt
resentatives of the people who sur
rendered their State to the great me
railroad robber are now engaged
in protesting th9 purity of their
motives and the patriotism of their
intentions. As we have said be- gr
fore, we know nothing and care Re
'- nothing for this phase of the ques
tion. We have not presumed to
look into the minds of legislators 001
and read the secrets of their hearts. in
We know what they has e done;
and the consequences are just the o
same to the people of Arkansass,
whether the act was done with
it righteous or unrighteous motives. GI
e The people are "not in it." The
" railroad'lobby is monarch of all it
surveys--and it surveys practical
ly the whole State of Arkansas.
* I'ere is a place somewhere in the
tropics that is said to be paved ob
with the good intentions of men in
who always vote on the side of the
- railroad lobby. The inward holi
neses of hearts that went with the i
I. act will not help the State of, Ar- tr
kansaL. The man.who puta sknife

ing a palm through his' hose or

PAYING OUT GOLD.
Another Sch'me of the Gang to
Deplete the Gold Reserve.
Knavery, Duplicity and Rascality
at a premium.
Honesty at a Discount.
Bonds, it is Bonds, Bondage.
From letters re~-eived at this. of
fice, it now seems that the Roth
childs, Grover and John G. .Car
lisle have invented another plan to
depelte the gold reserve and there
by pave an excuse for the $100,
000,000 of 50 year gold bonds
which they intend to steal next
September or October.
Mr. C. W. Merritt of Macon,
Ga., informs us that all the govern
ment imployes were surprised to
have their pay handed over last
pay day in gold coin.
No one asked gold, no one re
quested or intimated that gold was
desired; no one expected gold, yet
it was handed over instead of pa
per money.
For utter depravity, duplicity
and infamy commend us to this
most infamous move.
What does it mean.
It means this:
Bonds, bonds, bondage.
Rothchilds, Graver and J. G.
Carlisle think they have the chumps
sufficiently scared that they will
hoard any gold coin coming their
way.
This is another method resorted
to by these conspirators 2against
our liberties to deplete the gold
reserve and pave the way for $100
000,000 of 50 year gold bonds in
September or October.
Also, and again there is another
infamous, cowardly and dastardly
motive in the deal. It is to call to
their aid, all the willing dupes, and
force them to assist in locking. up
gold and contracting the volume of
money.
This move if successful will send
the cotton crop of '95 to 3 cents a
pound; and whest to 25 cents a
bushel.
Now, there is another deep laid
motive in this deal.
It is to send gold to a premium.
As soon as the republican con
gress meets next December, Czar
Reed or some other, inluential re
publican will introduce a bill in
congress making imports payable
In gold.
This is the scheme my old dem
ocratic hayseeder, this is. the
scheme of your dear Grover.

'They Are Gone.
Tom Watsop, in writing the
i obituary of the late congresa, tells
Sin a graphic style how its history
has been one of brokea promises,
Sviolated pleots and disgr~aoeful
- treplery to the people thiey were
esupposed torepresent. From his
two-column "roat" we iepeat the
followirng:
"The' 68&d congress is dead

most rigorous and ruinous single

"Its campaign war-cry agaiust
the trusts and combinea was a cal
culated discord, artistically autro
duced, as a prelude and a conutrast
to the harmonies of sugar trust,
whiskey trust and standard oil
trust legislationr.
"Its denunciations of Watf
street, plutocracy and class laws,
turned out to be an effective
screen, cunningly contrived, be
hind which Cleveland, Stetson &
Co., were to conspirr with Roths
child, Belmont, Morgan & Co,.,
and were to manipulate the Imoz t
gigantic swindle we have known
since the palmy days of Jay Go'ld.
"Everything it promise] not to
do, it has done.
"Everything it prom!;~ts to do,
it has left undone.
"dOn every vital iss. it has re
versed its record, contradict~d its
words, gone opposite to its chart.
"With record which seemed to
promise an enlarged currency, it
has earned the paternal smiles of
old John Sherman by retiring more
than one hundred million of our
paper money, shutting off the coin
age of silver,. and giving to the
debt-holders twies as much cotton,
wheat, labor and land as his dollar
ever commanded before.";
The most heartrending feature
oaseQmted with ballot box stufIing
is that in almost every case it is
done by young men. The mana]
gers seem to always select the
young to do this nefarious work.
What is to become of our country ?
-Bulletin.
The old parties ridicule the isms.
of the Populist party. They fail
however to mention the fact that
there is one ism peculiar to the
two old parties with which the
Popuii' are not afflicted-hum.
bugism.--Arkansas, Referendum.
It's amusing to read in demo
cratic papers about the Populiatic
setback in the last election, when
the democrats throughout the na
tion met a defeat that means an
nihilation, while the Populists ad
ded over a million votes to their
vote of two years ago.-N-ew

a , populist, was elected mayor
by 800 majority over a .democratic
and republican fusion. Gradually
both old parties are throwing off
their mask and standing openly be-'
fore the world'in' their illicit alle
giance.
All the great republioa papers
are defpoding President Cleveland's
fnancial policy. Who says the
republican conjress won't carry it
a both old prtties are in favor
of free silver why don't we have it ?
Thty 1tkv the power to give it to
us. Somebody is lying, and some
body else is swallowing the lies,
although anyone otught to see them.
