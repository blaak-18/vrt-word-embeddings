Cst. Trett was one of the miost
promsdsPiyong men of our State,
young, ed , the very soul of
honor. Li' iwas opening for him
with all of its jsghtand luring hopes,
when death came to his door. PD
:ing bgslest ad fatal illess amidst
his a. ind the distress of his
 W vOdls, weak and postrated
ou. deit bed, came the blood
Lou.of tla.l Packard, to sum
mon him to their bastile--his house
wars sromanded 'and' the sanctity of
his death chamber nvaded by them.
Thus he died a virthal prisoner to
the U. S. deputy Marshal, prefering
to retn ilhis poble soul to the great
God who gave6 t, leaving his body to
,earthly changeb and the darkness of
the tomb. Theparish and State have
sustained an irreiarable loss in his
death, and to hi reaved family we
tender ouear heairtflt'eympathy.
We clip thd `be from thePeople's
Vindicator, a paper published in the
town and par h of Natchitoches, in

James H. Cosgrove,' who, with many
other citizens, is now suffering arrest
and imprisonment by order of the
above mentioned U. 8. Marshal Pack

"There was once a widower with a
little boy named Bobby, wlhv, like
most widowers, took a notion and
got married, and in the course of time
he was blessed with another son,
whom he named Johnny. 'Now,' said
he, 'though the new mother loved
Bobby very much, she loved Johnny
just a little more. She would split
open a: biscuit, butter both pieces,
and give due to Bobby and one to
Johnny, but she put sugar' on the
piece she gave to Johnny. Bobhy
one day discovered it, and, being hurt
at this exhibition of partiality, went
out on the front door-steps and comt
muenced crying. I'resently his father
came along and inquired: 'Bobby,
what are you,cryinugaIouit " 'N-o-t-h
i-n-g !' 'lltt, my son, you must be
crying about something. Tell me
what it is.' Bobby tlhn told his fath
er how his mother put sugar on John
ny's biscuit. '0, well, don't cry, my
son,' responded the father, 'you shall
have sugar on your biscuit, too;' but
the boy kept on crying, and said : 'I
don't care anything about the sugar.
It's the principle of the darned thing
I don't like !' Now, we don't care how
much the Radicals: help the negroes;
we don't care how much they favor
them; we don't care how much su
gar they have on their biscuit; but
i'tO the 'principle of the darned thing
we don't like!' [Loud lanughter.]

WHY YOUf SHOULD TAKE
THE CINCINNATI ENQUIRER,
It is the People's paper, devoted to
their interests and welfare.
It is an impartial friend to all men and
measures that benefit the country.
It is the enemy of all men and meas
ures that seek only personal gain at the
expense of the country's welfare.
Its editorial columns are for the espe
cial purpose of exposing the frauds of
government offticials, and laws couched
on languagecalealated to deceive the un
derstanding, and make plain to its read
ers the motives, causes and effects of
general and special legislative acts.
Its news columns contain the latest
news and intelligence that can be obtain
ed from the four quarters of the globe,
by means of the telegraph, mails and
correspondence.
Its agricultural columns are the best
adapted to the wants of farmers, all of
whom are invited. tp-give their, experi
ence and8 :elta ,er new ideas uad ex
periments of all kinds of improvements
calculated to advance the farming in
terests.
One issune of. the Enquirer contains
more solid information and intelligence,
than can be had from fifty of the so call
ed hteraty papers. None can lay aside
the Enqupirer without admitting a valu
able addition to his or her stock ofkno wl
laslmafe yf eas ieen
acknowledged as the most complete and

THE ALDINE, while Issued with all the

of pjrt4, light and graceful literatur" ; andl
a collo tion of pictures, the rarest spit-i
1mens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding number affords
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value, and beauty of the AIANnE will be
most apptÂ·e iated after it la:hin einl bound
nip at the clohsi of the year. While other
jutrnaals may claiiim Mtpelir.oihertlPlnes4, as
tc,,pared with rivals of a similar class,
the A,1INE is a unique and origitad con
e -ltio- alie and unapl'proa.ehld aliso

chlrtrcter. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplieste the gnant ty of
line paper and engravings in any other
shape or number of volumes lfor tent times
its cost ; and then, there are the Chroulos
besides !
ART DEPARTIMENT, 1874.
The illustrations ot the AuINE have
won a world-wide reputation. und in the
art centres of Europe it is an admuitted frct
that its wood cuts are exasmpls of the
highest perftction ever attained. The
comnton prejutdice in favorof 'steel plates'
is rapidly 3ielding to amiore educatedt and
discriminating taste which recognizes the
a:dvantages and superior artistic quality
with greater facility of lirodnetlon. The
wood-eltts of the AwLDic posse atll the
delicacy and elaborate tinish of. the most
eostly steel plate,, while they afford a bet
ter rendering of the artist's original.
To fully realiae the wonderful work
whicli the Aldine is doing for the cause.of
art ottitire in Anmerica, it is only neces
sary to cofsider the cost to' the people of
any other' decent' reprMienltations of the
prolodtions of great painters.
In addition to designs by the members
of the National Academy and other noted
American artists, the Aldine will repro
dnce examples of the best foreign masters,
hsleted with a view to the highest aitis
tie success and greatest general interest.
Thus the subscriber to the Aldine will, at
a trilling cost, enjoy in his own home the
pleasutrcs and reolinug intfluences of true
art. -t -
The qluarterly tinited plates for 1874 still
be by Tlus. Moran and J. D. Woodward.
The Christmas issue for 1874 will cou
taili special designs appropriate to the
season, by our best artists, aml will sur
las- in attractions any of its predecessors
Prteuuiuams for 1874.
Every subscriber to the Aldine for 1874
will receive a pair of chronmos. The orig
inal pictures were painted in oil for tile
publishers of the Aldine, by Thomas Mo
ran, whose great Colorado picture was
purchased by Congress for ten thousand
dollars. The sulbjects were chosen to rep
resent ' The East" and "The West." One
is a view of the White Mountains, New
Hampshire; the other, gives the clifft of
Green River, Wyoming Territory. The
difference in the nature of the scenes
themselves is a pleasing contrast. and af
fords a good ditqlay of the artist's scope
and coloring. The. chromes are each work
ed from thirtydistinct plates, and are in
nsi, (1'h tb I ) and a)pearagee exact fac
similes of the originaels. The presentation
of a worthy example of America's greatest
landscape pahlte'to the snbserThers of the
Aldine was a bold bit peculitrly happy
idea, and its sucecesslid realization is at
tested by the following testimonlal, over
the signature of Mr. Mt4an himself:

Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever lionie a
widespread and unblemished repuntation
for the unsurpaased purity, refinement

It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
rnever containing anything that would
offendi the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
coumld not be read at day fireside without
objection from the nmost fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through hot quite so ,large
perhaps, as its younger contemporatries,
is not, like that of some of them, fiuctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID AND SUBSTANTFAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on anly ex
tra eios influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in tihe
futuro, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance Writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
