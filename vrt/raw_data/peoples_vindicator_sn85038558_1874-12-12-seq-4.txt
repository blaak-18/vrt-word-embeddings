treatment, a purgative; 'eerting a
powerful influence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose

BITTERs, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy funo
