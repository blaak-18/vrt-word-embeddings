Some Fly Observations
If a fly drops Into a beer glass, says
a German paper, one who has made a
study of national charateristics can
easily tell the drinker's natianality by
his action. A Spaniard pays for the
beer, leaves it on the table and goes
away without saying a word. A
Frenchman will do the same, except
that he swears while he goes. An
Englishman spills the beer and or
ders another. A German carefully
fishes out the fly and finishes drink
ing his beer as if nothing had hap
pened. A Russian drinks the beer
with the fly. A Chinaman fishes out
the fly. swallows it and then throws
away the beer. An American. if it is
on a Fourth of July, does not see the
fly. It all goes.
The missionaries in China are
greatly praised for the hospital work
they freely did during the late war.
In Tien Tsin they opened and con
ducted a hospital at their own ex
pease and saved many lives.

Galvanised steel Wire Pameolan
The most extensive and complete
plant for the manufacture of wire fenc
ing in the United States is the De Kalb
Fence Company, located at De Kalb,
IlL For years prior to 1190 barbed
wire was extensively used for
fencing, but those using it often lost in'
fine stock, more than its cost and to'
avoid danger to man or beast there was
need of, and a demand for, a barbless
fence.
The proprietors of this company
having spent more than 12 years in the
manufacture of wire fencing. recog
nised this fact, and have produced the
best lines of smooth wire fencing for all
purposes now In aose. The success of
this company is due to the marnagers
adopting the true business principle of
making good what they make, putting,
enough material in their lines to make
them both strong and serviceable, in
stead of producing a cheap flimsy ar
ticle only to meet the price of a fence
that has never given satisfaction. This
Is what has mad6 their fence so popular
and in such great demand and to-day
they have over 40 special machines,
with a capao'ty of over 22 miles of
fence per day, and their fencing is used
In every state in the Union. The fence
most used is their Cable Steel and Hog
Fence for field fencing, Cable Poultry
Fence, Steel Web Picket Fence, and
Park and Cemetery Fence, and to com
plete same they also make gates of wood.
or steel frames to match, and also fur
alsh iron posts. All of their styles of
fencing are strong, neat. durable and
economical in prioe.
And everyone needing fencing of any
kind will oonsult their own interests by

WASHITAS GOLD.
LD JONAS and his
companion, Robert
W~hite. had strayed
away from the'
1Z mining camp and a
were alone in a
wild, desolate part
of the Rocky Moun
tains.
Jonas was an old
time miner, and
knew the mountains k
S " as well as any man
living.
Robert White was merely a boy, aud
a comlarative tenderfoot.
It wns the noon hour, and the two had
halted to partake of their Emall store
of rations. They had been eating for i
several minutes in silence when at last
Jonas said:
"Looks kind o' diseouragin' at the C
present writin', don't it?"
"Rather," Robert replied. r
"We've been away from camp a w~r k
now," Jonas went on, "an' though we\ve U
iut in the time steady lookin' for Old
Washita's great heaps o' gold, we hain't
se n no hair nor hide of it so fer."
"No." Robert admitted, "and it he
gins to look a little like we were not
going to see' anything of the kind."
"It does look a leetle that way, for a
fact." Jonas agreed. "To my mind the '
chances air that the blamed Injun w<as
lyin' all the time when he told 'bout so
mu'h gold."
"Then you've about concluded that g
w are on a wild goose chase?"
"Yes, jest about. You see, Bob, Old a
Weishita said the gold was to be found n
on this here slope. 'twixt the foot o' the g
spur up thar an' the river down yon- d
der."
"Yes, that's true."
"Wal, we've searched the ground over C
faithfully time an' ag'in, hain't we?"
"Yes."
"An' we hain't had a smell o' no gold J
neither, have we?"
"No." b
"Then don't it begin to look kinder t
like the old Injun lied?" t
"Well, it does look that way, Jonas; s
but yet I can't hardly believe he did.
You know the old man was dying, and i
we had taken him in and cared for him, n
and I can't believe that he would hatch \
up a lie under such circumstances just a
to get us to make a chase like this." t
"it don't look like he would, shore
enough," Jonas admitted, scratching d
his head perplexedly. "But what 11
puzzles me is this, Bob. If thar's any 1
gold here like that old Injun told 'bout, a
whar is it? That's the question I'd like d
to have answered, if you please. I
"It's a question I can't answer, sure," f
Bob said, with a shake of his head.
"Still, I think Old Washita was honest, n
and that the gold is somewhere in this
vicinity." '
"I wish to gracious I knowed whar I
'bouts in this vicinity," old Jonas said I
with a sigh. "I've counted lots on a
findin' that gold, an' figgered out
how how I'd go back East to c
my wife an' children an' make a nice a
home for 'em; an'%ow it comes mighty
hard to be disapp'inted an' have all my a
figgerin' go for nothin'."
"Yes, it's pretty tough," Bob admitted I
sadly; "but if we can't find the gold we I
can't help it. We've done our part in
searching for it faithfully."
"Yes, an' thar's nothin' more we kin
do. Tough as it is to do so, we've got to I
g've up the sarch an' go back to camp, y
an' take to work for wages ag'in. Our
dream o' wealth is shore knocked out." t
"It certainly looks like it." t
There followed a long silence, during c
which Jonas and Bob appeared very I
thoughtful. The failure to find the
great amount of gold Old Washlta had t
a
I

J
TEE GOLD LAY IN BHINING HEAPS t
told about was a great disappointment
to them both.
Old Jonas bad spent years In the I
West seeking a fortune, and always
luck had been agatsht him. Time and
again he had been one of the frst to
rweach a new goldfeld and stake oRff a
claim, and while othetrs who came aft- z
s, struck wealth all around him, his c
elaims invariably turned out worthless.
To him it began to look as though for- t
tune had decreed that he should never t
gain a stake.
Bob was a new hand in gold-hunting, l
and as yet he had not received very t
many rebuffs from fortune. Only for aII
few months had he been in the moun
tains, and consequently he had not had b
time to set a taste of the disappoilt- e
ments that had fallen to the lot of t
Jonas. Still he had come out full of
confidence, and even a few months' de
lay in the accumulatlon of a fortune
was a grenat disappolntment.
Bob, however, was more regretful of
their failure this time on old Jonas' ao
count than on his own. o
Two or three months before he had
been very scek, and old Jonas, seeing
that be had no fMends near, took care
et him asu a father would, and nursed a
him beck to health agairn.
'rom that time Bob had loved the
old ma, and had been anlous at alld
times to do something to repay his d
kinadnaes
He knew how much Jons wanted to
return to his wile and children, and a
when old Washlta, who came to them
alk and dylng, and was tlake tin and t
eamid for by them, told them oft great 5
heaps of gold over on the slope to the I
a-t, Bob resolved that for Jonms' eake, a
e. then bis own, they would find a
that gai.

was anything to be found, we'd shorel)
a-run across it before this."
"Yes, that's true. Still, I hate to give
the thing up."
"So do I, Bob. I hate it tarnation bad
You don't know how much I counted on
findin' that stuff, an' how I've planned
and flilgered on how I'd do after I got
it. 1,tb," lie said softly. "I''e hoped
ever since (ld W'ashlta died to be able
soon to go back home, an' thinkin'
'bout my wife an' children has set me
to yearnin' to see 'em. an' now this dis
appointment is almost klllln'. It jest
knocks me all to pieces, an' right now
I'd be glad if a streak o' lightnln' would
come down an' kill me."
"Jonas." Bob cried, "don't talk like
that. We will find something yet. Other
things will come up for us. and before
long our fortune will turn."
"Mine will never turn, Bob. I've give
it a fair showin', an' it never turns. I'11
die poor, an' I'll never see my wife an'
children ag'ln. I give it all up."
"'lut you musn't do it, Jonas," Bob
remonstrated, laying his land on the
old man's shoulder. "You must lrep
Up courage and hope for the best."
Bob did not feel very sanguine him
self. but he was not ready to give up
the fight.
Having given up the search for
Washita's wealth. Jonas and Bob
pa.ick.d up their "traps" and started
slowly back up the slope on their way
to the camp over the range. They
walked along in silence, too sad to talk.
\When they had gone a short distance
Bob noticed a small opening in the
ground at the root of a large upturned
tree. He stepped up close to it to ex
amine it, though for what reason he did
not know, when suddenly the earth
gave way under his feet, and he shot
downward and disappeared from view.
Jonas saw him go and hurried for
ward, and called after him, but re
ceived no reply. Then he peered down
in the hole, but could see nothing.
After a minute or so there came to
Jonas' ears the noise of a terrible
scuffling down below. He called again,
but got no answer. The scuffling con
tinued for a little longer, then there was
the report of a pistol. Then all was
silent.
Five minutes elapsed and Jonas was
I beginning to grow frantic. Had Bob
been killed, or why did he not answer?
I What was the meaning of that scuffling,
t and that shot, and the deathlike silence
that followed?
Jonas cast about for some means of
descending into the hole, but could find
t none. HIe thought of the rope they had
r brought with them and decided to tie
one end of it to a tree and let himself
down, but then he remembered that
Bob carried the rope, and that when he
fell he took it down with him.
"What can I do?" he cried aloud, al
most wild with anxiety.
Several minutes passed, and Jonas
had just resolved to leap down after
r Bob, when the latter suddenly ap
I peared, not more than ten feet below,
1 and called out:
t "Catch the rope, Jonas. and fasten
one end to a tree, and come down and
see what I've found."
"Are you safe an' sound, Bob?" Jonas
asked.
"Safe and sound as a dollar, Jonas,"
1 Bob replied, "and rich as Old What's
e his-name."
1 "Rich?"
"Yes. I've killed a bear and found
i Old Washita's gold. There's a wagon
load of It. Come down and see for
yourself."
r It did not take old Jonas many min
utes to tie the rope and descend into
the hole, which led back Into a little
r cave, where the gold lay 1n shining
heaps just as Old Washlta had said.
One look at the precious metal and
I then Jonas threw his arms around Bob
and cried like a child.
"It was the luckiest day of my life,"
he said, "when I went to nurse you
through that sickness."
"And the luckiest day of both our
lives," Bob added, "when we took the
old Indian in and cared for him."
Jonas was silent a moment, and then
he said earnestly:
"Bob, this looks like a reward for
doing right toward our fellow-men,
don't it?"
"It does."
There was another long silence, then
Jonas said:
"Bob, I'll never again find fault with
fortune. If a man does his duty and
does It well fortune will smile oa him
In time."
"I believe that," Bob acquiesced.
"An' now, at last," Jonas went on,
"I'll it to see my wife an' children.
We're both rich, an' we'll go back east
I together, an' we'll enjoy life."
S"Yes," was all I1,b said.
But that was enough. He was too
Shappy to see Jonas' joy to say more.

Baging at the Knee.
A woman claiming to be a Boston,
woman, and at the same time saying
"-pants" instead of *'trousers," says
that, because of the difference in the
formation of the knees of men and of.
women, pants, when worn by woman,
do not bag at the knees so soon nor
so badly as when worn by man.. Thus
it is seen that not only have women
a moral and a historical right to wear
pants, but also a physical and an aes
thetic one. But this discovery will
not interfere with the introduction of
the Bloomer garment, which is noth
ing but a bag at the knee and which,

The Game of Golf.
People are apt to consider that
golf in England is quite a modern in
troduction, and it will be news to
many that it was popular and that it
flourished pretty close to London
more than a hundred years ago.
Evidences of this may be found in a
fine engraving by Valentine Green of
a picture after L. F. Abbott, entitled
"Golfers on Blackheath," and dated
1790.
