Present IhJase of the Matter Is Re.
garded as Acute.
MUNITIONS OF WAR.
It Is Reported 'at There Have Been
Several Heavy Purchases Lately
Made by Roumania, Balkan
States and Turkey.
London, Jan. 31.-The publication
of the French yellow book detailing ef
forts made by France and Russia dur
ing the past year to induce Turkey to
institute reforms in Macedonia which
resulted in a tour through the Balkans
of Count Lamsdorff and in an Austro
Russian agrement regarding press re
forms in Turkey point to the fact that
an acute phase of Balkan question has
arisen.
Rumors of AuStria preparing a
squadron at her naval port, of Pola for
passage of Russian torpedo boats
brought through the Dardanelles into
the Black sea and other incidents are
being recalled, rumors issued by Aus
trian government are received with
some skepticism.
There have been recently several re
ports of hasty purchases of war ma
terial by Roumania, Balkan states and
Turkey.
The yellow book confirms the state
ment that France approves of Count
l amsdorff's proposal to institute radi- I
cal reforms in Macedonia. and gives
a gloomy account of the deplorable
conditions prevailing in Macedonian
provinces. Reports are current in
Odessa that Austria and Russia have
agreed upon a joint naval coercion of
Turkey in the approaching spring to
enforce reforms in Macedonia.
According to Professor Bambury,
who is supposed to be well informed
as to the views entertained at Yildiz
Kiosk the sultan, believing the inten
tion is to wrest Macedonia from the
Turkish empire, would prefer risks in,
war to acquiescence in European de
mands. The drift of European com
ment is that although there is no im
mediate danger, the situation is caus
ing diploniatists the keenest anxiety.

They Canse Considerable Concern and
SSaurp.l e in Par's.
Paris, Jan. 31.-The foreign office
I has received a lengthy official advice a
giving details of the rejection by the
allies of the proposal that France and
other countries receive equal treatmut
in the Venezuelan settlement.
Frnch officials had not doubted tha
equal treatment would be recognized.
and this unexpected turn of events has
caused much surprise and concern.
After conferring with those in chief
authority an official said that the
French position is based on two essen
tial principles. The first is that in a
pacific settlement between two sover
eign nations each is entitled to at least
equal treatment. If not, a precedent
would be established, officials say,
which would be incentive to war, as
ccuntries first adopting force in collec
tion of claims would have superior
rights to those observing usual pacific
means of settlement. The view is
strongly held here that the United
States, France and Belgium are in ef
fect pacific allies, as they did not resort
to force against Venezuela.
It is insisted that the present atti
tude with the allies tends not only to
prejudice the `rights of pacific allies,
but also establishes the dangerous
principle that resort to war is prefer
able to efforts Vo maintain peace.
The second principle of the French
position is that the France-Venezuelan
settlement is in the form of a treaty,
which entitles it to international rec
ognition. This was formally executed
prior to the adoption of force by the al
lies, and while Venezuela retained full
independence in the exercise of her
soverign right to make a treaty. There
fore, it is maintaindd. this antedates
rights arising from resort to force. It
is not insisted, however, that this prior
treaty settlement entitles France to
priority in the division of customs rev
enues, as officials hold all powers hav
ing claims should receive equal treat
ment. It was at first supposed Great
Britain, Germany and Italy favored
this view and that the opposition came
from the personal attitude of their rep
resentatives, but latest advices indi
cate a sympathetic attitude of the Brit
1st ambassador at Washington, Sir
Michael Herbert, German charge d'af
taires, Count von Quadt. and Italian
ambassador, Signor Mayer Des Plan
ches, who are reqiricted in their in
structions. Full recognition is given
of evident fairness of Minister Bowen.
CANNOT BE PUBLISHED.
In Event of Refarl Mislater Bowen Wilt
Confer With Other Powers.
Washington. Jan. 30.-No answer
yet has come from the allied powers
to Mr. Bowen's last propositions
The British ambassador sent a long
eablegram to 'Lord Lansdowne Thurs
day-afternoon, stating what might be
expected =in case Great Britain ,and
her two allies insisted on preferential
treatmeht for blockading powers. The
text of the cablegram cannot be pub
lished. but it is inferred by the for
eign office that Minister Bowen, in the
event of the refusa "of his proposition,
would call upon representatives of
other clalmant powers in Washington
and ctate to them that Venezuela was
being forced by the triple alliance to
yield to a plaS Which: wuld affect se

Most Daring Charge.
Manila, Jan. 31.-Eight Ladrones and
