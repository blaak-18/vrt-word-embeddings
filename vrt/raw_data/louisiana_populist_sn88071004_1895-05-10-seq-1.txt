SURPLUS AND DEFICIT

L.ANDISM.
Wall Street Ih Fersting on the DPcleit
as It Did on the Surplus--Gr ver's
Nefarious Mheales Brought to
Light.
During the first administrationl of
Marlah llalpin's man Cleveland, this
country. was told in ponderous sen
tences all about the awful havoc that
the surplus was making with the pros
perity of the people.
The Surplus became a nightmare,
a scare-crow, an old Man of the Sea;
and we got to the point where we
could hardly go to bed in confidence
and comfort unless we first looked
under the bed to see that the surplus
was not laylan in wait to murder us in
our slumbers.
Cleveland had kept talking about
Surplus, Surplus, Surplus, until lots
of us began to have the same feeling
toward it that a negro used to have
toward the Ku Klux Klan.
So seriously disturbed were we in
our minds about the dangers and the
deadfalls, the snares and the man
traps, the deceits and the betrayals,
whblc' Mr. Cleveland assured us
lurked in the inner caverns of the
Surplus, that we implored him to save
us-to save us by any methods what
ever from the armed enemies of our
national welfare which crouched con
cealed within the insides of this mod
ern Trojan Horse of a Surplus.
After our scare was over, and the
Surplus had been met and conquered
by the hero of Buzzard's Roost, we
grcw calm enough to listen to a cold
recital of the facts, and to realise the
exact nature of the perils we had es
caped.
The Surplus, It seemed, was a pile
of money which had been collected
from the tax-payers, over and above
the needs of the Government, and
which the office-holders atsolutely
could not spend.
This was awful indeed.
It is difficult to exaggerate the
mental agonies of two or three hun
dred thousand office-holders who
have to stand in sight of a big pile
of public money day after day, week
after week, month after month, and
not have the power to lay their fever
Ish fingers upon It.
It is the unwritten law of this bless
ed Republle that the Government must
spend at least as much as the tax
payers can be made to pay.
By an oversight, Congress had failed
to increase the expenses in proportion
to the increase of the Tariff and Inter
nal Revenue Taxes, and hence, to the
disgust and dismay of Cleveland and
his tribe, the taxes far exceeded the
expenses Congress had authorized.
No wonder the disturbance in oa
cial circles was so great. No weonder
Mr. Cleveland made the continent
tremble as he heavily held forth on
the dangers of a Surplus.
What was to be done with the
money?
Andrew Jackson had, under similar
ehreumtanoes, divided the Surplus
among the states--hus sending the
money the Government didn't seed
beek to the people to whom it be
longd.
Jackson, however, and his kind of
Demeesey being deader than Pha
reoh, Mr. Cleveland sever once thought
of getting that Surplus .moasy back
into the pockets of the people to whom
It belonged.
As is well known, he made a gift of
about sixty million dollars of It to the
Wall tirest bondholders, by way
of premiums, tar the privilege of
payg Goveramet debts whtah were
not duoe.

Republicans scraped the bottom at
Uncle Sam's cash-box, and a Deficit
began to be a small cloud upon the
horison-no larger yet than a man's
hand.
Chas. Foster prepared Republican
plates for the issue of Republican
bonds in order to get more money.
The In-coming Democrats indig
nantly stopped the plan, and sternly
rebuked the planners.
The Democratic Congress even used
lippy language to Charles Foster about
daring continue 4% per cent bonds at
2 per cent. I recollect that Judge
Turner. the able Democratic statesman
of South Georgia who has so nimbly
boxed the entire compass on the finan
cial question, was seriously displeased
with said Poster for venturing to re
new national debts which Democrats
were ready to pay.
Then came the Billion-dollar Crisp
Congress No. 1.
And then the Billion-dollar Crisp
Congress No. 2.
But before the Democrats had been
on deck long enough to get the pie
counter questions adjusted, the Deficit
was upon us-a gigantic, remorseless,
and devouring Deficit.
Wall Street is feasting upon the De
ficit just as it did upon the Surplus.
In Cleveland's first administration
they fattened upon premiums and free
deposits.
In his second, they fattened on non
taxed bonds, and ten million dollar
private deals. Foster's plates are
doing heroic duty grinding out 5 per
cent bonds---ad Judge Turner saying
nothing.
The dangers of a Surplus brought
pie to the bondholders.
The perils of a Deficit bring pie to
the bondholders.
. They pleinder us when we pay too
much, and they despoil us when we
pay too litt!e.

"Paterntallsn" In Toronto, Canada.
Toronto, Canada, has a population of
about 200,000. It sells its street railway
privileges-not (or boodle, as our
American cities uo, but to the highest
bidder at public auction, and as a re
sult that city is deriving a large income
from the street ra!lways, and enjoys
cheaper fares and a far better service
than under the old system.
No long-time franchises are granted,
but periodically the companies are
compelled to bid for the privilge of us
ing the streets, which, as can be easily
seen, compels companies to operate
their lines for the accommodation of the
public.
At the last letting, despite the strin
gent conditions imposed by the muni
cipal authorities, three companies sub
mitted bids for the privilege of using
the streets, and as a result the city
receives $1,600 a year for each mile of
double track operated, and a graduated
tax on the gross earnings of 8 per cent
on the first million dollars, on the next
five hundred thousand dollars 10 per
cent, and so on in a progressive scale,
the rate going as high as 20 per cent on
all receipts over three million dollars.
The city determines the rate of fares,
ordinary tickets being sold six for 25
cents, or 25 tickets for $1. Tickets for
working people, good morning and
evening, are sold at eight for 25 cents,
while school children ride for two and
a half easts.
The revenue derived by thecity from
this source is $12,000, a sum four times
as large as the revenue derived by the
city of Chicago from its street car
lines, and yet (cago has ten times
the population of 'oronto.
When it is suggested that it is posal
ble to have such thins in this country
we have a elan of people who are at
es sesed with spasmo of "paternal
Im," who lift their handi in holy hor
ror at anything that would have a ten
deacy to relieve the people of monopo
ie burdeks.
In spite of the fact that hundreds of
etles ia this country own their own
water works, gas and electric lighting
plats, and in every saingle instance
ttre satisfactia being rendered, you

"That weu't do; that's patrnalism,"

pie who are havia the shivers for fear

eountry, woueldn't know it it they should
meet it in the road.

DANGER IS AHEAD.
WE MUST NOT ABANDON OUR
PLATFORM.
The Next People's Party Convention Must
Be Contronled By Popullsts-A Pepa
list Is Knows by His Iadoremeat of
Popullst Principles.
In all the discussion that has been
going or with regard to the relation
that should exist between the People's
party and the new silver party, there is
one impostant phase of the matter
which, so far as we know, has not
bnss touched. It is the question as to
who will control the national conven
tioes o the People's party in 1896? It
Mr. Taubeneck's "policy" is indorsed
we understand that the fight is to be
made on the currency question alone.
If he has not said so in so many words,
there can be no other Inference from
what he does say. Now suppose we do
this. Suppose that all the Populist
papers would take up the fight on this
line. The object would be to unite all
who oppose the money power. On this
basis every man who favored free coin
age of sliver at the ratio of 16 to 1, and
opposed banks of issue and interest
bearing bonds, would be eligible to elec
tion as a delegate to the national con
vention. This would let down the
bars for nearly every democrat in the
west and south, and many republicans
in the same sections. No better plan
could be conceived for the purpose of
turning the People's party over to the
politicians of the two old parties, and
permitting them to control the conven
tion, make the platform to suit them,
or break the convention up in a row.
If it Is urged that this will not be the
case, we ask how are you going to
help it? The politicians will take every
advantage they see open. With suoh
an arrangement Bland and Bryan aad
the whole trib of demaagogues could
come in. How could they be kept out?
It is understood that we ams going to
make the fight along those lines and
that is what they are fighting for. At
the very outset we start with the avow
ed object of trimming the platform.
What for? To satisfy men who are
not now in the party. Gen. Weaver
admits that the "next national coeven
teon will be factional." That is it will
feollow in the footsteps of the two old
parties and formulate its platform, not
from the standpolat of principles, but
as as to "eatch the voter 'gwlae and
seema'." This is Mr. Tanbeneck's
pelcy, and the policy of the politicians.
It verr ema~aed from the people, nor
will t be ladorsed by them. It is the
pelley which prompted the reanch
revoltiests to unitse Indeposing the
king, sad afterwards to turn and de
stroy each other, making *hat is
knoew as the 'roeb eo trerm."
The Feple% party as at presset
eamposes is gr setelly a unit na the

rare raepins is the the dark All
. vs We w
are thirsting for knowledge. So far as
the old parties are concerned, they are
demoralized. Now is our golden op
portunity. Now is the time to spread
the true gospel of reform. Why should
we hesltaate now, and only take up
questions which the two old parties will
likely cover in some way that will de
lude the voters again? Why not throw
our anti-monopoly banner to the breeze
and announce to the world that we are
opposed to all monopolies and will
fight it out on this line if it takes a
thousand years? The election of of
icers is not always a victory. It brings
with it responsibilities and the redemp
tion of pledges. To meet the expecta
tions of the people we must be able
not only to unite before election, but to
stay united afterward. The Fifty
third congress is a valuable object les
son in support of the truth of this
statement. The party was united at the
polls, but divided in congress. It had
the responsibility, but with a large
majority in congress it failed to carry
out its pledges. The success of the
democratic party in 1892, was its
Waterloo. To command the respect of
the voters in this country a party must
be consistent. It is not so when it
changes its platform to suit the poli
ticians' whims. The People's party
platform may need some change in
phraseology and possibly the dropping
of one or two features, and the addi
tion of that many others, but the
questions of finance, transportation and
land must not be disturbed. If we
were suggesting changes we would
make no reference to the subtreasury
and incorporate the referendum and
government banks into the platform.
All these things will come, and they
are going to come soon. We must
learn to be patient. The worst ene
mies the People's party has are the
men in the party who want office and
ean't wait until we can win a legiti
mate victory. These men may be well
meaning enough, but their judgment is
warped by inordinate desire for ofcial
position. Uncle Charley Cunningham
once said to the writer: "Morgan, we
could handle the - rascals if it
wasn't for the - fools in our party."
The logic of events is doing more for
us now than we are doing for ourselves.
The People's party is growing as it
never did before. Why strike our fag
and enter into the clamor for a new
party. Why disband our army that
presents a solid front and go over to
one that has no front at all? The man
who insists on it and seeks by his per
sistence to turn nine men out of every
tea his way, will find that he has
"kicked a durn solid dog," as the fel
low said when he kicked the cast Iron
representation of a canine.

The Rotten Metropolltan Prtes.
Events are constantly occurring to
prove that capit)ism is constantly
making the public prints a vehicle for
the conveyance of plutocratic ideas to
the public, and that the metropolitan
papers are run by hirelings who are
paid to write what they do not believe,
whose duty it is to conceal the truth
and write what they know is not true.
A year or so ago when the Lombard
Investment company failed, which was
a British company and plastered mort
gages over Missouri, Kansas and other
states, among the assets accounted for
by the receiver were shares in the Kan
ss City Times to the amount of $57,
000. This accounted for the tone and
policy of that paper-one of the most
rabid gold-bug sheets in the west.
What did the Lombard Investment
company want with stock in that pa
per? The sheet never has paid its own
ers a legitimate dividend, or dividend
on legitimate newspaper business.
That stock-with a great deal more
from other sources, perhaps, for the
same purpose, was to control the pol
icy of the paper in the interest of capi
talism. Here is an instance where we
have the direct proof that English cap
italists are using our American prints
to not only educate American voters in
their duties, but browbeat and abuse
them for standing in the way of the
schemes of these foreign robbers.
It is said as a matter of fact that of
the seven leading papers in New York
city, a majority of the stock of five
of them is owned by English capital
Ists, and yet the American people are
sucking their poison from such sources
-from the paid hirelings who manage
them and, who simply make commera
of their opinions!
All over the country as a rule, the
papers-democratic and republican,
that carry the Associated Press dis
patches are owned largely by bankers,
railroads and other corporations, and
these investments are not made with
the view or expectation of profit in the
same-as many of them are worthless
so far as dividends are concerned, but
the investments are made for the pur
pose of controlling the papers and ues
them in aiding them in their manf
schemes of g~.dering the people.
Bankers have mortgages on many
plants throughout the country for no
other purpose than placing these pa
peor under obligations to them, and,
thus enabling them to mold the pollc
of the papers particularly regarding tMh
national banking question. You don't
see any metropolitan dailies in the
smaller cities saying anything in con
demnation of the national banking
system, or corporate interests gener
ally, do you? The reason is that the
penny-a-liners do not dare to do so.
If they did they would lose their job.
Men employed on the metropolitan
papers do not dare to write their heo
est convictions, as not a mag ameng
them would bold a job an hour, it he
should tell the truth, Instead t wrt-.
lai what he knew to be a lie.

A
Completely Paralyzed.
PHYSICIANS ARE ASTOUNDED
BY A PECULIAR CASE.
A Young Man Stricken With Landry's
laralysis and Yet Recovers.
(From the Times, Philadelphia. Pa.)
Stricken with Landry's Paralysis and
fyt cured. That means but little to the
average layman but it means a miracle
to a physician. Such is the rare expert
eace of C. E. Dallimore, of Madison,
N. J.
"Yes, it Is true that I had Landry's
Paralysis," said Mr. Dallimore to a re
pbrter, "or else the most celebrated
physicians of London were mistaken.
"It was on the 15th of March, this
year," he continued. "when I was In
New York City, that I first felt the
symptoms of my trouble. I experienced
difficulty In going upstairs, my legs
falling to support me. I consulted a
physician, who informed me that I had
every symptom of Locomotor Ataxia,
but as the case developed he pro
nounced it a case of Landry's Paralysis
and knowing the nature of the disease,
advised me to start for my home and
friends. I gave up my work and on
April 1st started for London, Ont. A
well-known physician was consulted.
but I grew rapidly worse and on Satur
day. April 7, several eminent physicians
held a consultation on my case and In
formed me that I was at death's door,
having but three to aix days to live,
still I lIngered on, by this time complete
ly paralyzed, my hands and feet being
dead, I could hardly whisper my wants
and could only swallow liqulds, and
death would realy have been a welcome
visitor.
"Now comes the part that has as
tounded the physicians. Rev. Mr.
Gondy, a clergyman who visited me In
my last hours, as he supposed, told Pne
of the marvelous cures of paralfsis
that had been performed by Dr. Will
iams' Pink Pills for Pale People. I
started to take the pills about April 28
and a week after that felt an improve
ment in my condition. There was a
warm, tingling sensation in the limbs
that had been entirely dead and I soon
began to move my feet and hands, the
Improvement continued until May 28,
when I was taken out of bed for a drive
and drove the horse myself. By the
first of July I was able to walk
upstairs alone and paid a visit to Nia
gara.
Slowly but surely I gained my old
health and strength leaving Ontario for
New York on Oct. 11 and beginning
my work again on Oct. 26. 1394. Cured
of Landry's Paralysis in eight months."
To confirm his story beyond doubt Mr.
I'allimore made affidavit.

An Attraetive Featar.
An attractive feature of the Cotton
States and International exposition,
to be held at Atlanta, Ga., next Sep
tember, will be the reproduction of
tho World's Columbian exposition in
miniature by G. W. Ferris, the builder
of the Ferris wheel. The great
world's fair will be reproduced in its
entirety, complete in every detail, on
a scale of 1-140th. This makes the
manufactures and arts building about
ten feet long and the whole exposition
seventy-five feet long. Searchlights
will be shown on the battleship and
the various buildings, the intramural
railway will be seen with cars in mo
