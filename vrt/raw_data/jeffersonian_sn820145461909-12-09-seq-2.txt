PAGE TWO
INDORSES MRS. JOHNSTON.
N YOUR Weekly of the 18th
of November Mrs. Beulah
Johnston nails down some
mighty solid facts in regard
T
to the solving of the negro question.
The tone c£ her article causes me to
believe she had reference to what I
had to say in my article in "Fuss”,
which was copied on the first page
of the weekly Jeffersonian of Octo
ber 7, 1909. If so, I will say to
her, and all others, that I am strictly
with her in what she has to say
about Southern homes not having
the conveniences that most North
ern homes are supplied with.
It is a fact that the great majority
of homes of the South have not one
tenth of the conveniences that they
could and should have. Any person
with a little forethought can quickly
see around almost any home where
there could be made improvements
that would cost but little time and
money, and which would be the
means of saving countless numbers
of steps and many dollars every year
to the owners of the homes.
I wish the lazy men of this coun
try would wake up long enough to
fix up some shelving, tables, hooks,
benches, etc., in their kitchens,
dining-rooms, pantries, smokehouses,
barns and other places around the
home, which could be used for stor
ing away canned fruits, vegetables,
jellies, syrups, soaps, spices, and in
fact hundreds of little things that
are in daily use around the home.
In short, you can make your homes
a great deal more comfortable by
putting it in "railroad style”, and it
will be the means of saving the
womenfolks a lot of worry and work
that they now have to do, and then,
in many cases, we can afford to
"fire” the trifling, lazy, polecat
perfumed "ladies and gentlemen of
color” that we are now feeding and
who do not give us any profit for so
doing.
I agree with Mr. Watson to a cer
tain extent in regard to the secret
societies being responsible for the
present attitude of the negro. But
I contend that we white people can
put these secret societies out of ex
istence if we will work in away to
force the trifling, lazy wretches to
go to work for a living. It takes
time to attend these secret meetings,
and money to maintain them, and if
we white people will just go to do
ing our own work and letting the
negro “root hog or die”, he will
soon come to his master for feed,
and then we can bring him to terms
at our own price. And after we
work him hard all the week he is
not going to fool away much time on
Saturday night in attendance at
these secret meetings, especially if
he has no money. And after a time
the “societies” will go to pieces.
If you have so much- land, stock,
etc., to care for that you are forced
to depend upon negro labor to work
it, then I would suggest that you
either sell off the land to deserving
young white men for homes, or let it
"lay out” for a few years, and sell
Under the Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
off your surplus stock, keeping just
land and stock enough for your own
force, letting Mr. Coon go his way,
and after a little while he will come
and beg you for a job, which you
can give him or her at your own
price and upon your own conditions,
part of said conditions which can be
that he or she is to work from sun
up until dark every day of the week,
and get paid off only on Monday
mornings, and that he or she must
not attend any secret meetings of
any kind at any time, or they lose
their job. And then do not loan or
hire them your horses, mules, wag
ons, buggies, etc., on Sundays. Do
not allow them to hunt on your
land, nor lend or sell them guns, pis
tols, etc. Do not hire any
who keeps a dog. Do not rent them®
your land, but have it worked by®
day labor. Make them do their ownß
cooking and eating. -If you must
hire one of the wenches to cook for
you, then pay her so much per
month for her services, and have it
in the contract that she is not to
carry off anything to eat after she
gets home, and that you will “fire”
her the first time you catch her al
lowing any other negro to enter
your kitchen without your special
permission to do so. If there is any
“cold grub” left over see that that
hog of yours in the pen gets it and
not the cook, to carry home with
her to feed “her man” on so that
he will not be compelled to work the
next day. Do not “pet” the negro
in any way. Soft-soap talk to a ne
gro is only a club for them to knock
you in the head with. Do not talk
foolishness and “run on” with a ne
gro. Say what is necessary to be
said to them, and let them know you
mean every little word of it. Do
not allow “the big boy” of the house
to “hang around” in the kitchen
with the negro “lady” cook. Do not
allow immoral and indecent pictures
of any kind to come into the sight
of any of the Sambo family. Treat
the negro just like you ,pught to
Jeffersonian
That Power, grand, unknowable,
That moves the hand and heart to act,
That guides the sun upon its course,
And keeps the universe intact;
That notes the smallest sparrow's fall.
And counts the hairs upon each head,
That knows man’s darkest secret thought,
And hears each word by mortals said;
I trust to guide my erramt steps
Across the narrow shaft of light,
That man must enter at his birth,
And p>ass across, and into night;
And I am willing it shall guide
My steps in paths of peace or strife,
And feel that it will justice do,
In giving either death or life.
treat a good mule, and always keep
one eye on him, and if he or she
gets the least bit out of the way lay
both of your hands on him or her
and just keep on laying them on un
til he or she hollers “calf rope”.
Whip them a little and they will
“report you to the law”, but whip
them a plenty and they will respect
you.
Some may ask how we are to con
trol the negroes who own their own
land and homes, to which I will say
that this element seldom gives us
any trouble, and is not the class
we have to worry about. We can
let them run their own affairs, so
long as they stay in their place. But
I would advise the white people not
to sell the negroes any more land,
and to buy back from them all that
can be bought, even if we have no
use for it at the present. But we
Faith

will not have a chance of buying
back much land from the negroes,
as you know they do not sell land,
once they get hold of it.
The country merchant is to blame
to a great extent for the impudence
of the negro. Walk into Mr. Mer
chant’s store and “hang around”
there all day and see how nice he
treats Mr. and Mrs. Coon, and hear
the “sugary” talk he -does to them
in order to gain their trade. It is
simply disgusting to a respectable
white man or woman. I do not
accuse all country merchants of this,
but I find that many of them are guil
ty of it. A merchant can sell goods
to a negro and treat him right too,
and do it without leaving the im
pression upon the negro that he or
she is as good as “any poor white
trash”.
Let the white people of this coun
try begin right in their own homes
to solve this everlasting negro ques
tion by fixing up more and better
conveniences around the home so
that we will be enabled to do our
own work and not have to depend
upon the stinking beasts of the fields
for help, and thus throw them upon
their own resources, which will soon
bring them to our own terms. And
in the meantime let us help Mr.
Watson and Governor Vardaman get
laws enacted that will forever put
the negro out of politics and place
him under our control, which we all
know will not only be to our best
interests, but to the best interests of
the negro also.
