ROOSEVELT. THE STRENUOUS.
An esteemed subscriber and friend
-has requested the Caucasian to explain,,
if it can, why Roosevelt i', apparynt','
so wedded to the negro while he claims
$outhcrn consangninity fromh his moth
er's side?
Unfortunately for the people. Roose
velt .is President of the United tates
by an accident: , misfortune. He is as
ahibti us as he ( erralic. I lving
t'tdl the full ciup of power. his thirst
is insatiable lie is a theorist. a niai
of impulse. In his oficial position he
*1ould 1 iroo1k -n opposition and he may
think he owns the American people.
is law and customs of resth ihit are
irksome to him; lie lacks in the ele
ments which made McKinley popular.
Mc(Kigley was a 5nOeoth politician
Rooseveeh is a Rough Rider. He con
iiters theories and discards conditions.
His appointments of negroes ii the
South agauinst the protest of the intel
ligent masses. are political blunders. He
has claimed recognition from the
South through Southern blod. tbut his
unwarranted attack on Jefferson Davis
nitist withhold from him all recognition
of the gallant mne who breasted *the
storms of battle for constitutional lil
erry, and his attitude towards the South
must shear him of his pretense. If he
were to show sympathy or regard for
the South he assumes that the people
of the North would think him disloyal.
His recognition of the negro is in keep
ing with his vagaries and is suggested
for political effect. His every move
nant is based on an inordinate political
atmittirm. He expects to secure the
flomeination for the presidency through
the negro, delegates from the South.
Why should he care for the white peo
ple of the South who being T)emuocrats
ca, give him no political support? His
boast of Southern blood is a Mockery.
Having become President through a na
tional calamity. it is to be hoped that lie
will be retired forever from political
,promine*ce when his term of dtfice has
exptired.

IMMIGRATION LEAGUE.
There is a noticeable feature in the
reports of the proceedings of the Im
migration League. organized in New
Orleans, which is the absence of the
pictures of the prominent gentlemen in
the gathering. Generally on such occa
sions the Picayune . and the Tines
Democrat have vied 'with each other in
the picture gallery line, which, however,
may he reserved as a grand flash light
at the wind-up of the assembly. How
ever, the league has, from reports. or
ganized on practical husiness principles
which may secure results satisfactory in
the future. No sensible man will gain
say the fact that home-seekers and
home-makers are desired. but these do
not move by faith or promise and. must

Golumbia, S. C., Jpn: 21.-After four
days of suffering death came shortly
after 'noon Monday to Marciaeso Gener
Gonzales, editor of the Columbia State.
who was shot last Thursday by Lieu
tenant Governor James H. Tillman. He
was unconscious when the end came.
His wife, his three brothers, his sister.
members of the editorial staff of the
State and the surgeons were present.
Surgeons attribbte the'death of Mr.
Gonzales as shown by the autopsy to
"profound septic inflammation from
gangrenous condition tissue, conse
quent upon bullet wounds."
Coroner Green empanelled a jury.
with Allen Jones, a prominent business
man, as foreman. Mose of the other
members are well known business men
also. The jury viewed the body after
which the inquest was adjourned until
Thursday at 8 p. in., when testimony
will be heard in the county court
room. The body was then taken to tie
residence of Mr. Gonzales, in Hender
son street. Attorney. Coleman L.
Blease, who is said to be one of Col
onel Tillman's lawyers, was present
when the jury was at the hospital, but
took no active part in the proceedings.
Soon after the death of Mr. Gon
sales a telephone message carried the
news to Captain Sligh, the county
jailer, and he apprised Tillman. It is
stated that the latter received the
intelligence *ithout any expression or
betokening any emotion one way or
the other. He was asked if he would
soake a statement and replied through
his brother-in-law, Judge Buchanan,
that he had nothing to say.
When the news that the end had
come was bulletined to Charleston the
flags on the buildings of the News and
Courier and Charleston Post were at
once placed, at half mast.
- Throughout Monday morning hun
dreds of telegrams of sympathy have
poured in not only from communities,
newp; and titizens from all over
South arolina, but from many Ameri
can pi es. north- and south. Among
theih were expressions from Hugh S.
Thompson of New Yoork, ex-governor
of South Carolina, and Gonzalo de
Quesada, the Cuban minister at Wash.
