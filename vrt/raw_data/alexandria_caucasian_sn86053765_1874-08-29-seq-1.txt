A tall "Western girl named Short,
long loved a certain big Mr. Little :
while Little, little thinking of Short
loved a little lass named Long. To
make a long story short, LiUlc pro
posed to Long, and Short longed
to be even with Little's shortcom
ings. So Short, meeting^Long,
threatened to marry Little before
long, which caused Lit^Jc, in a short
time, to marry Long. Query : Did
tall Short love big Little less, be
cause Little loved Loner ?

THIEVES AM) STEALIJP
It makes me hoppin' mad to think
Of all the thieves and steal in*
Among the folks that live so high
And are so big of feeliu'
With hands that do no sort of work
Except to handle money,
And make it come so short o'couut—
It sartin isn't funny.
Tînt bless me! —can't they dress and swell
In lofty style and splendor.
On stealin's that don't sartin make.
Their conscience over tender 1 ?
When they can feel so high above
The smaller thieves and sinners.
Whose lieu-roost, stealin's wouldn't make
One of their plainest dinners.
Folks mostly now begin tor think
Sieh loads o' silks and laces,
And jewels and gran'd carriages,
Means thieving in high places;
And lofty airs don't count for much
In honest people's feelin's,
Who have, ter work for all the cash
They gobble up in stealin's.
They say that. Washington is jist
A den o' thieves together.
Ami they have plucked our eagle bird
Of every quill and feather:
And now they think to make it good
Jiy taxin' us the greater.
When they had orter all be shot
Clean from the realms o' Natur.
II0W TWO IMMORTALS MET.
In Prague there was to be anofh
er of those great musical jubilees
for which the cm pi till of Bohemia
was noted during the last century,
and from every directiun, journey
ed thither, artists and laymen,
either to participate in the exercises,
or to listen; Already, on the day
before the fete, the inns—large and
small—of the city proper, were
overfilled, and the landlords, desi
rous as they were to profit by the
occasion, could not do other than
turn away the later arrivals. Many
were, therefore, compelled to seek
lodging ifr'tto^taverns of the sub
urbs, which were usually patron
ized by people of the lower orders
A young man—a "pianist," said
his passport—from Vienna, had,
like many others, sought lodgings
in all the hotels of the city, with
out success, and finally decided to
go to an inn in one of the suburbs,
where he was told he would proba
bly find very comfortable quarters
and very good fare. The youth
was received by a landlord of a very
surly mien, who, after measuring
him from head to foot with a for
bidding glance, replied that lie
could not accomodate him, "he was
full !" But there was a pretty
young serving girl within hearing
who did not seem at all afraid of
cross-grained old landlord, aud ven
tured to differ with him. :
"Yes, we can accommodate the.
gentleman, too," said she. "There
will be no one in the wine-room this
evening; everybody will be in the
city. It's very easy to make up a
bed for the gentlemen there."
"Do so, for all I care," m utturfd
the landlord, and turned away.
The young pianist decided to re
main, as tl:e girl assured him that
she would sec lie was made com
fortable, and that the landlord wis
not really half so much a bear as he
seemed. She now hastened to pre
pare the evening meal, and the
young musician in the meantime
repaired to the largo room that was
destined to be Uis bed room for the
night. A p the usual v veiling guests
were nut expected, the room had
not been lighted, «but the moot*
shone through the vine bordered
window so as to enable the youth
to see his way, although indistinct
ly. In one corner he discovered a
sofa, on which li*e threw himself in
oider to rest his weary limbs while
waiting supper. He had been there
but a few minutes when the door
opened and a man entered, who
walked to the farther and darker
end of tiie room, with a certainty
of step that showed he was not a
stranger to the apartment. A min
ute afterward, the youth heard the
tones of piano—at first a few ao
cords, then a melody, a wild melo
dy, that might liave been likened
to a chorus of Angels. The youth
partially rose from the sofa, and
listened as one who would catch
the faintest sound. How radiant
was every feature of his face with
ecstatic delight! This improvisa
tion, this heavenly improvisation,
seemed to transport him into an
other and higher sphere ! There
was but one—only one—who could
produce such harmony, and to see
and hear him was the chief object
of the youth's journey. He rose
and walked on tiptoe over toward
the piano, in order, if possible, to
see the performer. The tones grew
softer and sotter, aud they finally
died away.
The finale was divinely beautiful,
and held the youthful enthusiast
spell bound until the master him
self roused him from his reverie.—
The latter, when he had finished
playing, rose, went toward the sofa,
and threw himself upon it appar
cully fatigued. As the light of the
moou fell on his face, theyouth saw
he had before him an elderly matt
of a peculiarly noble and benevo
lent mien.- Seeing that lie had not,
as yet, been observed, an idea sud
denly occured to him, and ho seat
ed himself noiselessly at the piano.
Again the instrument was made to
utter its sweetest tones, and the
man on the sota listened in pro
found admiration. He saw no one,
but he heard, and what he leard
was sufficient to rivet his entire at
tention. How pure the tones come
from this niaster hand, the listener
on the sofa quickly discovered.—
The joys of a youthful heart seemed
to find : utterance in the first ac
cords of the young musician. Then
gradually, the tones became deeper,
the passions and trials ot a large—
struggling nature, spoke in full and
sorrowful accovds, until they be
came' the cry of bitter despair.—
What /uusic it was! The older
musician clatped his hands across
his -breast apd ' listened with his
whole soul. He knew of but one
composer who was capable ot pro
ducing such music, and it was
mainly in"the hope of meeting him
that he had come to the fete. He
i
was confident the virtuaso before
him must be lie, and he only. Fin
ally, he arose aud noiselessly ap
proached the piano, until he stood
behind the performer, who was so
absorbed that lie neither saw nor
'treard him. At least, ho too, ceas
ed playing. He struck the last ac
cord, and sank back exhausted.—
At that moment a hand was laid on
his shoulder, while another took
him by the arm and led him toward
the window, where the light of the
inoon would fall full upon his face.
An elderly mad, his eyes beaming
with delight, gazed at him a mo
ment and then cried, in a tone that
betrayed deen emotion: "Mozart !"
"Haydn !" responded the young
man, in an accent not less joyous.
Thus met, tor the first time, these
two immortal composers, whose
greatest wish had long been to know
each other.

MARRIED ACROSS A RIVER.
a good joke on a kentucky bri
dal party—"do it quick,
squire."
From the St. Louis Republican.
A Cannelton, Ind., Justice of the
Peace, has lately performed a mat
rimonial feat which entitles him to
the kind regard and business con
sideration of every pair of closely
pursued and hotly pressed lovers
in the world. Cannelton is one
of Kentucky's convenient Gretna
Greens—much the better aud safer
for being in another State, with
the sweet-flowing Ohio between.
Cannelton is so used to young run
aways that the couples are never
noticed any more, unless they have
a notable history. A couple of this
kind sought the sweets ot Cannel
ton the other day, and got into the
papers.
A pretty* little Kentucky girl
was loved by two brothers. She
was not able to decide between
them, and left the question with
themselves to settle. They met
one day on their way to the house
of the lady, and commenced the ar
gument of which was the best man
in the old Kentucky style of oft'
with your coat and at it—pellmell,
rough-and-tumble—buff, and come
again. While they were thus dis
cussing their relative merits, and
both g-itting very tired of the de
bate, another young fellow who had
no fraternal rival, slipped into the
house, told of the disgraceful scene
in progress between the brothers,
and asked the young lady to split
the difference and get lijj of the
ruffians by taking him. The pic
ture he painted her was so bright
that she took hiin at his word and
both hastened to make tracks out
of tiie State. They hied them to
the river and on the way en^geil
a holy man of Hawsville to come
over as quick as he could aifd
bring his weddiwg ceremonial out
fit for tUeireverl istiiig'bcnefit. He
reed to skiff ove v the river in a
short time and told . <*m to go be
as happy as the^*c - Ai«|__^intil he
came. They crosse"Qr Jv-"to Can
nelton and bastene, "l'ocure the
necessary wedding document by
the laws of Indiana made,and prtf?
vided lor such ventures. They got
it and were walking hand in hand
just outside the gates of Eden,
waiting for them to swing open
with silver music and admit them
to still forbidden joys.
There was just enough fear of
pursuit to make it lively for their
young hearts, and cause them to
tremble a little on the brink of
blessedness. They came to Castle
berry bridge over a rippling stream
which was too wide to jump, and
too ^eep to wade. The bridge
was" uude^feoing repairs, and a
large portion of the lloor was torn
up. They stopped and looked into
the gulf below through to* bare
beams. They gazed over* f o the
Kentucky shore and saf^.a. boat
full of m-;n rowing across with
steady stroke. Pursued! That
was the first thought. What was
to be done ? They would petish
together rather than be torn asun
der. Hand in hand they advanc
ed one step nearer the gulf, before
taking the fatal plunge through
the gaping bridge beams. A mo
ment more, and they would have
been safe from pursuit, and locked
in each others arms at the pebbly
bottom of the stream. They heard
a voice cry : " Hold ! rash, impetu
ous children." They looked up and
saw the smiling face ot Squire Pat
terson like a rising sun on the other
side of the bridge. They kn^w him
'
in their calmer, happier days. The
young lady was on the most iut\
mate footiug with the Squire, and
she very naturally took the posi
tion of spokesman. She halloed
across, " Squire marry us quick !"
At the same time pointing to the
boat advancing with now audibly
splashing oars. The squire took iu
the situation in a twinkling, aud
shouted, " AU right, send on your
papers." The young man picked
up a handy boulder aud tying the
license to it with his handkerchief,
flung it across, while the young wo
man was crying at the top of her
voice, " Here they come ! They
are ready to land ! Do it quick
Squire !" The squire did it quick
and shouted the marriage ceremony
across the water and bridged the
yawning chasm with safety for
those two willing hearts aud young
lives so very near the brink. He
ended, " I pronounce you man aud
wife. Go aud tell 'em, what God
hath joined together let no man
burst asunder. Young man, tie a
dollar to another dornick and heave
it over."
That little matter was all settled
nicely, and the young couple breath
ed again. They were married and
proclaimed man and wife so quick
that it made their heads swim
They could now dare life, and brave
all the world ; especially their ea
ger pursuers, who had landed from
the boat. They turned toward the
skift passengers with proud defi
ance, and suddenly came to their
sober senses. The boat brought
over the holy man of Hawsville,
whom they had engaged to marry
them, and his party, and the young
couple felt a slight color of shame
in their faces.

forming this duty she immediately
boarded the cars and eloped with a

where the nuptial knot was drawn
in a lovely bow-knot, and the hap

The newly-made bride alighted from

Sometime since the editor of tïie
Colorado Herald had occasion to
leave town for a lew days, and en
trusted bis own organ to the care
ot a novice in journalism, instruct
ing him to pile it on as thick as be
could whenever he had a chance to
advertise the Herald. He then
went away, and the following night
his wife died very suddenly. This
is bow the assistant editor men
tioned the circumstances :
Gone, but not Forgotten.—
We are compelled this morniug to
perform a duty wbicb is peculiarly
painful to the able assistant editor
who has been engaged on this pa
per at an enormous expense, iu ac
cordance with our determination to
make the Herald a first-class jour
ual. Last night death unexpected
ly snatched away from our domes
tic hearth (the best are advertised
under the head of stoves and furn
aces, upon our first page,) Mrs. Ag
atha P. Burns, wife of Rufus P.
Burns, the gentlemanly editor of
tiie Herald. (Terms three dollars
a year, invariably in advance.) A
kind mother and exemplary wife.
(Office over Coleman's grocerv, up
two flights of stairs ; knock hard.)
"We shall miss thee, mother ; we
shall miss thee." (Job printing so
licited.) Funeral at four aud a half
o'clock, from the house just across
the street from the Herald office.—
(Advertisements inserted for tcu
cents per square.)
But his efforts were not appre
ciated, and the Post and Mail re
lates the sequel of the story with
sorrow : The editor arrived home
that day at noon. Slowly and sad
ly ho was observed to arm himself
with a double barrelled fowling
piece, iuto which he inserted about
two pounds and a half of bullets.'
He marched over io the office, fol
lowed by an immense crowd. Tho
assistant editor was-bu^y iu paint
ing a big placard to be tacked on
the hearse. It bore the legend, "Buy
your coffins of Simme,.oyer the Her
ald office." The assistant editor
cast his eye around und perceived
his chief. Care sat upon that wan
chcek and thunder clothed his
brow. He leveled his gun. The
assistant did not wait. With ono
wild an . ful yell he jumped from
the »id-story window, and
strr r .. for the golden shores of
the Pacitf&T, It is,believed he event
ually went? över'to China.
New Probabilities.
When yon see a man going homo
at two o'clock in tho morning, and
know his wife is waiting up for him,
it is likely to be stormy.
When a man receives a bill for
goods his wife bought unknown to
im, look out for thunder aud light

When a man goes home and finds
no supper ready, the fire out, and
bis wife crusading, it is likely to be
cloudy.
When a man promises to take his
wife to a party, and changes his
mind after she is dressed, you may
expect a shower.
When a man saves his cigar mon
ey to buy his wife a bonnet and his
children new shoes, it indicates a.

When a man dies and leaves a

money, and you see her walking
