OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
HAD TO HAVE A KNIFE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Papa received
his Watson knife and is highly pleas
ed with it. I like the knife so well
that I am determined to have one,
too, so I started out to get a sub
scriber for the Magazine. Please
send me a Watson knife for my pre
mium. I am nine years old. I go
to school every day. My teacher got
hurt in a street car wreck last Satur
day. She is getting along nicely.—
Yours truly, Blanden McJunkin, Box
172, Wheatland, Pa.
SHE WRITES WELL.
Dear Daddy Jim:—My aunt takes
The Jeffersonian and I like to read
the boys’ and girls’ letters. This is
my first attempt to write; but I can’t
write much, I have had such a poor
chance to learn. My father has been
dead five years. I have four broth
ers, and I am the oldest one. My
mother and we all live with grand
ma, and she is a widow too. 1 am
twelve years old. I have four broth
ers. We have to walk two miles and
a half to school. I love my teacher.
Her name is Miss Annie Skinner. We
had a nice time celebrating George
Washington’s birtday. I will answer
Flora McClelland’s riddle: It is a
watermelon. Mattie Patrick’s is, (1)
a dirt-dauber; (2) is a wasp. Nola
Melear’s is father and son. I will
close, with love to Mr. Watson and
all who read The Jeffersonian.- -
Annie Dozier, Rt. 2, Box 13, Blythe,
Georgia.
THIS LETTER HOPPED OUT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again to join your happy band. I
have written twice before, but I guess
my letters hopped into the waste
basket. My father takes The Jeffer
sonian and Magazine. I surely do
enjoy reading the children’s page. I
think Mr. Watson is a great man. I
will answer two of Carlyle Giles’ rid
dles; One is a bed, and the other is
somebody churning. I am thirteen
years of age. I go to school every
day I can. My teacher’s name is Miss
Laura Stevenson. I think Daddy Jim
is Mr. Watson. I hope to see my let
ter in print. I will close, with best
wishes to The Jeffersonian and its
many readers. —Your new friend,
Cicero Nunnally, Rt. 1, Baldwin, Ga.
A LONG RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little Alabama girl to join your Post-
Card Club. I am seven years old.
Have been going to school this win
ter. My teacher’s name is Miss Nettie
Ashcraft. She is a good teacher and
we all love her. lam in the second
reader. I will send a riddle: to the
first one answering it, I will send a
pretty card: “Sometimes I am on
water; sometimes I am on land.
Sometimes I am lying; sometimes I
stand. Sometimes I am moving;
sometimes I am. still. Sometimes I
defy you; sometimes at your will.
Sometimes I am short; sometimes I
am long. Sometimes with the old;
sometimes with the young. Some
times in the day; sometimes in the
night. Sometimes I amuse; some
times I affright. Though you touch
me, yet feel me you can’t, if you try;
then answer, dear reader, and say
what am I”. —Mildred Jeffrey, Fay
ette, Ala.
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING.
Dear Daddy Jim:—We take The
Jeffersonian and Magazine and I en
joy reading the Post-Card Club so
much. We are living in hopes of Mr.
Watson publishing a daily paper. Ger
trude Long, I don’t think that all the
girls will form themselves in clubs,
and not have anything to do with
boys that smoke; but I think it
would be a good thing for girls and
boys also. The answer to Flora Mc-
Clelland’s riddle is a watermelon. I
am going to look for my post-card
now. I will close, as ever your friend
Bbe. "Jeffersonian
wishing much success to Daddy Jim,
and the Post-Card Club.—Vinnie
Wallace, 451 Billups St., Athens, Ga.
HERE’S A BRIGHT LETTER.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Goodness gra
cious! lam here, like Johnney on
the spot. Gee! children, you all sure
do ask funny riddles. But, look
here, I want the one that asked that
riddle about the featherless fowl,
and that one about the apple tree,
to answer them. I will answer
some: Nora Melear’s is, the boy’s
uncle. I reckon it is right; if it
isn’t, don’t laugh at it. Edna Amos’
is a watermelon. Mattie Patrick’s
is sunshine, and the other one is a
dirt-dauber. Say, Daddie Jim, it is
not too late to have another con
test. Let us write on one of these
subjects: Atmosphere, water, sun,
moon or Mother Nature; aren’t
these fine? Well, I know you will be
tired of such foolishness. You all
answer this: As I went over to St.
Ives, I met a man with nine wives,
each wife had a sack, each sack had
a cat, each cat had a kitten; how
many were going to St. Ives? No. 2,
Thomas Tee Tatamus tied two tubs
to two tall trees, how many T’s in
that? —Eula Roberts, Tazewell, Ga.
A GOOD FIRST ATTEMPT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
girl, twelve years old. I go to
school every day I can. My teach
er’s name is Miss Mae Snider; I like
her very much. I am in the fifth
grade. My papa takes The Jeffer
sonian, and I enjoy reading the chil
dren’s pages. Papa thinks there is
no other paper like The Jeffersonian.
He is a Tom Watson man from head
to foot. I hope to see my letter in
print, as this is my first attempt. I
will ask a riddle: “Love I sit; love
I stand; love I hold fast in my hand;
yet he is dead, can not see, but his
eyes are placed on me.” What is
smaller than an ant’s mouth? To
the boy or girl that answers these
riddles I will send a pretty post
card. The answer to Warren Wat
son’s is a man named Horn, and he
ate a piece of horn. He was going
to be hung, and they told him if he
would get a riddle that they could
not unriddle, they would set him
free; and he did so. Best wishes to
The Jeffersonian.— Annie Cheely, Rt.
3, Mitchell, Ga.
FROM MISSISSIPPI.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you please
make room in your happy band for
a Mississippi girl? My father takes
The Jeffersonian, and I enjoy reading
our Post-Card Club so much. I have
brown eyes, black hair, fair com
plexion. Will be sixteen years old
the third of March. Will some of
you cousins send me a Post-Card Club
for a birthday present? Will answer
Nora Melear’s riddle: The boy in jail
was the man’s son. Flora McClel
land’s riddle was a watermelon. Will
ask one: Humpty Dumpty sat on a
wall; Humpty Dumpty had a great
fall; all the tories in the world could
not put Humpty Dumpty up again.
If any of you answer my riddle, will
send you a card. And if I answered
the others right, would like to re
ceive a card. I guess I had better
close, as this is my first attempt, and
I am getting afraid of the waste
basket.—Your little cousin, Lee
Ware, Duck Hill, Miss.
TWO KENTUCKY RIDDLES.
Dear Daddy Jim:—My brother
takes The Jeffersonian, and I like to
read the childrens’ page very much.
I am a little girl, eight years old;
have light hair and blue eyes. I have
four brothers and five sisters. I like
to go to school. I have two little
cousins visiting me now, and we have
a fine time playing blindfold. I will
answer Nola Melear’s riddle: The
friend in prison was the man’s son.
The answer to Flora McClelland’s is
a watermelon. The answer to Mat
tie Patrick’s is sunshine. Now I will
ask some: Once there was a man
went out to view the skies, and he
had no eyes; but he saw an apple
tree that had apples on it. He took
no apples off and left no apples on.
What makes a Dutchman build his
hog pen on the hillside? To the
first one that answers this, I will
send a post-card. I will close, with
best wishes to the many readers. —
Lavada Stafford, Moulton, Ky.
FROM A GEORGIA BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim:—ls there room
in your happy band for a Georgia
boy ten years old, with blue eyes; a
lover of books and papers. My papa
takes The Jeffersonian and likes it
fine. All of the family like the
grand paper. We do hurrah for Hon.
Thos. E. Watson. We are so glad to
know of a grand, brave man, who
will claim for his people their rights.
Carlyle Giles’ riddle is a wheel. The
sheep are five and seven. Flippety
flop is a churn. —Your Georgia friend,
S. D. McKay, Lyons, Ga.
GOT SOME SUBSCRIBERS FIRST.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. Would have written before
now, but wanted to get some sub
scribers to the Jeffersonians before I
wrote (again. I have three for the
Magazine and nine for the weekly, as
you will find on the enclosed sheets.
I have the promise of some more
later on. Papa says the Jeffersonians
get better all the time, and I think so,
too. The answer to Carlyle Giles’
first riddle is five and seven. Easter
Matthews’ must be the whale that
swallowed Jonah. Nola Melear’s:
the man that was talking to the
jailer was the prisoner’s father. With
best wishes to you and the Jeffer
sonians, I am your little friend, Belle
Smith, Rt. 8, Rome, Ga.
