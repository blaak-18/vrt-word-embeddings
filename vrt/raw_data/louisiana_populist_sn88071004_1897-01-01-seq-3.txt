Vrooman-Scott.
e Bride Given Away by Vice Presi
s dent Stevenson.
St. Louis Mo., Dec., 28.-Prob
ably the most notable social even
of the season in St. Louis was the
wedding this evening of Miss Ju
lia Scott to Mr. Carl Vrooman, of
2 Baltimore, at the residence of the
bride's sister, Mrs. Chas. S. Brom
i well, No. 4102 Westminster place. I
Rev. Frank B. Vrooman, of Chica
Ce o, a brother of the groom, was the
officiating clergyman. The bride
is a (ldaughter of the late Matthew
T. Scott, of Lexington, Ky., and
- a neice of Vice President Adial E. i
a Stevenson. Mr. Vrooman, a Har- t
vard graduate and ex-president of c
the Intercollegate Debating Socie- e
- tv, is one of the six Vrooman c
brothers who are well known as
orators. Vice President Steven- a
son gave thelbride away. A recep- a
tion followed the conclusion of the c
wedding ceremony, at which quite t
-a number of prominent people i
were present. A few guests from a
out of the city were Vice Presi- i
dent and Mrs. Stevenson, MrS.
Louis Y. Stevenson and Miss Jane v
Fuller, daughter of Chief Justice
Fuller, all of Washington, D. C,; b
Mr. and Mrs. John C. Black and
daughter, of Chicago; Miss Nan- 1
hie Barbee, of Danville, Ky.; Miss i
Evelyn Brown, of Louisville, and
Miss Marian Lindsley, of Frank
fort, Ky,--Times-Democrat. I
One of the six brothers above f
referred, Rev. H. C. Vrooman,
lectured in the Court-house here
about Syears ago. His theme was
socialism, and he told us that he
was a Populist until a party more
strongly socialistic was organized.
These brothers all agree in po. I
litics, and it is strange that Vice c
Presikent Stevenson is mixing up li
with such fanatics.
