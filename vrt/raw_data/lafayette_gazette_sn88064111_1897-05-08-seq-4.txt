A Generous Offer.
Mr. Lengsfield, of the firm of S.

of this parish. He proposes to
turn over the management of the
refinery to them provided that they
take $to,ooo worth of shares in the

formed. Whether or not Mr.
Lengsfield succeeds in organizing a
stock company the refinery will be
operated this season and the pro
