The Channels of Commerce
From the crude, rude days of pion
eer barter and exchange, when the
skins of fur-bearing animals were a
medium of exchange, and local con
sumption limited the market to the
needs of the community, commerce
has grown, through the agencies of
improved transportation, necessitated
by the wants of eighty millions of
people, until, like a mighty river, the
products of the producer flow to the
consumer, in vast volume, with a
force of current that floats the com
mercial world and turns the wheels
of our industrial system.
The great stream of commerce
flows from the producer to the con
sumer along a narrow, crooked
course, a canon faced with granite
crags, where the products of the
world run gamut, where those who
help to make the course straight and
smooth are few, and those who block
its movement and pervert its current
are many.
The wealth of the world flows in
the channel of commerce. From it
all men are fed, clothed and support
ed, in idleness or industry. The pro
ducer is the first source. Out of
what he produces he feeds himself
and all the rest of the world. It is
the business of commerce to distrib
ute the product, to leave the producer
a living, not too sumptuous, and dis
tribute the rest to the balance of the
world, taking due toll in payment for
the service of distribution thus ren
dered.
It is to the interest of the world
to distribute the products of the pro
ducer to the consumer with the great
est efficiency and economy, but com
merce has considered it to its own
advantage to make the system eat up
as near all the product, in the process
of distribution, as is practical, leav
ing the producer only what natural
necessity requires, and delivering to
the consumer only the bare substance
of life. All the products, in excess of
the bare necessities, are used up
along the channel of commerce,
where the parasites feed land wax
fat.
Along this channel of commerce
there are pirates who hold up the
products of labor and take tariff, as
little as they must, as much as they
may. The human beasts of pray are
here, the vultures and the jackals
and the wolves, each with his toll
gate, extracting what he can from
the groat life-sustaining stream, and
the only excuse for these numerous
holdups, is that the pirates are dis
tributing the products of the pro
per to the consumer. Under the
present system, it takes about nine
toll gates to accomplish this distri
bution, and only about one-tenth of
the product reaches the end of the
channel and is handed out to the
consumer in general. Thus the pro
ducer must support nine men before
he can feed himself.
The distribution of products is very
necessary, but there is something rad
ically wrong with the system that
swallows up nine-tenths of the prod
uct in the process. There are too
many leaks in the channel. The
system of distribution is unnecessa
rily expensive. Too many profits
have been added to the price of
everything sold. The essential cost
of distribution is very small; the
necessary agents, few. But if dis
tribution is effected with economy
and without great waste, the para
sites would be out of a job; de
prived of their toll gates, they would
have to turn producers or starve.
The pretext by which they secured a
living at the expense of the producers
would be gone.
Many of the parasites work as hard
in competing with one another as the
producers do, only they produce noth
ing and are a dead loss to society.
If the energy expended by the para
sites, the superfluous agents of distri
bution, w r as usefully employed, the
burden of the producer would be
lightened, and the activities of the
parasite not increased, simply by the
utilization of what is now unproduc
tive effort.
The trusts and corporations are
showing us how to minimize the cost
of production and distribution. At
the present time this is done for the
gain of the few, but some day, when
we have learned the lesson, it will be
turned to the advantage of the
many.
The man who produces has to sup
port every other man who does not
produce, as well as himself. There
are a few items of human service
as important as production, but the
day of fake service is doomed, the
unessential is speedily stricken out.
The body politic can not be truly
healthy until every parasite has been
usefully employed.

Letters From the People
(Concluded from Page Seven)
THE TARIFF IS NOT UNDER
STOOD.
Dear Sir:—lnclosed please find one
dollar, for which renew my subscrip
tion, and send premium knife. I do
not care for the knife for its value,
but want it to show to people and
try to get some subscriptions for your
publications. Some people want to
be sure they are getting their money’s
worth before you can get them to do
anything, and this place is full of
rock-ribbed Republicans, who don’t
know why they vote that way,—only
it Dad voted that way.
Well, we have some ivell-posted
ones here. This is a druggist’s idea
on the tariff. He says if a man pays
six dollars tariff on a suit, the man
that imported it paid it, and did not
add it to the cost of suit and make
it twelve dollars! He laughed at the
idea of the manufacturers adding the
amount of tariff to homemade stuff!
I told him not only that, but two or
three times as much as the tariff on
lots of things. Then he got mad and
said they ought to put a high tariff
on mail-order houses. The Smart
Alex did not seem to realize that
they get it in the neck as well as ev
erybody else.
While Congress was at work on the
tariff bill, I would ask these old
moss-backers about it, and what they
thought of it, and they would say that
they didn’t know, —that they didn’t
keep well posted. Well, well, —is it
any wonder that the monopolists can
do as they please when that class of
©be 3effersonian
men do the voting,—as there are
more of this kind than there are of
those who keep posted? I can’t go
to the twins, and there is no sense or
reason in Socialism, so on election
day I have my fun with all of them,
as there is not another Populist in
this neighborhood.

HOW A SOUTH CAROLINA JUDGE
DID.
Dear Sir:—l have just read, with
interest, what you say about Judge
Broyles fining a gentleman for strik
ing the man who insulted his wife.
I agree with you. I wish to call your
attention to what Judge R. C. Watts,
of South Carolina, did under similar
circumstances.
Judge Watts is a judge of the court
of general sessions, which corre
sponds with your superior court on
its criminal side. He is as able and
learned judge as has presided in our
courts in her past history. His rec
ord for being affirmed by our Su
preme Court has never been surpass
ged in the State. He is a common
pleas judge also.
The case was this: A negro woman
had given a white baby a whipping
with a switch. When the husband of
the white lady learned the fact, he
took a brush and gave the negro wo
man a severe whipping. The negro
woman indicted the white man for
an assault and battery of a high and
aggravated nature. He came into
court like a man and told Judge
Watts what he had done and entered
a plea of guilty. In passing sentence,
Judge Watts said, in substance:
“Mr. , stand up. I am glad to
make your acquaintance. I am proud
("foreign missions exposed!
