others WI helre allIt-bex stuffin, is
not tolerated, and the Populists I
hold the Ibalance of ower.
lBut lhcre in ,oui.isiana, w here the
"machine" holds the balance of t
lpower, and Fostel ism relegates the
silver question or any other vexing
matter "to the domain of national
politics," it is a little surprising
to witness the 1)emQlrats lOgging
the Populists for fusion.
Only last Winter the Populists
in I)eSoto parish were barred from
a Democratic primary, while the
negro was admulitted to full privi
leges therein.
Only last Spring these Iopulists
were Republlicans (Foster said
I there could l be t two parties) and
the allies of negroes, because they
insisted on having silver in their
State platform and fought the
crowd that elected Catfrey to the
U. S. Senate.
Only last April the State militia,
ra Gatling gin anti as many l)emo
crats as could be fooled into should
eI ring a musket were brought up
against these Populists because for
sooth, they demanded an honest
I count of their votes.
Now they want these same votes
a they refused to count less than six
months ago-want these same votes
that were not as good as a negroe's
s in the late campaign.
But what do they want with
them I
I Six short months ago the Demo
crats had enough votes, so the re
turns say, to beat all the Republi
cans, all the Populists and nearly
all the silver Democrats, solidly
united.
What has become of them ! They
got most of the silver Democrats
back. The Republicans are off af
ter McKinley, and the Populists
are not with them. So the oppo
sition to Democracy is not united
as it was last April, but is occupy
ing the other 3 quarters of the po
htical sphere.
f Surely it isn't that said Demo
crats need votes! Where is the
"machine" ? Does it not yet hold
the balance of power IHas Fos
ter lost his cunning, and thg ballot
box stuffer his craft ?
Surely then is Satan chained in
the bottomless pit, and the milleni
um begun !
We do not believe it.

Mr. 11. L. Irian, Chairman,
NatchitocheQ, Ia.,
D)ear Sir:-We, a Sub-Coinmmit
I~4 c appoiiIted Iy the Democratic
('nilpaign ('on:nuittee \vith full
powers of said l comllittee, request
that you as ('hairman of a commit
tee appointed by the Populist Con
vention at Alexandria, call your
co)illmmittee to=tether to meet this
committee at Shreveport, La., or
any other point that your coimmit
tee may prefer, on Sept. 1st, or at
such other date as you may sug
gest for the purpose of agreeing on
one set of Electors, compiosed puart
ly of Democrats and partly of
P1opulists, in order to in-ure the
casting ot every Silver vote for
one set of electors, thereby making
sure the success of MIr. Bryan in
the State.
An early reply will olbligc,
Yours truly,
J. M3. Foster, Chairman.
(Geo. II. Ellis.
W. W. Heard.

J. T. McLellan.
R. B. Milling.
The speci:al committee referred
to in the above letter was created
and its powers limited by the fol
lowing resolution of our State
convention at Alexandria, Augi
4th.
Resolved, that a commnittee of 1
from each Congressional I)istrict,
and 2 at large he selected by this
convention, with the chairman of
the State Central Committee as ex
officio chairman of the same, which
shall be authorized to make such
changes in the electoral ticket put
I up by this convention as may be
come necessary by any action of
Sthe national committee of the Peo
ple's party.
Realizing that we were without
power to grant the request of the
committee, we hesitated, and con
sulted many Populists as to assum
ing undue authority to t fect an
honorable union of the silver forces.
After a second letter from the
chairman of the I)emocratic com
mittee urging a reply we sent the
following :
Aug. 31st, 1;91i.
Mr. J. MI. Foster, Chairman,
Shreveport, La.
D ar Sir :-The letter of your
committe dated August 22,ad, al
so yours dlated 29:th August, refer
I ring to same, was received by me
and duly considered.
I should have answered your
committee letter earlier, I,,ut for
the fact that the object for whch
you ask me to call the c(:Imittee
- over which I have the honor to
preside, is not within the powers
delegated to said committee, hence
I have been contsulting with mew
b hers of the committee and leading
men in my party before assuming
, such questionable authority.
I find the universal sentiment
amonZ Louisiana Populists to be
Bryan and Watson, and they will
s not .e satisfied with a division of
t eloctors that means nothing to
Watson.
If Mr. Sewall were out of the
way there would he no trouble to
Sget our respective parties to agree
- on an electoral, but it is certain
Sthat Populists in this State will
never support an electoral ticket
the majority or any other part of
e which is pledged to Sewall for
5 Vice President.
SAllow me therefore to suggest
a that you and your committee di
, rect your efforts to securing the
withdrawil of Mr. Sewall as the
surest means of getting Populist
esupport.for your ticket, which will
then be our ticket.
Believing and hoping that this will
Sbe accomplished in the next few
, weeks, and that our conference
Sconmmittees will then have common
Sground to work upon, I will esy
that the special committee which
e u ask to meet, will be convened
Alexandria, on Thursday, Sep
s tomber 24th, at 10:30 a. m., and
Swill be pleased to meet your com
mittee, provided Mr. Sewall has
been induced to withdraw, or your
a committee be authorized to pledge
e the entire ticket we may agree up
T on to support Bryan and Watson.

\VtWest, w\here th re ha. Ibeen a ii
vision of 4(4ctor's, with ':ari ex
c(ptions, as in W ashin,_,lll anst( Ot.
et'Zn, the lPollist fusion electors
have announced their prlp()se of
voting for Scwall as well as Bryan,
and there do not appelar to be mollre
than a dzen fusion electors who
will cast their vot4ts for Watsoen.
The only chance of the litter ma
kin,, any showing is for the Popu
lists to carry sonme of the South
ern Statcs, where there are full
Populist IBryan and \\ats' n electo
ral tickets as oppose, l to the t)eim
ocratic Bryan :and Sewall tickets,
and this chance is very pioor.
There is every reason for hIe
believing that the I)emocrats will
_et the full benetit ,f fusion, and
that the greatt bulk of the Popu
list vote of the country, more than
a million strong, will he cast for
Bryan and Sewall.
We have all alonr uirge-l that
the Democrats intended to swallow
the People's party, force its retrll
hers to vote for that (;o1 l-ihu , cor
lpration protectioni-t, Mr. pctwll,
and now they get so bold as to a:c
knowledge it.
What goodi, pray, would two or
three electors on the ticket do us u
They are simply instruments to
cast our vote for us, and it would
be cast for a straight Democratic
ticket.
Every Populist who votes that
ticket is a backslider, a sow return
ing to her wallow, a dog to his
vomit.
Aye, he shall be likened to the
man who left his house of sin, but
returning, found it swept and gar
nished (free silver and promises,)
and he went and brought seven
other devils (free silver Republi
cans) to live with him, and the last
end of that man was worse than be
fore he had iepented.
"The only chance for the latter
(Watson) is for the Populists to
carry some of the Southern
States," says the Times-Democrat.
Ah, that's it, is it.
Well then, the sensible thing for
Populists to do is to just put some
of those Southern States in doubllt,
and perhaps we'll get our rights.
The Populists can put Louisiana
in very much doubt, and they will
(1do it if Scwall is not taken off the
ticket.
Speaking of Alabama, Georgia
and Louisiana, the Times-l)emo
crat says. "The Democrats will
get nearly all of the Populist votes
where they are needed." Nobody
t except an experienced ballot-box
stuffer could say that with such a
fdegree of assurance.

You'll Laugh
If You Read
This funny and instructive book
tells in a most humorous way how
the Angel of Liberty took Grover
Cleveland from the White House
in the dead of night, and left him,
ragged and hungry, in Oklahoma
City, to tramp home. Grover's
trial's and tribulations as a tramp
are most ludicrously related, and
his conversations with farmers
and laboring men about the silver
question are very instructive.
Everybody Should Read It.
It contains 17d; paes of laugh
provoking matter, and 40 full-paze
illustrations of Cleveland as a
trapsp.
