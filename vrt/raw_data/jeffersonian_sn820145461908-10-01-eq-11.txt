Epilepsy,
Fits
Convulsions, or Spasms
and St. Vitus’ Dance are
Nervous Diseases. Most
cases can be cured by
strengthening and build
ing up the nervous system.
To dp this a nerve medi
cine is needed. Dr. Miles’
Nervine will be found
efficacious and satisfac
tory. It has cured many
cases of these diseases
and we believe it will
cure you. We can give
you names of many who
-have been cured through
its use. Write for advice.
JMy son John had epilepsy for years,
and after having him treated by
specialists for over 2 years he still
continued to have spells. I had al
most given up in despair, but' know
ing the virtue of Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain
Fills for sick headache, I concluded to
try the Nervine. During June, 1906 I
gave him a teaspoonful three times’ a
day, then in July I gave it as directed,
a j 1 could see that he was improving,
and he has not bad a spell since
August 28, 1906, and has taken no
medicine since Jan,-07. I am writing
the case just as it is hoping it will
induce others to try it.”

commercial relations with one another
as well as with the gold standard
countries. International agreement is
a delusion and it is folly to even think
about it, for many good reasons.
‘‘The fact is, a great wrong was
perpetrated upon all producers when
silver was struck down and the most
severe blow was struck by the Cleve
land democratic administration. But
this wrong should and must be
righted no matter who opposes it,
there is no other way out of the pres
ent difficulty in our trade relations
with silver standard countries or in
competing against them in the mar
kets of Europe.
“If we coin all the gold and silver
we can produce into money we will
still be far short of enough money to
meet the increasing demands of com
merce and progress. The same fact
and principle applies to the commer
cial progress of all other countries in
the world.
“The opposition to the righting’ of
this great wrong comes from the finan
cial manipulators of this and other
countries who want a scientific cur
rency, which means a currency that
they ean control the volume of by
manipulation to create panics or flush
times at will, for they cannot control
(only in a very limited way) the
gold and silver money put in circula
tion except by putting up dollar for
dollar for it.
“The people are gradually begin
ning to understand this phase of the
silver question, many men of influ
ence and ability are now giving it
serious consideration. It was ably
presented to the house committee on
banking and currency by Mr. Frewen
last winter, which may account for
the appointment of a commission by
the house to report a plan to revise
our currency system, but any plan
submitted through the influence of
the financial manipulators of this
country will be shorn of all provis
ions that would be most beneficial to
the masses.—Deadwood Daily Pioneer-
Citizen, Deadwood. S. Dakota.
NOTES ABOUT CARTER’S OATS.
Don’t forget that it takes more votes
to elect “than Carter had oats.’’ —
Hartwell, Ga., Sun.
W. Yancey Carter for governor of
Georgia. That don’t sound right no
way—and is not right. “Little Joe”
has the thing won. —Vidalia, Ga., Ad
vance.
Some of the Atlanta papers could
find no better way to defeat Yancey
Carter than by lambasting Hon. Jo
seph M. Brown over somebody else’s
shoulders.—Fort Gaines, Ga., Sentinel.
Mr. Yancey Carter, candidate for
governor of Georgia, of the Independ
ence League party, has already arous
ed opposition in his party household.
—Tallapoosa, Ga., Journal.
Yancey Carter has at different
times been a member of the Democrat
ic, Republican, Populist and all other
parties, and has never amounted to a
Sfye
hill of beans in any of them.—Wal
ton, Ga., Tribune.
Who is going to vote for Yancey
Carter, anyhow? Surely none of those
who voted in the primary last June. —
Dublin, Ga., Times.
Yancey Carter is out for governor
on the independent ticket. Assuming
that those who voted in the democrat
ic primary will stand by the nomina
tion, there are not enough votes left
to give anybody a show. —Effingham
County, Ga., News.
sancey Carter looks pretty well,
from the portraits published of him,
but it will take a man with more than
good looks to walk away with enough
votes from the democracy to elect him
over the nominee.—Cartersville, Ga.,
News.
Col. W. Y. Carter, the independence
candidate for governor, has requested
that his name be put on the ticket as
“W. Yancey Carter.” So after the
October election his name will read
in full, as follows: “Walloped Yan
cey Carter.’’—Washington, Ga., Re-
Reporter.
Candidate Yancey Carter is going
to feel mighty lonesome in 1910 when
they won’t kt him vote in the Demo
cratic primary.—Savannah Press. He

The candidate for governor of Geor
gia on the Independence League ticket
called at the secretary of state’s of
fice and asked that his name be part

if you please. Why shouldn’t he with
such extinguished men as John Tem

As the brisk philanthropist thrust

she saw that he was wet and appa

The error of a printer, who was
standing on his head or setting his
type upside down, made the Texas
Farmer, of Dallas, Texas, say that
they would send their paper on trial
25 weeks for 25 cents. The Texas
Farmer tried to say that they would
send their paper for 52 weeks, a
whole year, for 25 cents, and if you
like to send them a quarter you will
get their excellent paper for one
year.
