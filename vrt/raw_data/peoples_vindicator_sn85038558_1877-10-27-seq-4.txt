To cultivate less land ; to lmake that

so that it may plrotduce large crops;
and the practice of a rigid system of
rotation of crops and mixed farnling. T
Keepiing accounts on the farmi is
far too geielally Icgleted, and onlt
this accouint many opportunliities of
enirt;iliig OexInses Ipas by Iunl(tiC
ed; while the actual value of the
ipr1.duicts of falrminlg are generally, in
such cases, gleatly undervalued
Contentmennt on the farm is won
derfully iroiiioted \by i brief consid
eationl, now and then, of it few of its
many iadvantalilges. Agi'iculii'turail hi
hoi'ers are nlot foollish enoulgh to

Sarsaparilla, Yellow Dock, and other herbs, it forms
Dr. Tutt's Sarsaparilla
and Queen's Delight,
The most powerful blood purifier known to medical
science for the cure of old ulcers, diseased joints, foul
discharges from the ears and nostrils, abscesses, skin
diseases, dropsy, kidney complaint, evil effects of
secret practices, disordered liver and spleen. Its use
strengthens the nervous system, imparts a fair conti uO
plexion, and huilds up the'body wita
HEALTHY, SOLID FLESH.
As an antidote to syphilitic poison it is strongly
recommended. Hundreds of cases of the worst type
have been radically cured by it. Being purely veg
etable its continued use will do no harm. The best
time to take it is during the summer and fall; and
instead of debility, headache, fever and ague, you
will enjoy robust health. Sold by all druggists.
