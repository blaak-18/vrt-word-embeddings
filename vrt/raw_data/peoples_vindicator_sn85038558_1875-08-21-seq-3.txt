We are requested to state that ClI.
Win. M. Levy, member of Congress,
4th District, has received notice of a
vacancy in the Naval Academy at
Annapolis for this District, which he
is desirous of filling at once. To this
end all applicants will report in per
son in this city on or before the ist
Sept., proximo, with a view of com
petative examination ; and the candi
date selected will report at Annapo
lis, Md., for examination there on the
15th September, proximo.
The candidates must be in all res
gects physically sound, well formed
and of robust constitution, and quali
fled to endure the arduous labors of
an officer in the Navy; must be be
tween 14 and 18 years of age, of good
moral character. They most pass an
examination in reading, writing, spel
ling, arithmetic, geography and en
glish grammar. No one who is not a
citizen of this District need apply
All further particulars can be obtain
ed by addressing Col. Win. M. Levy,
at this place.
'All papers in the 4th Congression
al District will confer a favor by in
serting the above.
The crops of our parish are re
ported to be in "humetons" eon
ditions. Some good, others bad,
even worse. The late rains have,
no doubt seriously injured the
cotton, and especially such as took
the second growth, causing bolls
and forms to shed alarmingly.
The rains have been singularly
partial; that portion of the parish
where the drought was most se
vere and lasted longer, has had
nearly all the hard rains. Some
thing over 6 inches has fallen in
this city since Aug. 1st.
The Kentucky election is what
might be termed a settler, to radi
calism at least. Ohio has reason
to cheer up and we confidently
look for a "big gun" from her.
IMPORT.tN .TO MEDICAL BTUDE N-T.
The Trustees of the Louisville Medical
College (Lonisville, Ky.) have, in accord.
ance with the provisions of their charter,
established a Beneficiary System, where
by any young man studying medecine
and being unable to pay for his educa
tion, may receive a Beneficiary Scholar
ship, which relieves him of payment of
Professors' fees. The public will be
pleased to learn that this well known Col
lege has abolished all fees for its diplomas;
the Faculty being thus wholly uninterest
ed pecuniarily in the result of all examni
nations for graduation. For particulars,
address Dean of Louisville Medical Col
lege, 163 Second street, Louisville, Ky.
Olr thanks are hereby extended to
Capt. T. W. Abney, for a late Water
town, N. Y., paper ; and also his kind
remembrance of thie "Vindieator."

THE ART JOURNAL OF AMERICA,
ISSUED MONTHLY.
"A Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carriedl out.'"
The necessity of a popular medium for '
the representation of the productions of
onr great artists, has always. been recog.
nized, and many attemptns have beeln
made to metet the want. The successive
failures which so invaribly followed em,h
attempt in this country to establish an
art journal, did not prove the indiffer
ence of the 'people of America to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper
appreciation of the want and an ability
to meet it were shlown, the public at
once rallied with enthusiasm to its sup
port. and the result was ia great artistic t
and commercial triumph--THE ALDINE.
THE ALDINE, while issucd with all the
regularity,. has none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinary
peri dicals. It is an elegant miscellany
ofpure,light and graceful literature; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci- I
,hens of artistic skill, in Iblack and white.
Although each succeeding number athirds
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beauty of the AI.DINE will be
most appreciated after it his been bound
up at the close of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapness, as a
compared with r rals of a similar clas, ,
the ALDI.tx is a unique and original con
caption-alone and mnmpproached-abso- I
lutely without competition in price or
character. The possessor of a comnplete
volume cannot duplicate the quantity of
fine paper and engravings in any other
shape or number of volumes for ten times a
its cost; and them, there is the Chromo Q
besides !
National feature'oft THE ALDINE
mnst be taken in no narrow sense. True
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
I)INE is a strictly American institution,
it does not conine itself entirely to the
reprlodtion of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad and 'appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the patrons of THE
ALDINE. as a leading characteritic, the
productions of the most noted American
artista, attention will -.lways be given to (
specimens fronm foreign masters, giving I
subscribers all the pleasure and instru.c- I
tion obtainable front home or foreign t
Sources.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be afforded by any .inferior 1
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light and graceful accoment
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tnr's, with only such techuical disqrisi- i
tions as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest of the work.
Premi1um f(or 1875.
