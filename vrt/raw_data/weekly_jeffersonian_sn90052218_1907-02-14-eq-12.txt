E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
ago I received a sam
ple new magazine. I
it better than the old one that
and DeFrance stole from you.
f• f also received some sample copies of
the Weekly Jeffersonian which can't
be beat as a political weekly. I try
to get subscribers for both periodicals
but the people are slow to subscribe;
they simply don’t know a good thing
when they see It, but think I can send
a few names In a few days to be put
upon the subscription list.
Though only a boy—a poor one at
that —if I know what Populist is I
am one from the crown of my head to
the sole of my feet.
I always speak a good word for
Watson when I have a chance. Your
wprk for the last two years has been
benefit to me.
fcave never read any of your hooks,
she simple reason that I am too
■ u.o buy them. But if I live and
- Kng happens lam going to have
w Bethany if I have to split cord
Ki at 50c per cord to get It I
jgpmt it before the others because it
R<ts of the south and I am a native
■KtLherner.
Siam with you in regard to the at
of some southern leaders, to
■Btaildent Roosevelt, I don’t think they
Shim due credit when he honestly
Krves it.
®hough poor and struggling with
jroverty when I read Tom Watson’s
writings they inspire me with renew
ed hope and ambition.
Ever rest assured of my hearty ap
preciation of the good work you are
doing and that I will do all I can to
extend the irculation of your period
icals.
I remain yours very truly,
WILLIAM S. STANLEY.

Dear Sir:
Your February number Jeffersonian
Magazine came to hand yesterday. I
have read the first issue and then
loaned it out, am trying to get others
to subscribe for it and your Weekly
Jeffersonian. I get both and am due
for the Weekly which I will remit for
some time soon; don’t know how I
could get along without them for I
have always stood where you stand
and it does my heart good to know you
are still at the stand prepared to strike
above the belt. I am proud of one
thing—although we were defeated
as Populists, yet our principles are
promulgated, in a large measure, by
each of the two old parties. Mr. Bry
an seems to be anxious for the Deml
Plum but you may bet your soul he
never will reach the white house.
Why? Simply because there are
enough of the boys that did defeat
him when he went back on Mr. Wat
son to do it again. That’s the size
of It. Why I voted for McKinley and
Teddy, hence you perceive the wind
blows whence It come or goes but you
hear the sound thereof and after the
blow Is over one can see the effects
of the storm and so it has been with
the Democratic party for years, they
brag and blow and yet it don’t amount
to a hill of beans. Your last Maga
zine is simply grand. The get up is
superfine. I did not cancel my sub
scription to the New York concern, T
thought the best way to whip them
was to let them use up the money in
buying paper and printing and after
you quit I received two copies then
like Lon Livingston’s fish they swunk.
Wishing you unbounded success In
your new publications, admonishing
the people therein to nobler deeds
and higher ground, that they may
apprehend the trend of the times and
be brought to think as you think and
see as you see. Yours respectfully,
J. H. H. BROWN.

My Dear Sir:
The February number of the new
magazine has been received. It is
chock full, heaped up, pressed down,
and running over with good things
to read. I don’t blame the New York
magazine for doing the “skidoo” act.
It couldn’t play in the backyard shade
trees of the new magazine—the real
Tom kind. I had thought the January
number couldn’t be Improved upon, but
still the wonder grew, and here it is
far and away ahead of the first issue.
Real live editorials on up-to-date sub
jects as versatile in their choice as
the author’s mind. Then “Ann Boyd,”
as good as the best. Mr. Bayne’s two
contributions, “Home Life of Mr. Wat
son,” “Survey of the World,” all in
readable style. The editorial on “For
titude” can’t be beat.
My friend Mr. J. A. Kelly, of the
Senior law class and I decided we
needed the magazine in the Univer
sity Library Reading Rooms, so we
wrote a petition for the librarian to
subscribe, as Is customary, and just
asked the boys to sign as we would meet
them on the campus and at the dining
hall; we have 100 signers and could
easily get that many more.
Mr. S. B. McCall is doing good work
among the boys for the Weekly Jef
fersonian. Respectfully,
J. A. SMITH.

Dear Sir:
I have before me and have just
finished reading Watson’s Jeffersonian
Magazine. I now feel greatly relieved
because when I learned a few months
ago that your relations with Watson’s
Magazine had been severed I was ap
prehensive that you might not start
another. I congratulate you upon your
courage and enterprise and also upon
your consideration for your friends
and admirers and they are many who
will generously respond to and appre
ciate your devotion to them. lam fas
cinated by its first issue and will do
all I can to enthusiastically support
it in the future.
I note what your magazine contained
as to the money question and I agree
with it fully.
It seems to me that now would be a
good time to agitate a new issue of
greenbacks; if more money is needed
issue greenbacks. Nothing will si
lence the clamor of the National Bank
ing ring so effectually as the propo
sition to supply the business interests
of the country with the right kind of
money (greenbacks). I also note what
your magazine stated as to the candi
dates Bryan, Parker and Hearst and
think it was just right. I am sorry,
however, that you were so misled by
what the Hearst papers stated as to
Mr. Charles F. Murphy, for I think
Mr. Murphy demonstrated the only
principle of correct politics that was
discoverable on the Democratic side In
the last campaign and I feel like giv
ing him great credit considering his
surroundings. I don’t think he was
chargeable with the defeat of Mr.
Hearst and yet the culmination was
not one to Inspire confidence in the
voting public. There are a number of
men in the party who could have taken
the management of Mr. Hearst’s cam-
THE WEEKEWKPFFERSONIAN.
Blast and wltff’an expen
lalf the money have giv
•ality of at least 100,000.
naged it was one contln
f blunders from the be
ie day of election with
ults to Mr. Hearst. The
r. Hearst was a party
r hlch I feel deeply griev
ed because I fully believed that he
was sincere and really meant to do
the best good of which he was capa
ble for the common people. We have
succeeded in dislodging some of the
well entrenched state officers of the
Republican strongholds and put in
their places some at least who sup
ported our ticket in the last campaign.
I will continue to read your magazine
as long as it is published. I get it at a
newstand near my office. I find that
the demand for it far exceeds the
supply but that will no doubt be rem
edied by and by. It will supply a large
number of readers who are inclined to
be independent with reading matter
suited to their taste and in sympathy
with their own views. Sincerely yours,
J. W. SHEA.

Dear Sir:
Please send me a sample copy of
your magazine. I learned of the vent
ure in the New York Times Book
Review. In the “Life and Times of
Andrew Jackson,” I hope you will fully
discuss Jackson’s greatest “coup”
against both legal and illegal tyranny,
the smashing of the United States
bank.
Your views on political questions, de
livered in “editorials,” hitherto pub
lished in Watson’s Magazine of New
York, are the necessity of thoughtful
Americans, who seek the truth.
