NATIONAL EDUCATORS URGE
FEDERAL EDUCATION BUREAU
Resolutions in Favor of Law Observance, World Peace
and Maintenance of School Taxation, Voted by Na
tional Education- Association in Chicago Meeting.
Schools Are Investment From Whieh People Will Receive More
Good Than From Any Other Expenditure of Public Moneys, Says
New Hampshire Commissioner.
CHICAGO, March I.—Some of the nation’s foremost educators
were in Chicago the past week attending the sessions of the depart
ment of superintendence of the National Education association.
The association endorsed the feder
al department of education bill, tak
ing the stand that American schools
should be represented in the presi
dent’s cabinet. A resolution was
passed calling upon congress to make
the public schools of Washington, D.
-C. a model from which the entire
nation could copy. Arguments were
advanced by many speakers against
the reduction of school taxation. If
education is to be brought to its pro
per plane in the United States,
Ichool boards must have the requis
ite funds with which to do it.
Seek World Peace
* Other resolutions advocated world
peace and pointed to the schools of
the nation as the best possible place
in which to inculcate an understand
ing between the children of all na
tions, thus insuring the future wel
fare of humanity. Law observance,
especially of the dry laws, was also
strongly advocated by the educators.
In arguing for the congressional
bill to establish a national depart
ment of education, George D. Stray
.er of the Teachers’ College, New
York City, said: ,
“For five years those interested in
Cublic education throughout the
United States have proposed meth
ods by which the federal govern
ment may contribute to the develop
ment of a more efficient system of
public education. The bill which has
been before congress, providing a
department of education with a sec
retary in the president’s cabinet, for
research and investigation in educa
tion, and for federal aid for the pur
pose of encouraging the states to
meet certain deficiencies which are
commonly found throughout the na
tion, has been repeatedly indorsed by
this department and by state, dis
trict and local educational organiza
tion. , .
“During the past month hearings
have ben held before both the sen
ate and the house committees. Pos
sibly the most striking fact in con
nection with these hearings was the
number of laymen representing na
tional organizations who appeared in
support of the measure. Twenty
one organizations, having member
ship running into the millions, sent
their representatives to Washington
to ask that congress, through the
passage of the educaton bill, take
the next step in the development of
our public school system.
Public Sees Need
“During the period that the educa
tion bill has been before the public,
there has been developed a clear re
cognition of the need for the support
of a federal agency competent to pro
vide leadership and to undertake re
search and investigation that will be
significant for the guidance of those
charged with the responsibility of
administering education in all of the
States.
“We have long been accustomed to
the idea of research undertaken by
the federal government in the fields
of agriculture, engineering, com
merce and industry. The benefits
which have come to all of the people
from these activities are commonly
acknowledged. Many inquires should
be undertaken in education with re
pect to curricula, methods of teach
ing and of learning problems of or
ganization, administration and fin
ance, the results of which when made
available will contribute in a large
degree to the development of a more
efficient public school system.”
E. W. Butterfield, state commis
sioner of education for New Hamp
shire, declared that money placed in
schools and educational projects was
an investment from which the na
tion would reap larger and more
beneficial returns, than it would on
expenditure for another purpose.
He said in part:

“Schools are maintained by public
taxation as are also highways and
bridges, public buildings, police and
fire protection. From all the rest,
schools are by nature separate. They
never should be supported from the
same budget, administered by the
same officers or joined in the public
mind when support is sought.
“All of the money which passes
through our hands is either invested
or expended. Part we expend for food,
clothing, shelter and services. We
buy hats, houses and automobiles.
Our purchases are worth the price
but from the hour of purchase they
depreciate in value. Part we invest in
bank loans, in mortgages and in stocks
and bonds. This money is not ex
pended. It does not stand i{)le. Each
month it increases by the natural in
crease of invested funds.
“So it is with our taxes. We tax
ourselves to build roads and bridges
and public buildings. They are worth
the price, but from the day of erec
tion they continually depreciate in
value till they must be replaced or
renewed. Also we tax ourselves to
educate our children, to teach them
honesty and industry and citizen
ship. This purchase which increases
in worth each year until the pupils
in full measure can enrich the state
by their honesty and industry and
civic virtues. The money for schools,
then, we have invested. It has not
been expended.”
TWIN CITIES DOPE
RING UNCOVERED
(Continued From Page 1)
It is their story that Mrs. Hitch
cock, who is alleged to have accepted
stolen goods in lieu of money from
the drug addict who led authorities
to her home, may have obtained her
supply of narcotics from the same
source.
Evidence leading to the arrest of
the seven in Milwaukee was obtained
by a Chinese sleuth. He was em
ployed several weeks ago when fed
eral agents learned of the existence
of a drug selling ring in Milwaukee.
The narcotic supply, they were in
formed, was being smuggled in from
the Twin Cities and peddled about
the Milwaukee underworld.
Made Home In Black Kelt
The Chinese detective made his
home in the colored residence dis
trict of the city, made the acquaint
ance of Oliver Goodman, alleged ring
leader among the distributors, and
arranged the delivery of a quantity
of drugs by Sam Barker, another of
the men arrested, who, according to
the police, gave their names as Frank
Simpson, Fred Howard, Will Cureton,
Andrew Howard and George Durden.
Mrs. Hitchcock Wednesday night
was taken from the central station,
where she has been held since her ar
rest, to Ancker hospital. Physicians
Wednesday night said she was suffer
ing from a nervous collapse. Hospi
tal authorities were ordered to hold
her for further investigation by fed
eral and ‘police officials.

South Dakota Editor
Makes Futile Effort
To Pose As Comedian
From The Pierre Daily Dakotan we
take the following article, which ap
peared on the front page in a con
spicuous place. To the reader it will
be evident that the writer of the
article attempted to be funny. How
ever, the would-be Mark Twain miss
es fire.
“What next? Pierre people are
asking each other this morning. Lit
tle children are seeking refuge in
mother’s arms and hiding in sister’s
apron.
“The negroes have all left the city,
and the non-partisan sympathizers
are seeking seclusion.
“The police plainly show that they
are baffled, and go about with their
hands on their hips, and even John
Laughlin, who was never before
known to show fear, has put a white
feather in his hat band and walks
very meekly in his accustomed paths.
“School girls have cast aside that
jaunty air, and no longer trip gaily
by when going to school, but now in
groups of two and three they pass
along as though fear had taken po
session of their hearts and all thought
of books and boys driven from their
minds.
“Late last night police saw two
roughly dressed heavily hooded men
going through the city, stopping first
at this place and then at another,
tnen making signs to others and then
passed on. The police followed, and
when these mysterious strangers were
out of sight he discovered that in
every business house in the city had
I>een left the Symbol of the Hooded
Order of the K. K. K. What to do,
what should he do, was the question
uppermost in the mind of the police
man as he paced his nightly rounds.
This question he was trying to solve,
when he thought he saw in the skies
above the hills a burning cross. This
was too much, and he sought relief
in seeking advice from any belated
straggler to be found out this late at
night.
“This morning the housewives of
the city had taken up the subject
and with lowered voice were asking:
‘ls it true that the Ku Klux Klan has
come to Pierre?’ and finding no an
swer, some suggested that the Dako
tan be called. So our telephone rang
and the query came. “Are there Klan
signs all over town? Has there been
a K. K. K. organized here last night?
Was there a burning cross on the
hills of Pierre?” The reporter, of
couse, could not at first tell the
truth, but owing to our unchange
able policy to tell the truth, we had
to tell them that these K. K. K.
cards over the city were nothing
more or less than a bit of advertis
ing propoganda put out by the Kiwa
nians announcing the minstrel show
by the Klandestine Kiwanis Klub,
which is soon to be staged in Pierre.
As to the burning cross deponent say
eth not.”
CONGRESSMAN TO
PROBE SHOOTING
not at all satisfied with the report at
prohibition headquarters that the
agents shot Lahr in self-defense.
“I am going to demand an investi
gation of the affair by a government
agency, which is not in any way con
nected with the prohibition unit. It
is a waste of time for prohibition
orficials to investigate the shooting.
We don’t want a white-wash; we want
facts. What is necessary is a sweep
ing inquiry by investigators, who can
work independently of Commissioner
Haynes and State Director Qvale and
without prejudice.
“I understand that Commissioner
Haynes has given his approval to the
action of the dry agents. I have not
given my approval. Before I reach
my conclusion, I want to know what
an impartial investigation discloses.
“'I am going to St. Cloud next week
and while there, I will go into the
matter more fully. In the meantime.
I have written authorities and others
there, asking for affidavits and com
pile details and particulars.”
If the alleged statements of Con
gressman Knutson were not intended
for home consumption, it is hard to
guess why they were sent forth. If
Knufson wants to be re-elected it
will be absolutely necessary for him
to show much interest in the investi
gation of the Lahr shooting, also it
is politically tactful for him to leave
some sort of an impression that he
is not a believer in present prohibi
tion legislation. It would never do
for Congressman Harold Knutson to
come out openly as a prohibitionist
and at the same time wish re-elec
tion.
Senators Johnson and Shipstead de
clared that they would not take any
action in the matter until they had
an opportunity to thoroughly exam
ine the reports of the investigation.
They agree with Mr. Knutson that a
thorough investigation of the affair
should be made by some government
agency not connected with the pro
hibition office.
Washinjrton, lowa, Klan
Hears State Speaker
WASHINGTON, IA„ March 1.- A
well known educator and lecturer for
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ad
dressed the local organization here
the other evening, outlining the prin
ciples and aims of the order.
The meeting was an invitational
one, end the majority of the audi
ence wore non-members. Following
the address, the invitation was ex
tended to ell the native born white
gentile Protestants to affiliate, if
they so desired. Most of them took
advantage of the invitation.
There is no doubt about the popu
larity of the Klan in Washington and
the surrounding county. Member
ship is increasing rapidly, ami some
effective work is being done In the
matter of cleaning-up.

KANSAS CHURCH GETS
LARGE KLAN DONATION

STERLING KAN., March 3.—En
thused by a gift of S6OO from the Ku
Klux Klan toward the church build
ing fund of the Baptist church, resi
dents of Sterling are crediting the
Klan with turning the attitude to
ward completing a new edifice from
despair to hope. The gift was one
of the largest ever contributed to a
Kansas church by the order. Weary
from the depressing struggle to fi
nance the construction of a modern
church home, which was in the pro
cess of construction, members were
afraid the project would fail or be
indefinitely delayed. They appealed
to the local Klan and the gut was
raised in a short time.
REASONS WHY UNITED STATES NEEDS FEDERAL
EDUCATIONAL BUREAU GIVEN BY COMMISSIONER
(Scottish Rite News Bureau)
WASHINGTON, D. C„ March 4.
Dr. Payson Smith, state commission
er of education in Massachusetts,
puts forth facts in support of the
need of this nation for a department
of education in words which inter
twine public school education, civic
consciousness and Americanism so
closely that are seen as one and un
divisible. He says:
“One-fifth of our entire population
are engaged in the business of going
to school and getting an education.
This is a business of highest import
ance to the nation. It should be so
managed that it develops in citizen
ship the quality of intelligence,
teaches the meaning and significance
of American institutions and pre
pares for economics and industrial
responsibility.
“More and more the people as a
whole are being called on to exercise
directly the functions of government.
Not only are they chorfting their of
ficers in primary and general elec
tions, but increasingly they are set
tling questions of policy at general
elections. In such a situation, we
niust have an education that will pro
duce an electorate interested in civic
problems and willing and able to use
thought, care, and discrimination in
th settlement of them.
“Our American schools must be so
taught that we shall decrease the 1
proportion of people who can he mis
led easily by the spacious reason ini;
of the agitator ami the demagogue.
We must see our problems not in the
light of selfish (tersonal interest,
but with reference to the righteous
ness of the issues ami the principles [
Fifteen-Year-Old Chicago Boy Who
Is Armless, Overcomes All Handicaps
HENRY WIEGMAN DEMONSTRATING HOW HE OVERCAME HANDICAP
Being crippled and without arms is not too great a handicap for Henry
Wiegman, fifteen, of Chicago. This unfortunate boy is making a winning
fight against his tremendous afflictions. Henry is a pal of “Uncle Robert,”
friend of afflicted boys and girls. Henry showed he could do many things
the other boys of his age do with both arms and legs. He wrote a letter
on a typewriter with the aid of a stick clutched between his shoulder and
his cheek. He drew a picture of Uncle Sam with the aid of a pencil held
in his mouth. He carried a chair on his shoulder, removed his hat and coat
and put them on again—all this without the use of arms. Henry is par
ticularly keen about art work and hopes to become an accomplished com
mercial artist.

involved. An ability to distinguish
that which is untrue from that which
is false an ability to face facts and
a courage in facing them, are among
the things toward which American
education must strive.”
To this ringing statement, John W.
Abercrombie, state superintendent of
education in Alabama, adds facts
which show how badly this nation
needs a concrete, supervised, nation
al program of education. He says:
“There are in the United States
5,000,000 persons 10 years of age and
over who cannot read and write in
any language; about 3,500,000 others
who cannot speak, read or write the
English language; several, million
more who can barely read and write,
and are, therefore, practically illit
erate. The presence of so large a
number of illiterates and near-illiter
ates is a menace to American ideals
and institutions.
“Education is both a state and a
national problem, because in this age
of transportation, trade, travel, com
munication, visitation and migration,
whatever jeopardizes the freest and
fullest development of any state or
section imperils such development in
every other state and section of our
common country. It is no longer
possible to permit a child to grow
into citizen.snip in ignorance any
where without endangering every
other citizen bverywhere. Hence, it
is the bounden duty of both the
states and the. federal government,
separately and cooperatively, to see
to it that every person, regardless of
age. ia adequately trained for ef
ficient citizenship and for succeas in
the occupations of life.”
Oklahoma Is Proud of
New Grand Dragon
SHAWNEE. OKLA., March I.
Klansmen, salute the new “Grand
Dragon” of Shawnee, Oklahoma.
Clay Jewett Box was born Feb
ruary 27. 1924, in this city. At
the regular meeting of Shawnee
Xian last night announcement w’as
made that a son was born to Mr.
and Mrs. Box of this city, and the
proud parents sent word to the
local Klan to name the first boy
born in Shawnee in 1924. Klans
men of this jurisdiction were
highly elated over the honor of
naming the new babe, and on mo
tion of the Kligrapp it was unani
mously agreed that the name of
our Grand Dragon of Oklahoma,
Newton Clay Jewett, be given the
bouncing youngster. Mr. Box is
not a Klansman, but he and his
good wife are in thorough sym
pathy with the principles of the
order.

learning is exhibited in the disre
gard of the expert. The late James
Bryce once said that Americans are
disposed to over-exalt the ability of
the common man and to undervalue
training for particular forms of serv
ice.”
He attacked the Society for the
Preservation of American History, an
organization which is trying to re
establish the old anti-British vogue
of writing and teaching American
history. This organization, he said,
charges that those who have been
writing impartial and accurate his
tories have been unduly influenced.
Can Democracy Survive?
“Can a democracy rise and grow
stronger if it rejects the truth?” he
asked. “Can democracy survive if it
revolts against knowledge; can its
representatives meet the test of cili
zensip if the social sciences are to
be vised and censored by those who
are not students of their facts; can
truth and justice prevail when knowl
edge is pushed into the background?
Shall local legends be glorified and
historical characters be surrounded
with a halo, or shall there be a criti
cal analysis of facts and a faithful
consideration of the actual struggles
of men? Who loves his country
more, the one who loves the truth
and insists upon the truth being dis
covered and taught, or the one who
denies the truth and, refusing that
it shall be taught, or the one who
denies the truth and, refusing that
it shall be taught, makes his appeal
to prejudice and passion.”

“THE STORE THAT HAPPY FEET BUILT’
NEWSBOY FOR FIERY
CROSS IS ATTACKED
Editor Puts “Crimp" in One
Would-be Bout of Fisticuffs
in St. Paul
A newsboy for the Minnesota Fiery
Cross recently established himself on
the corner of Seventh and Wabasha,
where he told the world that the Ku
Klux Klan paper was available.
For several hours he was the cen
ter of verbal abuse, but this only en
couraged the Fiery Cross salesman
to do his utmost.
The quiet indifference of the boy
selling the Ku Klux Klan weekly
finally became too much for a group
of men who couldn’t stand to see the
passing pedestrians buying “the dirty
sheet," so they went over to a group
of boys and urged then, to “pull
some rough stuff.”
The editor of the Minnesota Fiery
Cross happened to be standing near
and put the crimpers on the planned
attack. He endeavored to get the
identity of the “fearless defenders
of the faith” who tried to instigate
an assault, and secured information
that may prove interesting one of
these days..
Later the same day a “cop” came
along and made some slurring re
marks about the Ku Klux Klan and
otherwise let it be known that he
“hates the* nightsheeters.”
The Fiery Cross newsboy insists
that the “cop” encouraged several
boys in their mudslinging attacks.
The Minnesota Fiery Cross is check
ing up on the policemen’s “beats” so
as to get the name of the “copper.”
The Minnesota Fiery Cross has a
lawful right to place newsboys on
street corners and demands police
protection for them. And such police
protection will be given, or the rea
son for the failure* to provide the
same definitely known.
