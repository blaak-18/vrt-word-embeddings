Stvy by iieglin i ohe vote iat its
primaries, and thus pledh e them
.olv' 's to vote for Foster when
nominhatll e at Slh revirio. TheIl
l )emnocratic party cannot win the
a State tight without us, lndl are
hoping to win i1us ack antd then
Sit ray us. Thi mnorning, the
_ rimes )emocrat of this city, con
titins the foliowing teleralun, &riv
ins the action of the Democratic
houllse :
"The Polists are invited to
participate in the lemocrotie white
primaries of Morehouse parish, if
they will support the regular Deni
ocratic nominee (Foster), in the
g eneral election next Apri:."
In Onachita parish, a telegram
from Monroe to the Daily Pica
ure of this city, publ)ished this
morning, shows that the DI)emo
cratic parish committee adopted
yesterday the following resolu
tion :
"All white voters who have
heretofore withdrawn from the
Democratic party, who desire to
return to the same and who will
pledge themselves to support the
nominees of the Democratic State i
convention, (Foster for. Governor),
Sshall be permitted to vote.
And elsewhere the same tactics -
are pursued.
This circular letter is written to
warn you in time of the treachery
which awaits us if we accept these
invitations.
If Foster is the Democratic
nominee, (and this seem assured)
every principle of our party will
find in him a hitter antagonist.
To this date not a word has es- t
I caped his lips as to the silver ques
tion. Besides he is a foe of an
honest election in Louisiana. It
was Democratic Commissioners
Democratic Returning Boards- r
Democratic election methods-that I
votes honestly cast for them last
November for Congress. If Pop
ulist voters go to the Democratic
primaries, they will be bound by r
the result. It is required that you I
should first pledge yourself to vote c
for the Democratic nominees, then
you can vote at Democratic pri
maries. If you vote for Dl)emo
ceratic members of the Legislature, I
the Diemocraitic caucus will settle
the question of the United States
Senatorship.l
Every Democrat will be bound e
by the iron rules of the caucus to
vote for Foster's candidate for c
the United States Senate. ii
Foster wants a gold-bug sent to
Washington. If he does not, why
can he not come out squarely for a
free coinage of both gold and sil fi
ver at the ratio of 16 to I tl
This circular is sent out to warn d
you in time. Let Democratic pri
maries alone !
When our Convention meets,
we will put ia State ticket in the
field which will command the sup
port of the business community,
of all those who donot make poli
ties a prodfesion, and we will ask
id recee the support of every
friemd of honest elections in Lou
ikilas. A. B. BOOTH,
Chairman.
if you mention to your merehant h
that you patronize him because he r
advertise. in this paper. . sI
No Populist will vote to select a,
Dumocratic canm4dates.

If you are a Populist don't vote
in any IDemocratic primary, no
matter what you are told. Keepyu
strictly away from toem. hp in !
tieSoto the )emoctacy did not
consider you the equal of the ne
gro-they included the latter in
their ranks, but excluded you
from participating in their elec
tion. Should any thing cause you
to keep out of their electrons that
fact would. Not only does this
warning apply to State politics.
Parochial primaries are also in-d
cluded.
Now if you are a i opuhst, you
will show your respect for your
party by refusing to have any-'t
thing to do with the Democratic
primary elections.
