PRIMA-DONNA
S1he small town of Silver Creek was
e In a state of intense excitement over
° the news that a rare and wonderful
singer, "in fact, one of the divinest
voices ever heard upon the stage," as
a New York daily had said, was go
ing to visit them for one night on her
way to San Francisco.
You should have seen the stampede
to the music store for reserved seat
6 tickets-for any tickets-for permission
s to stand inside the hall. In one day
every inch of room in the shabby build
ing was bought up and that a week
before the time. All Silver Creek was
either steeped in triumphant satisfac
tion or plunged in covetous longings.
The day arrived. So did the prima
donna and her attendants.
The crowd of sight-seers who were
waiting at the railwoy station saw
nothing for their pains, except three
gentlemanly lookng foreigners who led
an impenetrably vailed lady into a cab.
Mademoiselle Cephise de Fascatl was
driven to the best hotel in the town.
No sooner were the doors of the
"Music Hall" opened than a dense
multitude took their seats, and there
after ensued for one full hour such
crammings of ruffles and squeezing
past knees, and pushing of elbows,
as had never been seen in that hall
btfore.
And at last the three gentlemen en
tered, and arranged themselves as the
orchestra; the subdued scrapings of
violins, and roulading of silver flutes,
held the garcon part of the audience
spell-bound in breathless anticipation,
and everybody prepared to be aston
lshed.
So they were.
The prims donna glided in from a
side door, her long amber satin robe
trailing over the carpeted platform,
her white satin petticoat adorned with
lie and embroidery, her gold hair
flowing in ringlets, and sprinkled loose
ly with white camellias, her snowy
throat enriched by gold, her dainty
white feet decked with gilt butterflies,
her small, upright figure so lissome. so
graceful, rising out of a gold-and-wtite
Moorish scarf, which was knotted
, loosely at one side.
A vision of perfect grace and Paris
ian taste was she; but the face which
confrented the audience was the
ugliest in the room.
A short 4f shock ran through the
hearts of the throng. They had ex
s pected beauty to match the famous
I- voice. Why not? The papers had
called her young, attractive, the idol I
of every city.
Here was a veritable Gorgon.
There was a palpable silence as she
N swept to the front of the platform,
b where a bank of flowers did duty in
stead of foot-lights. The applause
it which had risen up like a whirlwind
ý at the first glimpse of the gold-ond
a bite figure, was now hushed and
dumb-smitten.
Mademoiselle Cephise turned with
unmoved face to her orchestra, and
straightway a low sobbing broke from
violin and silver flute, like the softest
f. whispers ato the Aeolian harp, and the
voice rose up, not glad and joyous as
the tones of those who have found
a life a holiday, but sadly, proudly, pure
ly, in its lonely beauty, like the voice
eft an angel who, wandering through
5 sordid sceaes in search of the All
t Good, sings a song not of earth, but
one taught by Heaven's ministers.
Oh, voice of majesty, of piercing,
thrilling, pulsing, peerless sweetness!
u How it tranced each vulgar soul in the
Sed hall that night, and dragged them
from their sordld selves to peep with
" awe-struck eyes through the golden
bars to heaven! How it taught cold
hearts their first lesson of love, td
charity, of adoration to Him who rules
above all! How it wafited the angel
faces of the dead to weeping friends,
and sent the innocent baby cheek back
e to nestle on the mother's yearning
' bosomni
SBeloved voice, guerdon surely of a
Snoble soul!
SThe song- or one should say the
divine pamlm-was ended, when a
Screak at one of the doors broke the
riateate stillness which astonishment
and emotion had bounded the audience
with, and an old woman, dripping from
I-the cold rain without, edged herself
Into the crowded building. She was
agmedn bowed together with rheu
m am; a few sparse white locks fell
Sfrom her old black bonnet over her
Spoor, thina cheeks; her faded shawl
scarcely bid her bony arms from tim
-glse of te throng, and her skirt was
ot ottaon, worn to rag, but mended
somehow to hang together. She had
a buket on her arm olled with
mtebhes, spools of cotton, tape, and
needles; but the matehes were spoliled
by the rain, and her whole stock
"Comes come, Mother Peileter," aid

woman, looking eagerly about with
her keen, black eyes, "I heard a voice

Dewn stepped a lady from a re

"She shall stay, Mr. Harold," said

ladles, Ilke flowers In a wehr-feotck
garden-bed with their fluttering fans
all in motion, and their faces looking Ir
very white and patrician in the strong h,
light; and then she saw the burning ti
pile of conservatory flowers on the
platform, and one figure standing up h1
in gold and white which glimmered. 1
thought the old Parislenne in her la
heart, "like the blessed sunlight and p
the holy moonlight caught and bound w
in one sheaf;" and then-the voice. tl
Mother Pelletler was tottering up n,
the crowded aisle, pushing between s1
the people, wedging herself past every
thing, slowly but resolutely up to the el
platform, until, at the last verse of the tl
song, she was directly in front, her W
withered hands holding onto the edge ti
of the stage, her stock in trade lying ti
forgotten at her feet, wh4ile flue lIa!sv h,
and r -istached gents looked on in dis- ti
may. to
Madeamoiselle Cephise, pausing after ci
a brilliant roulade for the instrument
to echo it, saw, for the first time, the t1
wrinkled face at her feet. tu
Suddenly her white-gloved hands pi
came together, and that form of grace as
became strangely rigid. The echo ol
died away, the players looked in sur- In
prise at their prima-donna. Had she e(
forgoten? Had her voice failed her? tl
They repeated the echo once. twice.
No answer from the bird-like voice.'
They faintly sketched the next few at
bars In the desperate hope of re'alling 1q
mademoiselle to herself, and the lead- '1
er hold toward her the sheets of mlsice, w
What? Mute still?
The orchestra rose In alarm, every
soul in the house did the same, as if
moved by one common panic. a
And at this moment the prima-donna 1
began to walk across the platform, andt d
to come down the steps into the hall,
with tier long, golden train floating T
behind her, and every satin fold be- tu
traying the tremulous motion of the pi
limbs, while she held her white arms,
all laden with clanking bracelets, out
stretched toward old Mother Pelletier.
"Mother! mother!" sobbed the prima
donna, falling on her knees, and clasp
ing the faded, dripping relic of human
ity to the silken breast. "Ah! do you ii
not remember your Petite?" r
"This is my daughter's voice, but sot
Petite's lovely face," returned the old
woman, trembling.
Then Mademoiselle Cephise tore off
a cunning mask, and disclosed the le
sweetest girl-face ever mother gloated
over to the bewildered gaze of the
audience.
And there was stupefied silence,
while the pair clung together in an
embrace which seemed as if it would
have no end.
At last the leader of the orchestra
went down and spoke to the prima
donna, and presently, with that lovely
young face still exposed. she swept
back to the platform on his arm, and
said. In clear, though faltering tones:
"My friends, I cannot sing again to
you to-night. A great joy has come to
me. I left my mother five years ago
in Paris, because she would have me
wed one who was worthless, though
wealthy; and came to this generous
land' to earn my breed thus. Pardon o
me, if, to be kept pure and stainless, I
wore this mask. I shall wear it no
longer. My mother will protect me.
After I left her, she fell into poverty,
and followed me to America, hoping
to find me. Ah, thank Heaven, that d
is over! Now, dear friends, I will stay
one day longer, and sing to-morrow
evening for you-without the mask."
And then they all applauded until
the hall rocked to its foundation.
Bad Bill's Theolegy. .
Great Bend, Kan., now one of the v
i best towns in the state, was at one 14
time about the worst. This was when I
t it was a railroad terminus, before s
Dodge City was established. A trav
eling evangelist went to Great Bend
and tried to start a revival. There a
were a few Christians in town, and
these all attended the first meeting,
u the only one of the unregenerate pres
i ent being "Bad Bill," who took a front t
I seat. Every one feared trouble when t
i he walked into the church, but he sat
Squietly during the exortation. The
evangelist requested all who wanted
to go to heaven to stand up, and every
person present except Bill arose. When
they were seated again Bill got up and I
drawing two pistols, said: "You all
say you want to go to heaven. Now, I
anything I can do to help this game
along and give pleasure to the players
I'm in for. You all want to go to
heaven, and I'll give you as good a
chance as you'll ever have. The firpt
man that gets up I'll give him a ticket
clean through, without any stop-ever."
The evangelist crawled under the seat
and the members of the congregation
lay on the chairs. "Well," said Bill,
"I see you wasn't in earnest, so we
will put out the lights and call this
' meetin' adjourned." One by one he
Sshot out the lights, and by morning I
