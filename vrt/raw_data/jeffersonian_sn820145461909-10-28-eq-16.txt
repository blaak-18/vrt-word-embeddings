I high, 7 inches wide and 2 inches thick. The binding is the very finest quality of genuine English Buckram, exactly

is solid gold, not gilt, biu gold, which never tarnishes or grows dim and faded. The 5,000 pages of solid reading ? ? -.y
matter is printed on the finest grade of heavy book paper, Irom large, clear, new type. The Library of Universal
History is the one trust worthy—the one reliable history unequivocally endorsed by the leading schools and colleges.
It is the very highest—the final authority—the history which is in 250,000 homes.
The Library of Universal History stands in a class alone. There has never been another like it. There never
will be such another. Most histories are simply a collection of names, dates, and dry and uninteresting facts. The
Universal is the Life-Story of the Human Race, from the earliest dawn of history right down to the present day,
told in such vivid, compelling fashion that your attention is riveted and held more strongly than by the most powerful | ?
g novel. The descriptive powers displayed are wonderful. As you read the thrilling narrative, it is as though you
were watching the most stupendous events of the great World-Story, unrolled by magic hands on a screen before
your very eyes. You see our earliest ancestors, more brute than human, struggling for their very existence among
the strange, terrible dangers of the young world. Watch the branchingout of the different races, their development ■
B of civilizations and government. You live with the pyramid-builders of far-off, mystic Egypt. Cross the Rubicon
with Caesar’s mighty, never-conquered cohorts, and fight again with them the battles that have changed the
destiny of nations. All “the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome, ” are spread before you. You
see Napoleon as he takes his final parting from his beautiful and beloved queen, Josephine; you hear him as he
answers her frenzied pleading with the deathless words: »‘'My destiny and France demand it.” Follow him to
B Water'u J and stand beside him on that awful day as his proud army and all his hopes are crushed and beaten by the 1
Iron Duke, Wellington. Ail the nations, all the peoples of the ancient and modern world pass before you in
one great, gorgeous pageant. You can know the great men and the warriors of all the ages, the colossal world
figures of all times as you know the rulers and statesmen cf the present day. Mail the coupon now —today.
