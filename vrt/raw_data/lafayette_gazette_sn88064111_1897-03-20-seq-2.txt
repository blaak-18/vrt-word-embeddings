d WHITE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.
Thd sugar Republicans will have
to admit Mr. Nigger within their
Sranks if they want to get some of
the spoils. A white Republican
prty might be a success in Louis
ana, but the moment the negro is
made part of the organization, it
will go to pieces. Mr. E. N. Cor
nay, a member of the Howell exe
cutive committee, has already re
signed. He is opposed to the ne
go being admitted with the LillyI
Whites.--St. Martinville Messenger.
The Gazette has always con
tended that it was impossible to
maintain a strictly wlite Republi
can party in Louisiana. While it
is undeniably true that many white 1
men would gladly welcome such a
party the experience of the past dec
ade in several Southern States
proves conclusively that the negro
will inevitably press his way into
any organization which bears the
name of Republican. It is just as
impossible to exclude Sambo from
participation in Republican circles
as it is for the young buzzard to re
tain the snowy-whiteness of its first
feathers. The Lilly White Repub
lican party and the dusky hawk
may, for a short time, wear nothing
but white garments, but in due
course of time the natural color be
comes painfully visible.
The Gazette would like to see a
white Republican party in Louis
iana, but to wish for such a thing
would be committing an act of un
pardonable skepticism. The Re
publican party was founded upon
the principle of social and political
equality of the two races, and no
man can hope to rise within its
ranks tinless he believes, or affects
to believe, that the colored brother
should be accorded all the rights
and privileges that the white man
enjoys. That the Lilly Whites have
come down another peg and have
expressed their willingness to co
operate with the negro wing of the
Republicans is no surprise to those
who are acquainted with the history
of the g. o. p. since the war.
When the Lilly Whites endorsed
the negro Blandin as a presidential
elector those Republicans who were
sincerely in favor of a white party
realized that their last hope was
irretrievably lost.
Hon. John Dymond, one of the
brainiest men in the country and
one of the staunchest Democrats in
Louisiana, has resigned as president I
of the Sugar Planters' Association.
Speaking of his resignation the
Baton Rouge Advocate says:
Hon. John Dymond tendered his
resignation as president of the Su
gar Planters' Association at the late
meeting of that organization and 1
recommended the selection of some
one who was in full political sym
pathy with the bulk of the members
of that organization. Nearly all
the members of the association
have strayed away from the ancient
faith and have bowed down to the
false gods of a Republican protec
tive tariff, and no doubt Mr. Dy
mond feels somewhat out of place
in the presidential chair of such an
organization, where nearly all the
membership is out of touch with
him. While we consider it the
proper thing for Mr. Dymond to do
under the circumstances, yet it is
difficult to see how the association
which, according to its character is
non-partisan, can accept his resig
nation without giving the incident a
political coloring. If the Sugar
Planters' Association should thus
confess itself a sort of adjunct to
the McKinley propaganda then its
deiciency as an organization must
be suerionsiy impaired.

Rebellion is -s. a natural right
granted to the oppressed :people of
all countries, be the forms of gov
ernment wvhat they may; it is as
sacred and incontestable as the right
of self-defense and 'preservation
which God gave to man.
The Cuban people have been and
are cruelly oppressed by the govern
ment of Spain. For years they
have struggled under the oppressive
yoke of heartless tyrants. They
have suffered far more than the
people of the thirteen English
colonies under the rule of King
George.- If the right to rebel
against oppression did not exist,
there never would have been a Re
public in the world. Our great
and proud American republic would
not shine as the glory of the new
world and wonder of mankind.
During a period of over two years
the Cuban patriots have, without
assistance, maintained themselves
against a great European power.
They have certainly shown enough
patriotism and sufficient strength to
entitle them to be recognized as.
belligerents by the United States,
and be treated in accordance with
the usages of warfare by all civilized
nations. To deny them that right
is to encourage General Weyler in
his infamous and barbarous treat
ment of prisoners of war. To longer
withhold that right from the Cubans
is to sanction the crimes committed
by . this inhuman butcher in his
cowardly persecution of women and
children. The government of the
United States can not long refrain
from recognizing the Cubans as
belligerents, without incurring the
reproach of all liberty-loving
Americans, and without laying
itself liable to the charge of disown
ing the traditions of the revolution
and of becoming an accomplice to
the revolting policy of Spain.
Inadvertently we have failed to
mention the change of the Lafayette
Gazette from a patent sheet to an
all home 6-column folio. Always
bright and breezy The Gazette gains
in vigor with the growing years and
we trust its energy and enterprise in
furnishing the people of Lafayette
with an excellent paper will meet
ample recompense. - Abbeville
Meridional.
The Messenger makes a strenuous
kick because some Breaux Bridge
people visited New Iberia on Mardi
Gras instead of St. Martinville.
To this objection the Valley replies
that the Breaux Bridge people
should be accorded the privilege of
consulting their wishes in the mat
ter. The Gazette desires to inform
its esteemed contemporaries that in
the future Lafayette will offer an
amicable settlement of this vexed
question by celebrating Mardi Gras
in such a splendid manner that the
people of Breaux Bridge will only
be displaying their proverbial good
sense by coming here to witness a
parade that will far surpass any
thing ever seen in this part of the
State.
John L. Sullivan has been chosen
by the New York World~to report
the Corbett - Fitzsimmops fight,
while the Journal has secuied the
distingui4.~:d services of ex-Senator
John J. Ingalls for a like duty.
The Washington Post is put to it to
decide as to their respective merits,
and says in discussing the subject:
"We confess that the task of de
ciding between Hon. John J. Ingalls
and Hon. John L. Sullivan as his
torians of the forthcoming prize
fight quite appalls us. Of course,
under ordinary literary circum
stances there would be no occasion
for a moment's doubt. Mr. Sulli
van's style is vigorous enough, to
be sure, but it is somewhat crude.
In fact, it belongs rather to the
stone age than to the fin de siecle
empyrean. He knows not the
iridescent dream. He reminds one
of thehairy monsters that overran
the Roman Empire under Attila and
Alaric. His vocabulary is simple
and contracted. But may it not be
that this scarred warrior will be
able to chant the rude music of the
bif and bang, the left hook and the
punch, with something like inspira
tion, after all? Is it not possible
that in this particular domain of
chronicle he may prove no mean
rival of the mellifluous and polished
bard who now attunes his lyre to an
unfamiliar them.S" -
