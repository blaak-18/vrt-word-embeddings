baby,” as she finished brushing out
the little girl’s damp locks.
It was the work of but a few min
utes to pack her trunk and acquaint
Mrs. Brown with the urgency of the
call which anticipated her leaving
only a few days, and Melissa set out
with her sister for the station. Ar
riving there she was dismayed at
learning that the only train that was
yet to go up did not stop at the small
stations. S'he would have to wait till
a late hour the next morning for the
regular passenger train.
“Pa’ll be dead by then,” wept
Anna Maria, “les’ walk, M’lis.” But
Melissa thought hard for a brief
space. It was out of the question to
walk the twelve miles that stretched
■ahead of them, the vehicle that
brought them from “Roselawn” was
already out of sight on its return, but
by humbling her pride she might en
list the aid of Tommy Young in get
ting for her a private conveyance; she
knew there was no livery stable in the
place. That short gentleman of fury
coloring listened with sympathy to
her tale of distress and regretted
much that he did not know of a team
that could be procured for love or
money. “Unless you’re a mind to
take my turnout; it’s not so stylish,
but all right ’nough fer me to drive
through, the country buyin’ uip
chick’ns, aigs ’en sich like to keep
my shop runnin’, ’n’ I’ll be proud to
lend it to you,” and he rubbed his
freckled hands briskly and looked at
her inquiringly.
It was a huge slice of humble pie,
but the exigencies of the case ad
mitted of no refusal. She accepted
with thanks, protesting rather weakly
against taking him out in the in
clement weather.
“Shoo, that’s nothin’, I’m neither
sugar nor salt ’n ’ never ask the
weather no odds, even if the wind
blows,” with cheerful alacrity, as he
assisted the girls into the wagon un
der the huge umbrella and carefully
tucked in the blanket and oilcloth,
not forgetting to hand to the younger
sister a paper bag of taffy, to offset
in away the discomfort of the long
drive through the drizzling rain and
the darkness.
Henry Reed was low with a typical
case of typhoid fever, contracted
while off working’ at the carpenter
trade. Mrs. Reed, with copious tears,
retold the short, sad story, uncon
scious of the tragic revelation the
details held for her daughter.
“I’ve done all I could for him
from the very first; fried chick’n as
long as he’d eat it ’n’ cooked ev’ry
thing ’at he liked, ’n’"missed him
day ’n’ night.”
Melissa looked at her mother with
a sort of horrified amazement. It was
incredible that she knew so little
about the care of a case of this treach
erous disease.
“Ma, you ought to have sent for
the doctor.”
“He wouldn’t hear to the doctor
cornin’ ’n’ I though myself ’at if
Wilson’s Swamp Fever Sure Cure
didn’t fetch -him round ’t wa’n’t no
use to try doctor’s stuff, to say noth
in’ ’bout it, costin’ sich er sight.”
Melissa closed her lips tightly to
keep back words that would later add
to her mother’s grief. She knew that
her lather’s case was desperate and
that it was little use to have Dr.
Glje Jeffersonian
Ray save for ‘the sustaining comfort
of his presence and approval of her
management. Three days later Henry
Reed passed from the scene of many
hardships and little Caroline returned
from the funeral with a chill, the be
ginning of the same fever that had
robbed her of 'her father. Then Me
lissa put to practical use her hospital
training, and in her efforts to lessen
the danger of infection, a general and
thorough change from the slipshod
•system that had prevailed during hur
father’s illness was necessarily insti
tuted. The isolation ami strict diet
ing of t'he patient calling forth many
resentful comments from the mother
and neighbors, though the new order
was enforced as gently as the cir
cumstances admitted. In the course
of the following weeks three more of
the children a,nd 'the mother were
prostrated with the insidious disease.
With only Anna Maria as a regular
assistant, and lacking many conveni
ences tht would have made lighter the
arduous task of nursing five patients,
Melissa found her hands and heart
burdened to the limit of her endur
ance. A weary siege of four long
weeks and little Caroline was laid be
side her father. The other sufferers
were convalescing.
“M’lis is er pow’ful hand to nuss.
She’s so perticler ’at she even keeps
our dishes in here ’n’ don’t ’low ’em
washed in the kitchen with ’other
dishes. We ain’t had no vittles but
jes’ some’n’ to drink ’n’ it strained.
The milk is het up to par’lize the
live pis’n ’at in it, but you see in
spite of all ’at extry nussin’ my
Car’line’s gone, ’n’ M’lis was with
her from the fust. Es ’at child had
lived I’d always though ’at lettin ’ the
children eat what was left on their
pa’s plate when he was so bad off
was er tumble mistake, ’at they had
ketched the fever through plumb
keerlessness, but now I know it was
the Lord’s will ’at we should be took
down ’n’ ’at nothin’ ain’t goin’ to
save er body when the call comes, or
M’lis’d er saved Ca’line. I’m sure
of that. I only wisht I knowed half
as well how I’m goin’ to get erlong
w'thout my old man. Es M’lis’d only
nuss some’rs close, so ’at she could
come home ’tween times, I wouldn’t
feel so broke up. I need her more’n
I do her money, she’s my right hand
an’ knows what’s what, but she’s got
em high flyin’ notions ’bout goin’ off
God knows where, to git writ erbout
in newspapers ’n ’ have er great name
like Florence Barton, Clara Night—
Night—what you caller, ’n’ all em old
maids ’at I ain’t agin, fer mebbe
they never had no home folks, but
its diff’n’t with our M’lis; she’s our
mainstay. No, Mis’ Edson,-I ain’t
no nuss, but I’m tumble upset fer I
don’t see how I’m to keep the chil
lern together.”
Melissa, sitting by the window in
the next room, watched a sturdy fig
ure on horseback jog down the road
and disappear in the autumn woods.
It was Tommy Young. Tommy had
been the friend in need in her time
of sorrow, and now he had come to
say that he needed a boy in the cor
ner shop and wished to engage 'Billy,
as soon as he could be out.
With only the thin partition be
tween them, Melissa had listened to
her mother’s words with varying emo
tions. She also had pondered on the
harrassing problem, arriving at no
decision. But on hearing her mother’s
