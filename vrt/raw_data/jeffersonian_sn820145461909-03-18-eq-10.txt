National 'Banks, Once More
By special request of Jos. M. Ste
phens, Secretary of the National Mon
etary League, the following letter and
Mr. Watson’s reply are reprinted
from the Educational Department of
the Jeffersonian Magazine for March:
Pembroke, Ga.
Being very ignorant of national af
fairs, at a glance the relations of Na
tional banks to both the government
and individuals, until the whole truth
came home to me in the following in
stance: 1 was elected cashier of our
local national bank, and was directed
to buy a small batch of two per cent
United States bonds, for which we
paid a slight premium. The amount
of these bonds (face value) was issued
in currency as a circulating medium,
leaving the net investment on the part
of the bank represented by premium
paid on bonds. On this little invest
ment a dividend of several hundred
per cent was paid annually in the
shape of interest on these bonds. As
the bank is a private corporation, I
could see where individuals can make
millions of dollars incorporating na
tional banks.
Kindly answer us through some is
sue of your magazine as to about what
percentage or how many dollars goes
directly from the treasury into the
pockets of stockholders in national
banks through this channel. What
amount of interest does Uncle Sain
pay to New York banks in this way?
Yours truly,
M. E. C.
(Answer.)
Inasmuch as our great and good
Government hands out to the Nation
al banker a dollar in paper money for
every dollar invested in the bond, it
should be apparent to everyone that
whatever advantage there is in owning
the bond is a governmental bonus.
For example: Smith and Jones and
Brown and Tompkins agree to join
hands and purses, and start up a Na
tional bank. We will say that they
capitalize the bank at $50,000. We
will suppose that they put all of this
in bonds. Having’ been duly organized
into a National bank, these patriots
present their bonds to Uncle Sam, and
he issues to them a dollar in money
for every dollar represented in the
bonds. If bonds to the amount of
$50,000 are presented, the patriots get
$50,000 in notes .which the law says
are to circulate as money.
The patriots then lend out this $50,-
000 to the patrons of the bank, com
pounding the interest from time to
time, after the comfortable custom of
banks.
Now don’t you see that by incor
porating themselves as a National
bank these four patriots HAVE DOU
BLED THEIR CAPITAL?
They don’t lose either the princi
pal, or the interest, of the $50,000 in
vested in the bonds, and they get the
$50,000 in money practically free of.
cost.
Therefore, the first favor which the
law grants to the National banker is
that of doubling his capital.
The law docs not do that for you,
does it? You would not vote for such
i a law, would you?
But you vote for the two old par
ties which heartily support that law;
consequently you are to blame toi the
law.
You can readily understand that the
Ueffersonian
$50,000 in money, given to the Na
tional bank by the Government, earns
at least 12 per cent. The legal rate of
interest is not s© much as that, but
you must remember that banks dis
count notes, compound interest, charge
exchange rates and have various little
•‘tricks of trade,” all ®f which make
for the good of the banker.
Now, let us turn to that other field
in which the same $50,000 is at work,
under a different name. Let us con
sider the bonds. Uncle Sam stores
these away as security for that $50,-
000 of money which he has loaned to
the bank, practically without interest.
At the same time that the banker is
drawing interest from the borrowers
who apply to him for a part/bf that
$50,000 of money, he is also dravzing
interest from the same borrowers, rep
resented by their government, on the
bonds.
The borrowers pay interest directly
to the bank on the borrowed money,
and the Government takes from these
same borrowers the taxes which meet
the interest on the bonds.
What makes the bonds good? The
credit of the Government. And who
supports the credit of the Govern
ment? I’he taxpayers. So, you see,
the borrowers furnish the security up-*
on which the National banking system
is based, AND THEY NOT ONLY
ALLOW THE BANKERS TO DOU
BLE THEIR CAPITAL, BUT THEY
PAY INTEREST ON THE SAME
MONEY TWICE.
No wonder that one of these bank
ers can put twelve million dollars in
pictures and then pay ten million dol
lars for a palace to use as a store
room for his treasures of art.
The $50,000, working in the bond
field, while the same fund is at work
in the loan field-, earns interest paya
ble in gold only, and this interest is
almost always paid in advance. Be
sides, the $50,000 in the bond field,
escapes taxation. Even the town coun
cil can not tax it. This seems incred
ible, I know, but it is a gladdening
fact, —not only gladdening to the ban
ker, but to others who can’t help re
joicing that there is something that a
town council can’t tax.
Not only does the $50,000 in bonds
draw interest and escape taxation, but
it is insured against all risks. IT IS
A MORTGAGE UPON THE NA
TION. Burglars can’t reach it; fire
and flood and pestilence do it no harm;
the army and the navy are its guar
antors; the laws and the courts are
its firm defenders; the Government it
self must perish before the fortune
invested in the bonus is jeopardized.
What is that insurance worth to
the capitalist? Lt costs him nothing
and it is of inestimable value to him.
There are so many rich rascals who
would like to put their money where it
will safe, that I have long
been of the opinion that the United
States could float long term, non-in
terest bearing bonds at par.
The protection to the capital, and
the exemption from taxation, would
cause such victorious marauders as
Morgan and Harriman and Rockefel-"
ler to leap at the chance to put their
spoil beyond the reach of confiscation.
But there is still another advantage
which accrues to Smith and his asso
ciated patriots when they organize
themselves into a National bank.
They get the money of the borrow-
