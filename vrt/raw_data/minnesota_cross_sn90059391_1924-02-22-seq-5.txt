REPUBLICANS NOT PLANNING
TO DITCH JOHNSON MEASURE
Senator Dictates Statement to Correspondent of Klan’s
Washington News Bureau, Recalling Former Fights
on Immigration Restriction Bills.
Foreign Language Press, Representatives From Foreign-Populated
States, and Small (iroups of Aliens Trying to Exert Large Influ
ence in Opposition.
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 14.—Representative Albert Johnson,
chairman of the house committee on immigration, today told the
writer with emphasis that the Republican chiefs in this city are
not planning to shelve the immigration bill. He says such talk
always comes up about this time, right after an immigration bill
has been introduced in the house and while it is waiting its turn
on the floor.
Representative Johnson dictated the following statement for
the writer:
"Professional leaders of foreign
blocs, aided by paid leaders of other
groups which benefit from the con
tinued arrival of aliens, are now bold
ly proclaiming that they have beaten
the proposals for restrictive immi
gration legislation this year, and
that all we may expect to secure is
a continuation of the 3 per cent act
for one more year. I am positive
that the opponents will not be that
successful.
‘The public, however, should under
stand that if congress can be co
erced, by threats from these repre
sentatives of aliens, to lay aside the
pending restrictive bill, so that their
followers may swarm into the coun
try, the time will soon come when
the people of the United States will
have lost all control of their own af
fairs. This is an internal, domestic
problem. It is a vital problem. It
concerns the future of our country.
It must not be controlled by foreign
language newspapers and other alien
influences. No threat of political
sabotage to be worked by aliens in
sny state or against any political
party can be permitted to defeat its
consideration. The people of the
United States must take hold of it
and deal with it as it deserves to be
dealt with, or they will see their
American institutions fade and dis
appear under an avalanche of alien
thought, alien purpose and alien
power.
"America must be kept American.
Perfection of restrictive immigra
tion laws must be established now.

difficult.”
How Pressure is Put on
Chairman Johnson today admitted
that all sorts of pressure is being
brought to bear, but he says: “I have
been a member of this immigration
committee for fifteen years, and we
have about the same thing to contend
with every time an immigration bill
comes up. We hear from about the
same kind of people, and pressure is
exerted from about the same sort of
sources each time. Certain interests
are always against us in this matter.
We hear from the churches and Sun
day schools in behalf of letting the
Armenians and Syrians come in;
there is the naturalized alien ele
ment wanting more of their people
over here and they work against an
immigration bill, of course; take the
foreign language newspapers, we al
ways have them against us; then there
are certain manufacturing interests
who maintain their own associations
or organizations whose business it is
to get labor, foreign labor, into this
country, and they are always work
ing against an immigration bill, un
less we were willing to throw wide
open the gates and bid all come in.”
Chairman Johnson says the country
can covint sure on an immigration
bill this year, no matter how strong
is the pressure to present. He fig
ures that the quota law will be re
enacted and he hopes to keep In the
bill the requirement of examination
at all ports of embarkation. He ad
mits that a compromise may be
forced as between 1890 and 1910 with
respect to the quota. But he also
says he is absolutely convinced that
the two per cent will be kept in the
bill, and not a return to three per
cent as in the present law. He de
nies that his plan has been abandoned
for this session. He says such talk
is the result of propaganda from
those opposing restrictive immigra
tion.
Chairman Johnson denied that he
ever hoped to have his immigration
bill considered on the floor of the
house ahead of the tax reduction bill,
which is on right now. He did have
hopes of having immigration follow
immediately the tax reduction meas
ure, but says a slight switch has been
made in order to pacify the south
ern fellows and keep them from talk
ing to death and consuming too much
time with the bill. A deal is
said to have been made with the
southern crowd to bring in right af
ter the tax bill the Muscle Shoals
proposition, and such a program has
now been agreed upon. Chairman
Johnson says it is his understanding
that the immigration bill is to follow
the Muscle Shoals measure, and he
predicts that the immigration bill
will be reached in about thirty days
from the present time. It is esti
mated now that it will take from
three to four weeks to get through
the tax reduction bill and the Muscle
Shoals measure, then will come in
the immigration measure in say four
weeks from now. Mr. Johnson will
not agree that the bonus measure is
likely to crowd the immigration bill
back one more notch on the program.
He is of the opinion that the bonus
may come later on in the session,
but is not ready now, therefore, it
will not crowd back the immigration

What to Count on
Davis Joins League
Neutral Commission
NOMAN H. DAVIS
Mr. Davis has joined the neutral
commission of the league of nations,
to investigate the Memel controversy.
He is president of the commission,
and takes the post in an unofficial
capacity, having no connection with
the United States government. Mr.
Davis was former under-secretary of
state and financial adviser of the
American delegation to the Paris
peace conference in 1918-1919.
measure any farther on the program.
Yes, Chairman Johnson admits that
the pressure is being put on. but the
squeeze play won’t work if the people
of the country will only get busy and
back up congress right now. It is
true that congressmen representing
foreign centers in New York. Penn
sylvania, Minnesota, Illinois, Wiscon
sin, Michigan and elsewhere are being
bombarded from home. Of course
they are. The same thing always
happens when an immigration bill is
up for action. These fellows are even
going so far as to predict that the
passage of the Johnson bill will cost
the Republican party thousands of
votes, etc., but party leaders have
heard the same things before.
Fighting Johnson Kill
The Johnson bill is being fought by
the Catholics, the Jews, the. Italians,
and foreigners of all nations. These
fellows are undertaking to scare Re
publican leaders by declaring that an
overturn of votes may result in the
passage of the bill and swing normal
ly Republican states into the Demo
cratic column. That old game is be
ing worked for all there is in it.
Representative La Guardia, of New
York City, is one contending for them
that the foreign vote of New York
City might prove a determining fac
tor in the coming presidential elec
tion. A flood of'protests against the
Johnson bill which bears heavily on
the Jewish and Italian quota have
reached congress. Italian lodges of
Schenectady, Buffalo and New York
City have framed resolutions charg
ing that the bill is discriminatory.
Even Justice S. A. Cottillow, of the
New York Supreme Court, prominent
in Italian state organizations, has
submitted a memorandum on the bill.
It has come in pamphlet form to the
president, members of the cabinet,
and senators and representatives in
congress. Everybody got them.
As stated by this writer before.
Representative Dickstein, of New
York, is preparing a minority report
for the Democratic members of the
immigration committee. Dickstein
favors a nextension of the present
law until a commission has more
carefully studied the problem.
Going Ahead With Bill
It is now predicted that there are
eneugh southern Democrats who will
combine with the Republican regu
lars and put through the Johnson
bill. It is not believed, at least by
Chairman Johnson, that the debate
will leave sufficient scars td hurt his
Earty in the presidential election.
[e predicts the immigration measure
will be up for passage on the floor
of the house within thirty days.
GOVERNOR’S RACE
WILL BE BATTLE
Cohtinued from page 1
the Railroad and Warehouse Commis
sion. The fact that he was appoint
ed to this place by Gov. Preus, some
contend, won’t help him any should
he seek the governorship. Mr. Bowen
is an ex-service man, serving as a
captain of field artillery with the
Eighty-ninth Division. Every person
that I have met claiming to know
Bowen intimately speaks well of him.
He attended the public schools of
Nicollet and Blue Earth counties.
He is a Republican.
Once in a while R. P. Chase, state
auditor bobs up as a possible guber
natorial candidate. He was born at
Anoka, this state. He was graduated
from the University of Minnesota and
the St. Paul College of Law. He
succeeded Gov. Preus when the latter
was elected state executive receiving
the appointment to the state auditor
ship from the Governor, January
1921 and was elected to the place in
1922.
Mayor Arthur E. Nelson is not in
frequently brought forward as a pos
sible candidate for governor. Should
he be re-elected mayor with a sub
stantial lead, he then would become
a strong contender for the Republi
can nomination. Mr. Nelson proved
a strong vote getter when he was
elected mayor of the Saintly City.
Many seem to think that he will re
peat his former vote pulling record
in the coming mayoralty contest.
In the past, Hon. W. I. Nolan has
been considered a gubernatorial pos
sibility and he may come forward as
such this year. Mr. Nolan is a na
tive of Minnesota. He received his
education in the common schools of
Minneapolis. As a lecturer he is
widely known, having appeared on
the Lyceum and Chautauqua plat
forms throughout the nation. He
served as speaker of the lower house
of the Minnesota legislature in the
1919, 1921 and 1923 sessions. He is
a Republican.
THE FIERY CROSS
In Red Wing lives a man that not
a few careful political observers
think can win the governorship eas
ily. That man is Jens. K. Grondahl,
editor and manager of a daily news
paper. the Red Wing Republican. Mr.
Grondahl has a pretty good record
as a legislator. It is pointed out that
he, with his record and a large num
ber of friends over the state, can win
because it will be difficult to present
anything of a serious nature against
his candidacy. The Red Wing man
is of Norwegian parentage, and that
means something in Minnesota poli
tics. Mr. Grondahl is a self-made
man.
The Ramsey county coroner, Dr. C.
A. Ingerson, will in all probability be
boomed as a candidate for governor.
It is possible that his refusal to be
come a candidate for mayor of St.
Paul against the present incumbent,
Mayor Nelson, had something to do
with an ambition to become gover
nor. A goodly number of business
and professional men, as well as
tradesmen, think that the Ramsey
county coroner showed splendid po
litical judgment in staying out of
the Capital City race for the mayor
ship. Should he have become a candi
date for mayor and been defeated, he
would have eliminated himself as a
Eotential candidate for governor.
►r. Ingerson is of Scandinavian de
scent. It is alleged that the Doctor
would seek the support of the Farm
er-l.abor party in the event he en
tered the race for the governorship.
It is now generally admitted that
United States Senator Magnus John
son will not consider the governor
ship. Dispatches from Washington
report statements of the junior sen
ator wherein he expresses a desire
to run for re-election. Those who
are close to Johnson state definitely
that the Kimball farmer will not
pive the governor’s chair even pass
ing attention.
The candidacy of A. C. Townley is
not taken seriously. It might seem
strange to some that his name is even
mentioned in Minnesota politics as
a candidate for a political office. We
have been associating Townley with
North Dakota politics nearly entire
ly except wherein he supported can
didates in this state in an official
capacity as the head of the Non- Par
tisan League. However, he is a cit
izen of Minnesota and has been for
some time.
Mayor George Leach of Minneapo
lis, I find, may seek the endorsement
of the Farmer-Labor party and make
a determined run for governor. But
with stronger men available, it is
not likely that the Farmer-Labor
party will risk the defeat of its can
didates by supporting the .Hour City
mayor, who has much opposition in
his home community—the city of
Minneapolis, as well as over the state.
Hon. Charles Lindbergh of Little
Falls also looms as a formidable can
didate for governor on the Farmer-
Labor ticket.
Will Edward Indrehus seek the gov
ernorship via the Democratic party
this year? This is a frequently asked
question. Maybe Frank Day of Fair
mont can give us the correct answer
to the query. Indrehus appears the
most likely nominee of the Demo
cratic party, it is said.
The supporters of James. A. Carley
think that he will nose out Indrehus
for the Democratic 4 nomination and
capture the governorship in a three
cornered fight. There are not a few
on the other hand to say that Carley
will not want to be a candidate for
governor, preferring, if a candidate
at all, to make an effort for the place
now held by Magnus Johnson.
Judge Comstock of Mankato has
not been forgotten by the Democrats
of this state. There are many who
would like to see him come forward
for the governorship again. Whether
or not the judge cares to once more
try his luck in the larger political
field is not definitely known, al
though I have heard that Comstock
is satisfied to remain on the district
bench. But possibly if he comes to
think that the political dope going
the rounds has any foundation, he
may step forth as a gubernatorial
candidate. The dope points to a vic
tory by the Democrats in a bitter
fight between the Republicans and
the Farmer-Laborites, which will
split things just enough to make mat
ters lovely for whoever carries the
standard of the Jeffersonians.
The coming gubernatorial contest
will be a battle royal, filled with sur
prises, both in June and November.
There is no doubt but that the wool
will fly In every direction, with the
fight growing fiercely hot on the
home stretch. The Minnesota Fiery
Cross will watch the political pot as
it boils, and fearlessly call a spade a
spade. For the first time in many a
year the voter will be able to get
the facts without fear and favor.
The Newer Journalism
A new journalism- of doubtful
merit—has displaced the excellent
papers of a generation or more ago,
according to Arthur Reed Kimball in
Scribner’s. “It is a far cry,” he
writes, from Charles A. Dana’s New
York Sun of more than thirty years
ago, a model of the best journalism,
even though often emphasizing the
trivial human-interest story, a paper
confined to four pages, but contain
ing in succinct pnrase all real news
of the city and of the world, and.
above all, distinguished in style, to
the bulky paper of today, often slop
py in style and redundant and exag
gerated in rhetoric, with its editorial
comments buried on some inside page,
where they have to be searched out
if the reader perchance cares to find
them. This cnange, applying equal
ly to provincial and metropolitan
journalism, is due first of all to the
discovery of the value of display ad
vertising.”
“Obviously," Mr,. Kimball goes on to
say, “the number of pages surren
dered to advertising requires inter
spersing among them of a great
amount of reading matter to draw at
tention to the advertising. This leads
to the introduction of all kinds of
articles, which may have nothing to
do with the presentation of the day's
news, turning the daily newspaper in
to a cheap magazine, a catch-all for
anything and everything.”
ANTI-KLAN ORGANIZATIONS STILL SQUABBLE
IN OKLAHOMA; FINANCES WORRY THEM ALL
(Oklahoma Slate letter.)
OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 20—The
anti-Klan Associations of Oklahoma
have organized and reorganized four
times, and yet another organization
meet has been called for February
23, as the call states, “for perman
ent organization."
The “gravest” problem facing the
antis is an agreement as to who will
handle the money. In this they have
failed utterly to date. Reports
reaching your correspondent leave
the impression with an outsider that
each is afraid of the other, in hand
ling of funds.
Another element of discord is the
method 6t securing funds with which
to keep “body and soul together.”
Reports have it that one element
seeks to have the farmer and labor
organizations as allies and tb ac
complish this they wish a strong
plank endorsing labor, hoping there
by to ensnare the labor vote for pol
itical purposes. To date, however,
this program has met with poor suc
cess
On the other hand another element
wants to defer any reference to la
borers and farmers with the hope
that the large corporations with
“plenty of money” will come, to the
financial rescue. This move is being
backed by J. C. Walton and his polit
ical backers. It is said that Walton
wishes to dominate the antis with a
platform of $6.00 admission fees,
with SI.OO for his so-called anti-Klan
paper, the remaining $5.00 to be ap
plied to “overhead expense" in Wal
ton’s Loyal Freemen of America.
There is still another element, re-

reau. Its work will be unhampered
by any outside influence. It will tell
the truth of the conditions in Wash
ington as they exist, and report af
fairs. truthfully and impartially, as
they arise. Then it is up to Mr. Av
erage Voter to make up his mind
“what is to be done about it,” and
act accordingly.
Only by an intelligent, moral public
opinion can a democracy exist. Of
late years, the American people have
been lacking in truthful information
upon which to build such an “intel
ligent, moral public opinion.” It is
the prime purpose of the Bureau to
furnish that information. Protestant
Americans of Minnesota can get it
through the columns of the Minneso
ta Fiery Cross, while their daily pa
pers continue to worry themselves
over minor, local political scraps,
sensational murders, and divorce
“news.”
There are now in the United States
30 different Klan publications under
the direction and supervision of the
Washington Bureau. The news serv
ice and editorial service of this de
partment, which has been rightly
called “the nerve center” of the or
ganization is open to any newspapers
that care to take it.
Expert Editors
A corps of editors experts in their
respective, special fields —has been
gatnered together. The product of
their pens will appear regularly in
the Minnesota Fiery Cross. The best
trained political observers in the na
tion are keeping constant watch on
the senators and representatives and
all the departments of the govern
mental machinery, for the benefit of
The Minnesota Fiery Cross readers.
The men best qualified to interpret
national affairs editorially have been
added to the staff. Specialists in
matters of the public schools, text
books and other subjects of prime
importance and intefest are devoting
their entire time to the Bureau.
It is through the Bureau that the
national Klan organization hopes to
accomplish one of its greatest tasks
—that of arousing the American
electorate to a full understanding of
the things which directly concern
it, so the present, public evils
which beset the nation may soon be
remedied. ,
But to return to Minnesota—let u
be stated at this time that a similar
policy will be pursued in regard to
Klan and public affairs in this state.
It will be the policy of this paper at
all times to be pro-American. pro-
Protestant and pro-Klan. ln .

the time has come for all good Prot

into the world’s greatest nation. It
is the mission of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan of Minnesota to weld
into one operative body the Protest
ant Americans of the state. And to
ward that end The Minnesota Fiery

ferred to by some as the “clothes
line” party which hopes to build up
a political machine under the name
of anti-Klan with an admission fee
of SSO. This they claim, will bring
in all the “clothes line” variety and
build a huge political machine with
which to fight the Klan in the com
ing elections, city, county and
state.
From the best information ob
tainable by your correspondent, it is
evident that the thought uppermost
in the minds of the “leaders” and
“founders" of the anti-Klan associa
tions is the money which they hope
to make out of their different or
ganizations. They are using the Klan
issue as a side line to further their
ends, financially and politically, and
at this writing they seem to be al
most at the “parting of the ways.”
The first State organization in
Oklahoma City was officered by a
“red” socialist for president; a vice
president who had been convicted of
bootlegging and paid a fine as the
penalty; and an ex-minister for sec
retary-treasurer, who had been kick
ed out of his church and forced to
vacate his parsonage by order of the
presiding elder of the district.
The Klans of Oklahoma are “kluck
ing” as never before in the history
of that Realm. According to Grand
Dragon N. C. Jewett the Klans of
Oklahoma are 50 per cent stronger
now than they were in 1922 and ev
ery Klan in the state is growing
stronger with each pasing week.
The slogan of the Klan in Oklahoma
is “300,000 Members in 1924.”

Klan News Notes
From All Parts
of Buckeye State
COLUMBUS. 0., Feb. 19 —When the
principles and purposes of the Ku
Klux Klan are thoroughly understood
by every true American, there will
be no opposition to the movement
except from the forces that made the
Klan necessary in America, the Rev.
Frank G. Markley, pastor of the
Lindenwald M. E. church, Hamilton,
0., declared in a sermon recently. He
said the day was not far off when
the Klan would be publicly vindi
cated.
Safety Director McCune, of Colum
bus, 0., refuses to take the word of
a bootlegger against he word of a po
liceman when the policeman’s job is
at stake. A patrolman recently was
suspended by the chief of police on
the testimony of a bootlegger that
the policeman has accepted bribes
from bootleggers. McCune ordered
him reinstated unless other proof
could be obtained.
The report of Attorney General
Crabbe of Ohio to Governor Donahey
that law enforcement conditions have
greatly improved at Steubenville, 0..
is regarded by many persons of
Steubenville as merely an attempt
to whitewash the local administra
tion for political purposes. Liquor
laws are Deing violated openly, it is
said. Crabbe said recently it was
simply impossible to enforce the
laws strictly at Steubenville because
of the large foreign population.
Bellaire, 0., recently awoke to the
fact that the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan are still active in this commun
ity, notwithstanding that the oppo
sition had begun to say that the Klan
was “through.” A demonstration
took place on one of the most disa
greeable nights of the winter, when
rain was pouring in torrents. Hun
dreds of persons were attracted by a
big burning cross on a hill where it
could be seen from practically every
part of the city, and an immense
crowd turned out to attend a meet
ing of the Klan.
