the building were quickly followed by

the fifty-five inmates escaped.
‘ The constitutional convention, after
completing its work of drawing up a
set of laws to govern the proposed
new state of Oklahoma, adjourned sine
die Thursday. The constitution as pre
pared will be submitted to the people

Saturday the president issued an ex
ecutive order fixing the compensation
of Major Sibert and Major Gaillard,
of the army, and Civil Engineer Rous
seau, of the navy, as members of the
Isthmian canal commission. These of
ficers are to receive $14,000 a year
each, including their pay as officers
of the branches of the service which
they now occupy.

Saturday the Porto Rican house of
delegates unanimously adopted a reso
lution, introduced by Luis Munos Ri
vera, leader of the Unionist party, de
manding self-government for Porto Ri
co. The resolution, which is to be
forwarded to President Roosevelt, is
to be printed in several languages and
mailed to foreign countries for distri
bution there.
Governor Folk is quoted as saying
that he will soon issue a call for a
special session of the legislature, to
consider measures for the regulation
of the public utilities, corporations
and dram shops. Bills covering these
subjects and favored by the governor
were killea by the session which has
just ended.
n
Two large railroad construction eon
tracts at Omaha suspended and al
most a thousand men withdrawn from
jobs, one of them nearing completion,
are evidence of the sincerity of the *
, retrenchment policy of the Harriman
<7 lines. The absolute impossibility of
a raising the funds to carry on the work
is the reason given by Vice President
Mohler for the action taken.
Complying with petitions presented
by numerous commercial organizations
of the Mississippi Valley, President
Roosevelt has decided to appoint an
inland waterway commission, whose
duty it will be to prepare a compre
hensive plan for the .improvement and
control of the river systems of the
United States. Eight public men have
been asked to serve on the* commis
sion, and Representative Theodore H.
Burton, of Ohio, chairman of the rivers...
and harbors committee in the last
congress, is to be chairman.
