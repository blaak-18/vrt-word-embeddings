INDIANOLA, IA., April 25
AH Warren county is talking
about the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan and their program today.
Last night a public mass meet
ing was held in the court room of
the district court, when Rev. N.
C. Carpenter of the Capitol Hill
Church of Christ, Des Moines, de
livered a masterful address on
Klan aims and principles.
Approximately 500 people from
this community, surrounding county
and from Des Moines filled the court
room to overflowing. Many stood
around the walls and in the hallway,
to listen to the message of the Klan.
Tells of Old Klan
Rev. Mr. Carpenter outlined the
flistory of the organization, starting
with the old Klan. There were false
atories spread about the activities of
the old organization, just as propa
ganda to discredit the present organi
sation is spread, he said. The old
Klan preyed upon the superstition of
the southern negro, when every effort
was being made to disfranchise the
white man and establish a black su
premacy below the Mason-Dixon line.
The new Klan seeks to prevent the
enemies of America from getting in
to places of power and ruining the na
tion, declared the speaker. He re
ferred to foreign immigration, the
plot to overthrow the public system,
which is the most democratic insti
tution in the world, and the forces
working to undermine the American
home.
Every Klansman stands pledged to
protect the public school system of
the United States, every Klansman is
honor and duty-bound to uphold the
constitution. Every member of this
organization is four-square behind a
erogram of law and order enforced
y the duly constituted officers of
the law, said Rev. Mr. Carpenter.
Problems Brought Home
These are problems facing the Unit
ed States, facing lowa, facing War
ren county and Indianola,” continued
the speaker. “You Americans of In
dinola cannot shirk your duty to
yourselves and other Americans. You
cannot sit idly by while the rest of
the nation fights your battles.”
Rev. Mr. Carpenter answered many
questions that occur in tjie mind of
tne non-member when the Ku Klux
Klan is referred to. He denounced
the corrupt daily press of the day
and the sensation-mongering maga
zines which are endeavoring ineffec-

tually to discredit the Klan and the
principles for which it stands.
“Many of you are wondering about
the mask, as you call it,” he said. I
ask you which mask is made of the
thinnest veneer: the Klan’s, which is
a piece of white cloth, or the smoke
screen mask made up of thousands of
deluded human beings, controlled by
the arch-enemies of the Klan and of
Amreica?
Mask of Honor
“We wear the mask in honor of the
old Klansmen, who saved the south
land and therefore the north, from
black supremacy which was being pro
mulgated by degenerate white politi
cians.
“We wear the mask because it is
good sense to do so. It is common

FILM IS DISGRACE
While 500 Americans were gath
ered in the court room of the
Warren county court house at In
dianola Thursday evening listen
ing to a lecture on the Ku Klux
Klan, a film was being shown at
the Empress theater, the only mov
ing picture house in Indianola,
which was a disgrace to every
white man and woman in the com
munity. The picture was “Bella
Donna,” in which Pola Negri, the
star, is frequently seen in the em
braces of her black lover. Where
the Klan is organized—that is,
where Protestant Americans stand
together for united action —that
film is not shown. It had a short
lived run in Indianapolis and in
other Indiana and Ohio cities
where the order is strong. There
is need of a strong Klan in War
ren county.
nation to keep your identity and vour
numbers secret. What would you have
thought of General Pershing in the
World war, had he notified the Ger
mans that he had so many men in a
front line sector and at such and
such a time was going to strike at a
certain specified place? Such an idea
is foolish. It is likewise foolish to
tell the enemies of America where the
Klan is going to strike or who we are
or how many of us there are.”
Scores Fair Board
The Kleagle of Warren and Polk
counties, who introduced Rev. Mr.
Carpenter referred to the action of
the state fair board in refusing Polk
county Klansmen the use of the pig
pen at the state fair grounds for a
large meeting recently. He compared
their action to that of Warren coun
ty officials in allowing American cit
izens the use of the court room. The
Kleagle predicted that unless the
state fair board changed its attitude
between now and next fall, there
would be a lot of county fairs and
even the state fair which would not
be patronized by American farmers
and visitors.
At the close of the lecture, the
crowd went to a field on the north
edge of Indianola. Following the ex
plosion of two aerial bombs, a huge
fiery cross was lighted. Red flares
were placed around it in star for
mation.
At the annual meeting of the Board
of Sunday schools of the Methodist
Episcopal church, held in Chicago,
February 6-8, large increase in the
schools and pupils was reported.
There are now 36,982 schools, with
416,875 officers and teachers, 3,896,-
047 pupils. This represents a gain
in four years of 814 schools, and 437,-
610 pupils.

LEGISLATIVE NOTES
What the lowa Legislators Are
Doing at Special Session
For Code Revision
The compromise budget bill was
swept through the house by a vote of
63 to 35 after a three and one-half
hour debate. Practically every mem
ber of the house agreed on the pas
sage of the sections relating to the
budgeting of state funds, but repre
sentatives Berry of Monroe, Rassler
of Pocahontas and Criswell of Boone
fought the adoption of the committee
report for over three hours. The con
ference report on the budget bill was
no. amendable. The importance at
tached to the bill and the compara
tive speed with which the compro
mise measure passed the house Is tak
en as an indication that the bill will
be passed by the senate. If the bill
is passed by the senate the first bud
get report for the state will be sub
mitted to the forty-first assembly
when it convenes next November. The
bill, as it was passed by thme house
provides for one director of the bud
get, a state budget system, board of
appeal, and a local budget system to
apply to all municipalities.
The scheme of collecting the laws
to be published in the new code has
virtually been decided upon. It is
now proposed to gather up the sec
tions of the compiled code, which
have not been modified by the special
session and dovetail the sections mo
dified in the code revision bills with
them and publish the whole volume as
the new code. This session has dealt
with only about a third of the sec
tions of the compiled code, which was
a compilation of the existing laws
deemed unnecessary to revise.
lowa will go under the budget me
thod of control of public finances both
state and local within the year as
the result of the final adoption in the
legislature of the compromise budget
bill, drafted by the conference com
mittee of the two houses. The pro
visions of the bill are very similar to
those of the federal budget law. The
house passed the bill by a vote of 63
to 35 and the senate followed suit by
approving it by a vote of 29 to 15.
The eugenics marriage bill met de
feat when the senate adopted the third
conference committee report on the
measure, which eliminates all refer
ence to the subject from the marriage
and incest bill. The house previous
ly had adopted the same report. The
measure now goes to the governor in
virtually the same form in which it
was submitted by the code commis
sion.
The budget bill as passed by the
House creates the office of director of
the budget, who will be nominated by
the governor and appointed by the
senate to serve a six-year term. If
the present bill passes the senate, the
first director of the budget will be
appointed prior to July 1, 1924. He
will serve until July 1, 1927. The du
ties of director of the budget Include
the preparation of a state budget, con
sideration and recommndation of lo
cal budgets, and investigation of state
departments.
State sale of gasoline, proposed by
Representative Ontjes of Grundy
county was lightly treated in the
house and Ontjes amendment was de
feated by a vote of 8 to 70. The Ont
jes proposal was a modification of the
South Dakota plan. It provided for
the sale by the executive council of
gasoline, fuel oil and coal whenever
the council deemed unfair discrimina
tion was being made or pools and
trusts maintained.
Consideration of a bill to compel a
showing of necessity in the applica
tion to railroad commissioners for
the establishment of bus lines, was
refused by the lower house of the
state legislature when the bill failed
by a wide margin to gain the neces
sary two-thirds majority to permit ita
Introduction. The existing law re
quires bus companies to show only
that the bus lines they wish to es
tablish will be conrenlence to the pub
lic.
Thirty-two bills remain to be acted
on before recess. Of these eleven are
not code revision bills. They are
mainly legalizing acts. The twenty
one remaining code revision bills must
be disposed of to complete code revi
sion. Ten of these bills interlock
with each other and each must be
passed in the revision order of things.
Six bills, all of which are affected by
the budget bill, cannot be acted on
until the budget bill is passed.
This code revising session will
doubtless be lowa’s last. It is intend
ed to be, for the present session has
passed a law providing for the pub
ication of a new code every four years
and for keeping up the revision from
session to session. In every odd num
bered session hereafter session laws
will be printed and in every even
numbered session a new code, embody
ing the previous sessions laws will be
published.
The house concurred with the sen
ate in passing the verbose and tech
nical bill on future estates.
An act to legalize the special elec
tion held at Valley Junction when vot
ers authorised a bond issue for $20,-
000 for the purpose of extending the
waterworks system, passed the house
of representatives.

**************
Passage of the budget bill by the
lowa legislature constitutes one of
the most constructive pieces of legis
lation enacted in this state in many
years. This one action alone justi
fies the existence of this special ses
sion of the legislature and the solons
who voted for the measure merit the
highest commendation from their con
stituencies. Signing of the bill by
Governor Kendall will enact it into
law and set in motion the machinery
which will save the taxpayers of lowa
millions of dollars and should result
in a very material reduction in the
tax levy within a few years. The
legislature is to be congratulated up
on having passed a budget bill that is
comprehensive and has plenty of teeth.
It is a budget law not only in name
but in fact as well.
The lowa senate refused to grant
any concessions to the house
in the road graveling bill by refusing
to concur in any of the house amend
ments. The house amendments strike
out all of the provisions placed In the
law by the senate to meet federal aid
requirements. The house amend
ments also would eliminate the addi
tional authority of passing on all road
Improvement projects, which the sen
ate delegated to the commission. An
other feature of the house changes
which the senate objected to is the
amendment limiting bond Issues for
graveling of roads to one-half the col
lectible revenue from any road levies,
and requiring bond elections !n coun
ties of less than $700,000 to carry in
both the city and country districts.
Charges by Senator James L.
Brookhart, of Washington county,
that senators were hiding out in cloak
rooms in conference with “paid-lob
byists” during discussion of a public
utilities bill threw the upper body in
to confusion and drew a storm of de
nials from several solons. Senator
Brookhart’s accusations followed his
demand that the rule excluding lob
byists from the floor of the Senate be
enforoed. His amendment striking
out 50-year franchises for electric
trunk lines had been adopted by a
narrow margin.
Just when the code will be ready
for distribution is a subject of con
siderable difference of opinion, the
probable time varying from October
Ist next to January Ist, 1924, It is
probable that the legislature will re
cess until July Ist. That date would
contemplate the delivery of the code
October Ist. If it should turn out
that the code cannot be finished Oct.
Ist, the legislature might recess again
until August Ist or a month or so
later. There is some prospect that
the code will be ready by November
Ist, at the latest.
Preparations are under way for a re
cess for the legislature until a date
to be fixed in the summer or fall,
when the legislature will reassemble
to adopt the new code. This date will
be fixed after conference between the
code revision committees of the two
houses, the code commissioners and
the state printing board to determine,
as nearly as possible, when the code
will be printed and bound ready for
distribution. The new code will go
into effect ninety days after the final
adjournment of the special session.
The senate refused to accept any
of the house modifications of the pro
visions for submitting the question of
voting bonds for gravelling roads, af
ter discussing them more or less heat
edly for four hours. This refusal will
send the bill to conference committee,
and may, it is declared in the house,
result in the death of any changes in
the law to permit referendum votes rn
the issuance of graveling bonds at this
session.
Unlike regular sess/ons, nearly alt
the bills not finally disposed of now
are in conference commlttocs. It is
unusual for more than two or three
bills to go to conference committees
in a regular session. Amendments to
code revision bills are responsible for
the conference. Many conference re
ports have been rejected and new com
mittees have been appointed. All
these things require time.

ANTI-PROTESTANT
PROPAGANDA SEEN
IN MANY MOVIES
‘The White Sister* Disgusts
Protestant Americans—
Church Beautified
ASK FAIR TREATMENT
lowa Needs Censor Board That
Will Live IJp to its Name
in All Ways
Americans of Des Moines are dis
gusted with the piece of propaganda
exhibited in this city at a down-town
theater, in the form of entertain
ment, known as ‘The White Sister/'
Never during the war was a bet
ter bit of propaganda put over for
war purposes, than is “The White
Sister" for the purpose it serves —
that of beautifying the Roman Catho
lic church and the life of a nun.
The storv is well laid, the scenes
were taken in Italy, and there are
many dramatic ana tense moments
in the picture, all of which serve on
ly to enhance its value as propa
ganda.
Compare, for example, the digni
fied picture of the clergy as present
ed in ‘The White Sister,” as against
the portrayal of Protestant ministers
fn some recent Western films that
have lately been shown in Des
Moines. Tne minister in “Heritage
of the Desert” is an example.
It is not that Protestant Americans
want Catholic clergymen cut entire
ly out of the films. All they ask is
that the dignity of their spiritual
leaders be upheld as much as that of
the Roman church —that they be giv
en fair and equal treatment.
Pictures could be devoted to an ed
ucational end and at the same time
be of entertaining value, if the prop
aganda were left out. But no, the
lowest tastes of the general public
must be pleased. In the much ad
vertised film, ‘The Hunchback of No
tre Dame,” from the classic by Vic
tor Hugo, the public is catered to
and the book forgotten. Victor Hu
gu wrote only fragments of that pic
ture. It gives anyone who has not
read the classic an erroneous im
pression of the story. It is done only
to please the public with a “sugaif
and water” happy ending.
lowa, especially the youth of lowa,
could be servde to good advantage by
a censor board. One of the best Ar
guments that has recently appeared
on the screen for the establishment
of such an institution is “Three
Weeks,” which recently played to ca
pacity houses here. The degeneracy
of the picture, its effect upon adoles
cent youths, cannot be overlooked.
Parents complain because their
sons and daughters attend such
shows. But the sons and daughters
are not to blame. If parents do not
wish their children to witness such
production—and no parents with the
welfare of their chlidren on their
hearts do—they should see that such
productions are not shown. They
should demand and work for the es
tablishment of a censor board that
censors.
Entire Nation Protests
Against False Pictures
(Bureau of Publication and Kduratlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C., April 28
The Protestant Americans, and this
takes in the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, are getting their dander up
over the way the motion picture peo
ple of the country have been putting
over things on them in the moving
picture films that are being shown
every day and night in the picture
houses of the country.
The Bureau of Publication and Ed
ucation has had something to say on
this subject before, and favorable re
action is just beginning to come, as
per the Florida protest below. It
has come to a point where Protest
ants of America are getting together
and standing together on this aues
tion in a united way. And it’s about
time, for it seems that the producers
of these films have gone to seed on
non-Protestant propaganda and have
taken rather a delight in portraying
life in a one-sided view, which is fa
vorable to Catholics and seeks to
portray Protestants in a ridiculous
and undignified manner.
Protest from Florida
The following protest has been sent
out officially from Fort Pierce Klan
No. 86, Realm of Florida:
“Be it Resolved: That Fort Pierce
Klan No. 85, Realm of Florida.
Knights o fthe Ku Klux Klan does
hereby go on record as being bitterly
and unalterably opposed to the cus
tom of producers of moving picture
films of portraying our Protestant
ministers and places of worship in a
laughable, undignified way.
“And that we only ask justice and
fair play to all, but it is unfair to our
Protestant children to be intimidated
by a discrimination on religious sub
jects by the aforesaid.
“And, that we recognize the rights
of every person to worship as he may,
but we do not recognize the right of
the producers of moving picture films
to discriminate against the Protest
ant religion.
“And, that we pledge ourselves here
and now in a sense of justice to our
sacred oath and beliefs ,to wage a re
lentless war on this practice by re
ferring the matter to our state or
ganization with a request to nush this
matter through the national organ!

one-sided affair with motion picture
producers. Let the Klansmen fall in
behind and help boost for all-Ameri
can pictures and demand that Roman
propoganda be cut out, just as was
done recently in a western state.
There it was proposed to show ‘The
White Sister,” and the local picture
house asked the Klan to send a com
mittee to censor it. The committee
saw the picture and pronounced it
the most insidious piece of Catholic
propaganda that has yet been shown
in this country, and the manager cut
the picture and did not show it at all.
That was real co-operation.
Just a few nights ago radio listen
ers-in, and it is estimated that there
were over 6,000,000 of them, were
given a lecture on this same picture,
which is full of Roman propaganda,
now running in New York city. It’s
now come to a point where people
are asked to come and see this sort
of stuff running in picture houses
and the very air we breathe is being
used to exploit this kind of propa
ganda.
Let Klansmen heap their criticism
on every picture in which it is sought
to put this sort of stuff over and see
how quickly the producers will
change their tactics when they begin
to get the effect of the criticism and
loss of business at the box office.
The time is ripe for all good Prot

thing if they would put a stop to the
Roman practice. Now is the time to
strike, while the iron is hot.
New Play Libels
Protestant Ministry
(By s. A. P.)
A stock impresario who operates
in Washington and Baltimore, George
Marshall, is said to have offered
$6,000 for each city, for the rights
to produce the play called “Rain.”
The sale of a play in this fashion
would be something moderately new
in theatrical booking—the producers
of “Rain” would agree not to send
the play to either of those cities, and
Mr. Marshall would instead mount
the play for a run in each town.
Harris is said to be considering the
offer for two reasons: —First, he could
not expect to make that much if he
played the two cities himself; Sec
ond, the amount would be clear prof
it, as he could be playing elsewnere.
He thinks that “Rain” is unlikely
ever to exhaust its territory.
On the other hand he is said to
be hesitating on the ground that a
stock production of the play might
be so inferior to the original pro
duction that it would damage the
reputation of the play. There is talk
of Mr. Harris maxing a moving pic
ture of this play, in which event it
would be shown in every city, town
and village in the country.
This is the play In which a Protest
ant minister Is portrayed In the odi
ous role of a rapist When the Lord’s
Day Alliance requested a change
made or the discontinuance of the
play, the request was refused, and
the play was continued uninterrupt
edly, until it has just concluded Its
six hundredth performance.
When the self-respecting Protest
ants throughout the country felt it
to be their duty to boycott Charles
Chaplin’s play, ‘The Pilgrim,” surely
the play, “Rain,” and its Jewish own
er deserve even greater censure. It
would teach them a lesson that Prot
estant ministers must be given the
same respectful treatment that Cath
olic priests and Jewish rabbis receive.
Show them that they cannot insult
the people in the places where the
population is composed mainly of
Protestants, and expect the large
audiences that they can in towns like
New York city, with their plays in
which Protestant ministers are cast
in such disgraceful roles.
Let Protestants everywhere watch
for this play, and whenever and
wherever it is shown, boycott it out
of town, and out of existence, if it
is possible to do so.
Klansman, the keynote of life is
love--and see to it that you do not
lose the rest of the tune.

The supporters of Charles H.
Sloan for senator are emphatic in
their declaration that a material fac
tor in his overwhelming defeat at the
hands of Senator Norris was the Kn
Klux Klan. They claim to have poaf
t>ve proof that word was sent out to
the Klan members in the state just
before election day to vote solidly for
Norris as a ‘safe man.’
“It is not asserted that Sen. Nor
ris or anyone for him made any tie
up with the Klan, but that he was
picked because the mother of Mr.
Sloan was a Catholic and on the
ground that when he was a recent vis
iter in Rome he called with a number
of other tourists at the Vatican and
was given an audience with the Pope.
“Mr. Sloan heard of these stories
being afloat the night before elec
tion, word having been sent him from
various parts of the state, but he
could do nothing at the time.
That the Klan was active in the
primary election is indicuted by the
numerous instances of flaming cross
es that were mysteriously displayed
in cities and towns on the eve of the
voting.”
The power of the Klan is slowly
sinking in, and people are beginning
to sit up and take notice and realize
the truth. Watch for results in In

openly in support of one candidate
for governor over all others.
