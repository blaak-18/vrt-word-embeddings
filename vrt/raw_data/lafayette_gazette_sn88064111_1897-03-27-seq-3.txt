Baton Rouge Advocate:
Several years ago few public men
in America occupied a higher po-I
.sition or gave greater promise of a
brilliant career as a statesman than !
did Ex-Senator J. J. Ingalls ofb
Kansas. Possessed of many bril- "
ilant gifts, a finished oratoi, a
trained parliamenitarian and a rec
bgnized leader of his pa`ty it seemed a
for a time as though there was v
nothing that stood in the path otft
his attaining the very highest
honors within the gift of his party.
Indeed his election for one term as t
president pro tern of the Senate left t
but little fol him to desire in the
line of patty promotion and his po
sition was regarded as being as
cured. Unfortunately for his per- a
honal ambition, however, the eco- h
homic conditionis in Kansas were
such as to bring about a revolution
-4n the political sentiment of the
State and his career came to a sud- I
tlen and somewhat ignominious ter
inination. From presideit prod tern t
bf the Senate and one of the most
brilliant men of his age, to sporting ,
reporter of a daily newspaper is an t
experience which few men haVe
been privileged to enjoy, but such
has been the experience of Mr. In
galls, and to his credit be it said
that his efficiency in the latter ca- t
pacity has been as marked as teais
his career as a leader of men and a!
snoulder of thought in the palmiest
days of his senatorial career.
Although conceding the ability of
the brilliant Kansanr the Advocate h
has nevert beeli an admirer of his i
methods, although we must confess t
that his defense of his course in ac
t:epting the position of sporting re
borter on a metropolitan newspaper
is creditable alike to his judgment
and his manly independence. In
reply to his critics, Mr. Ingalls ob
served that when he was defeated in
his political aspirations he did ndt
loaf about Washington and harass
his friends with applications for I
Soft government jobs; he did not !
urge his past services as a reason I
vhy he should become a pensioner
hipon the government bou'fiy, but
he set to work to make his own liv
ing in a manner consistent with the
inaintenancze f hIs personal and
political independlence and his in
tlividual self - respect. Nor does
Mr. Ingalls go about whining about
the ingratitude of parties or the
short memories of his friends as so
many do who have experienced a !
Similar fate. On the contrary, he
has taken his defeat with complac
ence and in the in st philosophic
spirit that could b-: imagined, and
while others sulked in their tents he
took the field in the interest of his
party and put in effective work in
behalf of its candidate and plat
form. Now that the campaign is
over and his parly has once more
come into power the sturdy Kansan
scorns to waste his time  it pressing
his claims upon his party for office,
but betakes hiirnself to pursuits
more profitable frntr a pecuniary
Standpoint and which better corn'
port with his independence and
self-respect.

in a glass vial and thousands of American

while the police have been sedt for to iudhrd

"The Journal has just issued an extra
claiming to have first received and bulletined
this startling information and boasting its
tnterprisc as another triuniph of the 'new

Journal's extra appeared on the streets tile
World isnued a similar extra denouncing the
editor of the Journal as a liar add a horse
thief and claiming that it had the news ten
seconds before the Jourd.al, but jealous of
the 'new journalism' for strict veracity, it
held so important a matter of news until it
could investigate and discover whether it
Was false or true, and that thus through its
devotion to the veracity of 'new, journalism'
and not to the Joutlral's superlr enterprise
its bulletin was a few seconds behind.

Sheriff Broussard:
CRawr.rv, La., Blanc 1 rotheis,
Dear Friends-As I have learned
of your condition through the pa
pers I feel it risy duty as a child of
God to ask you how do you stand
with your God. Do you feel satis
fied that when you leave this world
you will be at rest ? If not, I beg
you in the name of Hirnt sho died
to save you from sin, to get ready
now. Jesus is at the right hand of
the Father, pleading for us and in
viting us to bie saved. It was your
honesty in your confe's!?cn of the
deed that imnpressed me most, and
Jesus says if we confess our sins he
is faithful and just to forgive our
sins and to clesnrre us from all un
righteousness. Andt as he forgave
t;te thie.es on the cross I ktdov) that
he can save you. And now, once
again, in the name of Jesus, I beg
you to go to him and confess your
sins and asi his forgiven'ess and be
lievc"c his promises and be saved.
This is the prayer of your humble
servant. AiMEN.
