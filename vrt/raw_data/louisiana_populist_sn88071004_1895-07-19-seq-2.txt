FRIDAY, JULY 19, 1$95.
Populists will please read and
preserve the plan of making nonu
nations, as it appears in this issue
since its ai endment by the last
meeting of our executive commnit
toe.
The amendment was slight, blut
many did not understand the plan
at first, and it would he well for
you to preserve this plan for a
guide on the clay of the primary.
We will print it in several issues
so that you may hand it around,
and thoroughly understand it.
If the old saw, "The hit dog
is the one that howls," is true, we
ertainly struck our young lx)liti
cian of the People's Demands a
dleadener two weeks ago, for his
last issue is a prolonged howl from
introductory to doxology.
Not being able to refute our
charges, nor to meet our arguments,
he confines himself to low-flung
personal abuse that must tire and
disgust his readers, if he has any.
We must decline to nauseate our
readers with such stuff, and would
advise the Demands to take a few
more lessons in respectable mud
slinging from Bro. Goodwyn and
Bro. Wells.
It is refreshing to hear a galoot
mouthing about "er dollah which
air good with or dollah in Yeorup."
when at the same time he can
not command a dollar of any
kind to keep the wolf away from
the door. The batter, which such
men have in the place of brain,
will sour some day, and then what
will become of the poor cuss -
"W. H. Harvey, more familiar
ly kown uas 'eoin,' is an openly
avowed populit, amd yet we find
people n MisIasippi who call
themselve democratze following his
eacbhingu." - Natches Democrat
To whieh the Chronicle tersely
adds, "Mr. Harvey also takes soup
with a spoom, but that is no reaso
why democras ihould.se a fork.",

A\n-e r' the a','ove ,l1Iry in the

Ihe Peopl'hs party second in the
Paste thii pred iction in youlr
hat, it will do to "l,-nk" on.
Now while this result wouhl not
ie a had thing for the Populists as
a part!y, annihilating, as it would,
the l)emoceratic party, and giving
ilthe Populists an assured victory in
I 966, we do think that the defeat
of silver and a continuance of the
gold stadarandard and contraction for
another four years would he a ca
I:lnty that few of the masses of
the lople are ablde to stand.
IIence in 19o,. when the Peo
ple's party would he the one great
party of the masses, and its logi
cal time of victory had come, the
people would no longer be capa
ble of conservative action, and we
fear the enld.
It does appear to us that the
free silver people could see that
political parties are linut vehicles
for the support of principle, and
that the principles are of such in
finitely greater importance than
the party, that the success of the
party is not to be considered as
against the success of the princi
ples.
The silver men should see that
it is only the gold men of the two
old parties, and the office seekers
of all the parties that are urg
ing party lines, and consequent di
vision of the silver forces in this
fight.
If the goldhugs succeed, by the
use of unlimited boodle, in draw
ing party lines on silver men and
keeping them divided in this fight,
as it now seems likely that they
will, then watch our prediction
made at the outset of this article.
Silver men should remember
that the gold standard is already
fastened upon this country, and
further silver coinage utterly pro
hibited, and that to continue this
miserable system it is not necessary
for goldbugs to waite in one party,
but only for them to keep tilver men
from waiting.
Look up the motives of the men
who are advocating party in pre
ference to principle.

After leaving New harlans I
nemade it aproahe int to ind out how the
most of the pasrnc rs stood16 on
the silver question. To my great
surprie wsI found most of the Miss
issippians and Alabamians in favor
of sound money, as they called it.
But after leaving Chattanooga I
never approached a single man that
was not an uncompromismng 16 to
1 silver man.
There was a crowd of New
Yorkers along, and they were
strong silver men and strong anti
Cleaveland men. They went fur
thor and said that they were going
to support the party that embraced
in its ilatform the strongest silver
plank that had any chance to win.
One gentleman told me that his
people had just now begun to read
and think for themselves, and with
out knowing how I stood political
ly, said that it would not surprise
him if Western New York ,ave
tho populists a majority. He,
himself, was from Buffalo, and has
always voted a Republican ticket.
But said that he could see no dhf
ferencee in the two old parties, ex
cept the offices, so he wanted to go
into a party that said something in
its platform, and meant something
when it said it.
In my next I will give you what
I think the two old( parties will do
in their next convention.

ganized for the purpose of system
atically propagating the doctrines.

the members. Written proxies,
held by memnlbers, shall be recog

The following, eing a part of
the relort of the (n'mmittee, was
read :
ENUNCIATION OF PRINCIPLES.
Believing that the raising of
government revenues by taxation
on the products of labor, or by
any other method than by direct
taxation on land values only, is
contrary to fundamental principles
of justice and inherent right ; and
recognizing the Natchitoch es Sin
gle Tax Club of Natchitoches, La.,
as ga n or ization having for its
sole object the support of such
principles of justice and right by
the propagation of the doctrine of
single tax on land values irrespec
tive of improvements as the only
legitimate source of public reve
nue; we hereby pledge our sup
port to said Natchitoches Single
Tax Club and consent to its gov
ernment acco)r(ling to the consti
tution regularly adopted by the
organization. Each of the under
signed hereby authorizes the Sec
retary of the Club to sign his
name to the roll of membership.
Then the organization was per
fected by the election of the fol
lowing officers: M. H. Carver,
president; Dr. Z. T. Gallien, vice
presidept; Simco W almsley, sec
retary and treasurer.
Propa~anda Committee: H. L.
Brian, Chairman; Julius Aaron,
A. E. Simon, Harry Percy, Sam
Levy.
Finance Committee: S. Nelken,
Chairman; P. F. L'herisson, Per
Beidre the above, the member
ship co mprises the following gen
tlemen : J. C. Trichel, J. A. Du
cournau Jr., Sam Aaron, Dr. E.
J. Harrison, W. G. Porter, Sol.
Nelken, L. J. Smith, J. T. John
son, Simeon Simon, P. S. Walms
ley, Richard Percy, Dr. J. Jamn,
N. T. Smith.
These 24 do not represent the
entire Single Tax strength here.
There are some 20 or 25 other
avowed Single Taxers who e ould
not attend the meeting, but will
join the Club at once. Then there
are many others who though not
avowed Single Taxers, are inter
ested in the question to the extent
of reading the works of Henry
George and other single tax htera
ture.

It is a common saying by the
learned and thoughtful of the old
world that the United States o
eminent is yet merely a trial. That
sdtable and solid governments are
not formed in a decde, nor even
in acentury, must be readily admit
ted. But what does the statement
mean. It means that after more
than one hundred years of trial
that it is not yet decided that the
people are competent to rule them
selves, and that we may yet have
to fall back on some of the forms
of monarchy.
It means again, that the forms
of government in all the past cen
of n,.iies -'it'v a trial. l'sit it en:

Iitics:tl I l lrtli than even th c' urtit -
IOlln ionltinarichy woul lie still bett

ductltion, that the logic of !(veriin
lnental conditions should force uI -
oil all als a conclusio(in, is jist what
the history of our go)vernment
lrliV.es, althoiti olur ovecrnmuent
ihas not lbeen a fair trial of the
Iroadest political libierty, for two
re'asons.
1st. For thirty c(enturihs the
governmenit of arthI have been
liasetl on the ildea that the l(oplel
were not competent for self go'
ernmnent, and the ha|bits of th liought
:s well as action cannot le throwntl
off in a llay, nor even in a (entllry.
2dlly. It is to the self intere't of
the few to control the many. It is
true that the very worst element in
our nattire, avarice, is at the I'ht
tomi of this desire to control, but
these two imotives put together and
acted tupon, have lprevented our
government from Ieing the best
specilen of the broadest political
freedom. It is unq uestionably
true that the trend in our political
affairs from the beginning has been
to enable the few to control the
many, miore and more easily. It
matters but little to those who
control, how they do it-wheth
er as bond slaves, serfs, peasants
or slaves to want, controlled by the
money power. The last has the
advantage of bringing the least
responsibility to the master, and
eqally as much profit, and is the
one universally adopted to-day.
Four and one-half millions of slaves
were freed at the close of the war,
and plans devised and pult in ope
ration then that have resulted in
bringing at least forty millions
more into just as abject a servitude
as were the bond slaves of the
South.
The war was only a contest as
thowho should be the master, and
that was the one great question
decidedl for this country by the
war, and has been acted upon (lay
by day since. This policy has the
advantage over any other, of be
ing worked in perfect harmony by
the few who are controlling the
world. It is this that makes me
politically mad. It is because our
political leaders for thirty years,
have joined and worked in harmo
ny with the one man power idea of
other nations, that I get warm tin
der the collar sometimes, and more
especially so, since those who are
practicing this diabolical method,
so enslaving to the masses, are
falselysailing under the glorious old
names of Democrat and Republi
can. Surely the masses of the
people of this country will be
aroused soon, and arise in thcir
might and break this tyranical
force-this centralizing trend that
is enslaving them slowly but
surely.
Let the masses ldetermine to give
a government of the people, by
the people, and for the people a
fair trial under conditions necessa
ry for the best results-the great
est liberty, not dominated by the
habits of thought and force of the
precedents of the centuries gone
by, as the selfish ,reed of sordid,
extortionate gain.

Editor PorULIT :
In my last communication I
spoke of the probability of an
over production, well, that pro
phecy is still good -for a crop
of grass and weeds. It rains, rains,
rains, rains! The outlook for both
corn and cotton is considerably be
low what it was one month ago.
The lower fodder is burned on the
corn, caused by too much rain.
Just what the yield will be remains
to be seen.
Well, the goldites are letting
loose some of their hoarded coin,
and thereby causing prices to ad
vance so as to fool the poor old
farmer again with their lying de
ceit. They will tell him now every
thing is getting lovely, and a big
suppliyof confidence is on the road
from nBritian, and just as soon as
the hooked nosed article arrives
we will have a big rise in prices ;
of course, we will not then need
the free coinage of silver, as that
would drive out all the confidence
in stook, thus we would be ruined
