People's Party Plat
form.
Full Text of the one Adopted
at St. Louis. P
The following is the platform and res
olutions adopted at St. Loui i by
the People's Party Convention. (;en. J.
B. Weaver being chairmau of the coin
mittee on resolutions:
The People's party assemnbled in na
tional convention. reaffirms its allegi- L
ance to the principles declared by the
founders of the republic, and also to the
fundamental principles of just govern
ment as enunciated in the platform of
the party in l$92. We ruc.ognize that
through the connivance of the present
and previous administrations the coun
try has reached a crisis in its national
ife predicted in our declaration four F
years ago. and patriotic action is the su
preme duty of the hour. We realize
that while we have political indepen- -
ence our financial and industrial inde
pendence is yet to he attained by res
toring to our country the constitutional T
I control and exercise of the functions
necessary to a people's government.
which functions have been basely nr- r
rendered by our public servants to cor
rapt monopolies. The influence of the
l Republican money changers has been -
more potent in shaping legislation than
the voice of the Am'racan people, ex
ecutive power and patronage have been i
used to corrupt our industries and
defeat the will of the people, and
plutocracy has been enthroned upon the (
ruins of Democracy. To restore the
government intended by the fathers and
for the welfare and prosperity of this (
and future generations, we demand the
establishment of an economical finan
c dial sy3tem which shall make us masters I
of our own affairs and independent of
European control, by the adoption of
I the following declaration of principles: t
FINANCE.
1. We demand a national money, d
safe and sound. Issued by the general b
government only, without the interven- b
tion of banks of lssue, to be a full legal
tender for debts, public and private, and a
a just, equitable and efficient means of t
distribution direct to the people and r
through the lawful disbursements of the f
government.
I. We demand the free and unre- 5
stricted colmage of silver and gold at
the present legal ratio of 16 to 1.- with- t
out waiting for the consent of foreign c
nations.
3. We demand the volume of eireu- I
I lating medium he speedily Inreased to
an amount sufficient to meet the de
mands of the htelness population ofli
this country ant to restore the just level 1
of prices of labor and productonl,.
4. We denounce the sale of bond,
and the, incre.+ae of the public interest c
Sbearing bondedhdebt made by the present
administration, as uannecesKsary and wit'- I
out authority of law. and demand that I
no more bonds be issued except by a t
Sspecifie act of congress. t
S . We demand such legal legisltaton
as will prevent the dem,onetisation of
I the lawful money of the United 8tates
SVy private contract.
8. We demand that the government
in payment of Its obligations shall use
It eption as to the kind of lawful mon
ey in which they are to be paid, and we
t 4oasee the present and proceeding
administrations for surrendering this
ntion to the holders of government ob
. We demand the graduated lucerne
tax. to the end that agregated wealth
shall bear its just propwt'on of taxation, I
and we denounce the decision of the
saprese court, in relation to the income
Stax law, as a misinterpretation of the
eoustitutlea and an invasion of the
rl ers of congress over the
--bc t of axation. I
. We demand that postal savings
tanks be established by the government
for the sale deposit of the people and
to fellitate exchange.

rI LAND.
1. The trite policy demands that na
tional anti state legislation shall he such
as will ultirateily enable every provi
dent and industrious citrten to secure a
Il home, and therefore the Ian I should not
t- be monopolized for speculative purpose-.
I1 All lands being held by railw.iys and
I other corporations in excess of their a,'
If tual needs, should by lawful mnanq be
d reelalmed by the government and heldt
a for actual settlers only, anti private land
monopoly as well as alien ownership
r- should he prohibited.
l S. We condemn the frauds by which
- the land grants to the Pacifle railway
n comp anies have thorough the connivance
of the interior department robbed mnl
. tit:.iles of eI:qal boaa tidesetler-s of their
a homes and aminers: of their claims, and
we d e.anil le,,islathon by congress which
if will inforee the exemnption of mineral
SI lands fron such grcnts after as well as
before patent.
l 3. We demneal that bons fide settlers
i on all public lands Ie granted free
i homes, as providel in tha national
a- homestead law, ani tl:ht no exemption
i be, male in ta: eae of In liatn reserva
a tions when op mne I for settlement, and
that all landemot now patmel coats mn
