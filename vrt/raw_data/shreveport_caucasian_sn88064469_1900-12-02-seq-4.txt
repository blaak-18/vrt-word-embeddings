The prcspects for the passage of the
Yicaragua canal bill at the coming
csaeiou of Congrees is encouraginig:
The D)emocrats anu the R~publicris
are conmmitted in their party plat

however, is beiag opposed by traie
xontinuntai railway interests.
Senator Morgan, of Alabama, wbo
has been for years an enthuesias ic
and an earnest advocate of the c'a
sitruc ion of the Nicaragua canal is
confident the bill will receive speedy
and favorable consideration, but the
greatest majority of the citizens of
the United States want a renal which
will be owned and controlled by thn
United States. The American peu
people will not favor a canal in which
'urop an nations will have jciut

THE SLOT MACHIINB.

feeling of disgust ahbe proposal to
rwive slot machine gambling In New
" Orleans, when ppblc sentiment has
0o emphatically condemned it, and its
evile have been so clearly demon
atratrd "
It would seem that the plea for the
revival of this moat demora!Ising
devise of gambling is "business nec
essty." Well, It esuch a plea were
iLdorsed, there would he no limit to
the -bustness neessity," and in the
at irit of "buslnees necessity" all laws
bwhich ara intended to regulate and
suppress crimes would be set snde
or ignored, but, it is safe to assume
that the ordinance peading in the
city council of New Orleans will be
detested.,
And ao it list: astit-"What is

CHINSS.
The Picayune in commenting on
the ordina' ce, pending in the co incil
of the ci y of N:w O 'eans in favor
of the slot machiue says: The slot
rmasebiue is a bembltng device, aLd
for saveral years it was allowed ito be
operated in various places of busi.
niss in this city, until it became a
cry.ug evil. It ouf'-red sp cial op.
portunities to ytuthe, and even to
small boys, to gamble away their
utnickelse, and the result was a popular
uprising against the machines that
drove thmru out of the city under he
force or en ordinanuce ot the council.
*******
The pretext that the slot machints
which it is sought to authoriz: by
law will only be used to promote
tr.de, and not for gambliug purposes,
is a most Empty one, beesuae a ma
chine that permits the winning or
losing of drinks, cigars and oth r
merchanise, can -to used to win or
lose money, and, once set up tinder
the sanction of law, it will be freely
employed for such purposes.
* S * * . *
The very worst sori of gambling is
that which tempts and gives special
copportunities to youths of tender
age to risk money and to acquire
a thirst for sucu a vice, and that is
what the slot machines were d ing
woen they aroused puhlic indigna
tion which was stron enough to
drive them out of the city. To rn
tarn them under the protection of
law is to set up just so many agencits
to educate recruits for keno saops
a id faro banks. It would operate to
d moraliss the boys of tender years,
Shich would be a most shiamelf
crime.
The Industrial convention which
