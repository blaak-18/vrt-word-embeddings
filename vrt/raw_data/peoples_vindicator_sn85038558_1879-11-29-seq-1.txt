Our Senators, OUNNINGHAM and
MAIRSTON.
Now, here's the District Judge, a
lawyer of old,
Whose beasing is dignified, whose
speech is always bold,
Who has met the enemy, in many a
fierce battle,
And knows the cannon's mase, and
the muskets' rattle,
And that's, DAVID PIERSON.
Here comes one.Scarborough, whose
other name is Dan,
A youth from the pine hills, a mueh

He's a lawyer too, well versed in Its
lore.
And we will support him, nor run his
boat ashore.
The Distriot Attorney, D.C. SCAR

That's, SAMUEL P. RAINS.

COLORED VOTERS !
When a Greenbacker hands you a
copy of the Colfax Chronicle, dated
Nov. 15, 179, containing the platform
of their party; if you want to see
him squirm, just ask him to show
you an article on the 3d page of that
paper, entitled: "A REPUBLICAN
TALK," copied from the Jackson,
Mississippi, Comet. There you will
find wholesome advice. They dare
not show you that side of the paper.
A people, however exacting, ean.
not in justice expect the candidates
of our party to do all thework in
the canvass. An election has anoth
er sigolfication besides the success
of particular lndlviduals-there Is a
principle involved and around this
sentiment all men with patriotic
ideas will gather and do battle. Let
the leading citizens 'in every ward
take it upon themselves to fortify
the works in their own neighbor
hoods and the enemy will be repuls
ed. Would to God thatwe could in.
fuse into every breast the same
warm sentiments of love to country
and devotion to prinlcple that warms
our heart. Would to God that we
could depict in proper colors the
base ignonomy that would fall upon
a people who would be too craven to
demand their rights and too coward.

People of Natchitoehes your future
destinies are In your own keepnlag.
If you allow iadical combinations
to lull you into inaction yours will be
the fate of the craven, but if you
imitate the noble teacher of the
Bible, who standing upright In the
door of the Temple of God with u-n
sheathed sword, bade the infidel to
come no further, then yours will be
the proud record of a proud people.
Democrats of Natchitochbe your
duty is plain. We scarcely need
urge you to work In the interest of
your grand old party, for this you
have been accustomed to do. We
need not remind you of the faot
that defeat of your party and its
nominees would signifyanother lease
of corrupt government and the re
mission of your rights into alien
hands. Your Interests are many,
your duty very plain. As courage
ous men you must face the issues
that present themselves and where
and when difculties arise you must
bravely surmount them. The noe
ord of your party In the past is a
glorious one, and by all means keep
your political tenents high above
the foul touch of the Radical com
bination. The Democratic ticket
must be elected by an overwhelming
majority,.and todo so all hands must
be on deok.
