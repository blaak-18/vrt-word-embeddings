Will Not Abide by the Primanry
Election.
COL-.IIIIA, S. C., August 27.
A senlsatilon was created in this
State to-day by the ainoUnlilenUtt
that Seniiator Butler would not
abide iby the result o the prima
ry election which takes place to
morrow. Senatoll r Bitler in a tele
grani to the Collumbus Register
says: .1I beg to say' iii withdraw
ing the papier filed by me with Torni
kins, secretary of the enmocratic
executive coimmiittee, anouillluclliniig
liy candidacy. I iini following the
footsteps of distinguished reform
ers who are unwilling to submit
their claimis to .: primiary in which
everything has ueen cut, dried,
[packed salteds down by the
ring, when the result is stated and
known by the ring belore a vote
has been put in toe ballot-box."
Shreveport Times, (l)etn.)
Cleveland begged fotr the repeal
of "'thie silver ponrchasing law, to
stop our gold fr4om going to Eu
rope." le: got the repeal all right
but ask Carlisle about the stopper.
-Inter Ocean, (eIep.)
It was Abraham Lincoln that
said of the hankers of this conutry
that were wedded to the gold basis
the.ry: "I think every one of'
them ought to have his devilish
head shot oft."-The Issue.
Gov. Waite, of Colorado, has
been arrested lfor opening a letter
bielonging to another person. He
empIlhatically dlenies the charge.
When arrested lie refused to give
bond, which was fixed at $3.000 for
his appearance, and the commis
sioner released him on his own perC
soonal recognizance in the sum of
$100.
The people can and will control
monopolies and corporations if they
are allowed the free and untramel
ed right to vote anti have their
votes properly and honestly coun
ted. The ballot-box is the place
for the workingmen to get their
rightL, but in Louisiana it calls for
courage to conquer fraud.-Theoda
Independent.
Whenever a committee is ap
pointed to "investigate," you may
be sure there is somenthinug that needs
covering up, and will get to the
public if it is not covered up.

If the people of Louisiana are
ever given the opplortunity to vote
upon the question there would be
an overwhelming mntjority in favor
of such an election law as has been
generally d(lemanded by the press,

Legislature. - Crowley Signal,

The Democrats in congress are
deserving of the severest censure
for not fulfilling the promises made
to the people, and in due time, will
receive the punishment due to
treason to party and country. We

treachery. - Cincinnati Enquirer,

nearly 3,000 voters who have never
