BEAUMONT'S LATENT OUSHEL.
to the west, northwest, north, north
east and east. demonstrating that the
field, or pool, did not extend in those
directions, and in the territory to the
south alone remained the hope that the
field would be still further enlarged by
the opening of future wells in that di
rection. At that time it had thus been
shown that if the territory to the south
proved to be as dry as the territory on
the other three sid.a of the 150 acre
tract the field would be a more pool of
limited area, and yet, despite the fact
that 1.EM00.MN) barrels of oil had already
been taken from the 150 acre tract, the
Heywoodl No 3. the thirteenth well
drilled. seemeed to be as great a gusher,
seemed to is' capable of producing as
much oil as the first gusher, the Lucas
well. which conservative men say was
good for 50,000 barrels of crude petro
leum per day when it was first struck.
Pools ordinarily open up for business
In a sensational way by producing vast
quantities of oil at the start and then
speedily dwindle to insignificance. They
go up like the rocket and come down
like the rocke's stick. Yet here is air
parently a pool of a very few rcr"9s
whose 13 curbtied volcanoes of oil lrave
alreidy produced I,EtM),(WI) harri-is. amid
the last well comes in as strong rr. the
first. Old oil men cannot understand
this, and there are niany other things
about the Beaumont feld that puzzle
them. There seems 9o ire ptrtically
no gas worth mentioning, and yet the
wells all flow with wonderful strength
and do not need the usual jolt given by
the explosion of several hundred quarts
of ultroglycerin in the oil bearing sand
or rock. When the stream of oil in the
Heywood N'o. 2 broke loose, it shot up
213 feet in the air, forming a fountain
of oil that was a very beautiful but ex
pensive luxury, and yet when this well
was shut off It only had a pressure of
80 pounds to the square inch at the
casing bead. The oil is unlike any oth
er ever discovered in this country; the
wells are ,drilled in a new way because
quicksands prevent the use of the old
apparatus. The new method mixes up
the rock and sand so that no one can
tell exactly how and when and where
different formations are encountered,
and the conditions and indications are
so different that tie veterans are all
unable to tell what the outcome will ie.
The consequence is that no one knows
anything as yet concerning the true cal
iber of Beaumont. There has been a
great deal written in the newspapers
about gushers that produce 40I0(1 or
50,000 or even 100.tX) barrels of oil Iwr
day, though 50.000 is said to be the true
figure for the Lucas well, but no man
can tell how long the gushers will gush
-whether they will continue to pour
forth seas of oil week after week and
month after month or practically run
dry in a few days or a fortnight. It
must be borne in mind that owing to
the lack of tankage not one of these 13
producing wells has yet been unbridled
and permitted to show what it can do.
It is one thing to have a 50,000 barrel
well in good working order and anothier
to care for such an enormous produc
tion.
The oil must be stored somewhere,
and the favorite receptacles for this
purpose-huge iron tanks, each with a
sapacity of 35,000 barrels-are very
expensive structures and cannot he
built in a week or a month in a new
oil country. Some of the tanks even
hold 50,000 barrels, and supposing t at
Coffey & Galey, the owners of the T.n
cas well, were able to perform the tm
possible and create a new tank each
day this vast, constantly growing
tskage sebeme would only be capable
