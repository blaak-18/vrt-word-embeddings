OUII WASHINGTON LETTER.
WASHiGTroN D. C., May, 18; 1878.
The Republicans will make, are
making, a mistake In attempting to
conduct the comming camnpaign in
the States on a strictly Aiti-Sprtlh
ern basis. Even while the whotecoun
try was comparatively prosperous, in
18G8 and 1872, there was not enough
in the sectional question to make the
election of a President certain, so, he
sides that the popularity of a success
ful soldier was sought and his strer gth
given to the ticket. In 1L76, if the
Republican platform meant the bloody
shirt and proscription of soutlhern
men and interests because they were
Southern, the meaning was carefully
concealed, but nevertheless the blppdy
dy shirt was waved and toe ituBlt
was defeat. Of the white vote of the
country Mr. Tilden recieved three
quarters of a million more than Mr.
Hayes. But for the wavering Ger
mans and civil service retormers
brought in by Schuz, Evarts, and the
others, that majority would have been
much larger, and Ohio and other States
would have given their votes for
Tilden.
In the face of these facts, even if no
question outside of those concerning
the South had acquired importance
in the minds of the people, it would
be folly to rely upon these alone
for success. But in many States
North and East, the currency ques
tion had assured new fofm* and ac
quired a new sigonificance, hiod Vill
tender appeals to sectional feeling
ineffectual even among the "stalwart"
Republicans of New England.
When the Government has 'resnm
ed specie payments" we shall still
have substantially the same dilficul
ties to contend with as now. A con
dition of affairs which enables us to
pay in gold to-day may not exist to
morrow. If it exist to-morrow it may
not in aweek.
The investigation of the electoral
fraud in Florida and perhaps in Lou
siana and South Carolina has been
determined on and Mr. Hayes will
soon stand before the 'coptry and
world in his true character.
With no intention of- detracting
from the services of any other repre
sentative in Congress of the Southern
people, it may be said of Senator Gor
don that none had a greater influence
in forcing the concession made to
that section than he. From the day
he first took his seat in the upper
House it has been felt and acknowl
edged in every direction, while never
yielding his convictions of right to
"expediency" his clear, statesmenlike
way of stating them always tends to
allay sectional opposition and quite
petty jealousies; and while the inter
est of Georgia always has the prefer
ance, his views are sufficiently broad
to take in and correctly estimate
those pertaining to every other sec
tion. The number and characterof the
audience that listened to his speech
last Tuesday attest the almost uni
versal interest felt in his utterance and
the weight attached to them. Of the
many able speeches on the all-absorb
ing topic of finance this session, it is
doubtful if any have called out so
large a house, certainly beta amre in
telligent one; and if the rounds of ap
plause that greeted him again and
again corectly interpreted the santi
ments he aroused and created, it must
be accorded the place-of a masterpiece.
It will be sought god ipad in full by
many with whomp Bi3-t~iing relating
to financial matters are ordinarily
very dry reading, and I refer all to
the Record, conte tiq. e with
just saying that he arraigned bur fi
nancial legislation of the last 10 years
as the source of all our present woes.
He denonced contractioni.as. the'im
mediate and remote cause of all the
commercial distries and all the enf
fering and demoralization of to-day,
and he fortified and xinade his posi
tion doubly impregnable by copious
citations from our own and foreign
history.
The Post, Democratic daily here,
said of it: "Gen; a0 09l4 bpeech
was the feature of tre ptbbeddings.
The galleries were filled with ladies
and gentlemen in anoticipatioan of
something brilliant and they were
not disappointed. Gen. Gordon sur
passed all his former eforts. Hepic
tared in words of eloquence the evils
that have followed vicious financial
legislation, and pointed out the way
to escape the fatal -consequences of
this legislation. As s'oon as he ceased
speaking the crowded.glleries were
emptied, showing what had brought
the people out. ALBIOIN.
VAN DORN AND FORREST.,
BY OGN. D. H. MAURY, OF RICHaO'vD, vA.
I Detroit Free Prepse.i ?
In the spring of 1863 Forrqst was in
Middle Tennessee, commandtngribrigade
in the cavalry corps of Van Dorn. By
one of his bold and ajcillful movements
he captured a Federal brigade comman
ded by Gen. Coburn, and duly rejrorted
th. capture of the men, hores, arms and
equipments to Gen. Bmrgg, 'ho or~t~red
that all the captured projperty siounld b
turned into the proper ofiers .of. tbiear-,
my. But Forrest's men had tMd in the
principle that the Spoils bloui to the
victor, And Gen. Braggtw 4bpl offiiers
received but few contrt, tione om For
rest's fortunate operations ah4 Van Dotn
was instructed to call him to acdount and
enforce obedience to the ordy oftP(g a.
commanding the army.
Accordingly Van Dorn sent for Forrest
and sternly asked hign1 wJiy~hetwrl not
turnedin the arms, etc., captinred with
Cobnro's Brigade. , d ,
Forrest ~eplied. "1~eo~spqo.Ihv.'bgo
'em."
"Then," said Van Dbra, " rpreseft
statement is at variqas yo tw

Forrest replied: "Gen. Van Dorn, I am
not in the habit o& being spoken to in
that way, au &Wbon itadadeen

"oen. Forrest, my 1i&iTtiSkll never

ITEMS.
The receipts of grain at New Or
leans is on the rapid increase, being
Ilarger now than at any time since
1865.
The milling industry of this coun
try is said to rank next to that of iron.
'The number of wills is over 25,001),
affording employment to over 60,000
men, whose annual wages are about
200oo00000; and turning out yearly
hboit 56,0,000) barrels of tilouhr, of
which 4,000,000 are exported to for
eign countries.
Favorable reports come to us from
the interior regarding tihe condition
of young cotton and corn. In some
districts cotton growth has been
slightly checked by cool nights, but
on the whole it is in good order. In
the valleys the young cotton plant is
undergoing the. acraping process,
while stands are reported to average
well and to be unusually good in sec
tions. The prospect is all that can
be wished. The area in cultivation is
fully as large as last year.
The WAshington correspondent of
a Philadelphia paper says that inter
est on United States bonds is now
frequently paid in green backs, and
adds that one holder recently took
8100,00)0 in paper money in prefer
ence to gold. Considering that govern
ment depreciates its own paper, by
refusing to accept it in payment of
duties, this statement of preference
of greenbacks to gold is in proof that
government paper money is not only
as goodl, but better than gold for all
dlomestic purposes.
The wheat crop has been damaged
by rain, fly and rust, especially in
West and Middle Tennessee. The
tgent of the injury in some locali
tifs is said to be as much as 50 per
cent though on the whole it will not
amount to that. In Illinois and Mis
souri there has been damage from the
same causes, as also in Alabama and
some parts of Georgia. Throughout
the Nriwes4,;4lid -as far .north as
tfie;ritilih lM)qiýssions, t i farmers
ar b ubglastto their ·elds, which
jh l ktd n ltypng wheat,
sg1orobs d 'lty, and nearly
a month in advance of last year, and
promising 25 or 30 per cent greater
yield. Other crops are in equally
good order.
The Supreme Court of Massachu
setts has decided that a note given
for a church gubscription does not
carry with it an obligation to pay,
since it is given without considera
tion.
SA Chicago man says that he is go
ing to put 1000 hives of bees on barges
drawn by a tug, starting from Lou
isiana northward on the Mississippi,
halting every fifty miles to allow the
bees to feed, arriving at the clover
fields of Minnesota in July.
Texas estimates an increase of 15 per
cent in her wheat crop over last year.
The acreage last year was about 400,000;
this year it will be about 450,000, which,
at an average yield of thirteen buahels
per acre, will produce a crop of 5,000,
000 bushels. This is insuflcient for the
home consumption of that state, and the
probbhlity is that the inrease oif produc
tion will not keep pace with additional
requirements$,or 6nly the table lands are
profitable for wheat culture, cotton pay
ing better in the low lands, while timber
lands consume more than they produce.
