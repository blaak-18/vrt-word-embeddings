again at night-when returning from
work. Then they went shopping to

lefThey wished to make his scquaintl

such a house, wher. the tenants live
with open doors. But Tony had a very
reserved manner, and bowed so distant
ly and coldly-although politely-to
his nein athbors when he met them on the
stairs that they were afraid to ap
prach him.
"selves upo, ladies," said the doorkeeper,
who was inclinedn to be suntimental,

Certainly Tony had been very de
voted to his wife and bould not be con
soled now that he had lost her--but he
was not a widower.
His life had been simple, but not by
any means happy. Although politelyon

until he was thirty he had not suceed

wife . who had known want as he had.

such trifles. Tony lost his head over a

with a glass door, in which his wife
could admire herself the whole day.
They were married and nt first lived
very happild. They had two modest
rooms on the fifth a sensioorof a, house on
the bolevard de Port Roytself with a
little balcony from which they had a

At last a son was born and was put

him once a fortnight. But at the end
of a year the child died of convulsiona.

little Ad'rienzcxttely. lnut his father,
having detected a scrap of paper pinned
to one Qf the toys, opened it and read:
"For Adrian. from his brother Felix,

Suddenly he.found the boy pressing
against him and murmuring: "Mamma."
There, only a few paces away, under a
clump of cypress trees, knelt the
mother. She was clad in a wretched
dress and a thin shawL Her eyes were
sunken, and her cheeks hollow and
pale. She was looking at her husband,

When they reached the room Tony
made his wife sit down in the only arm

opened a dr awer from which he took an
old cardboard box. Out of this he took
the wedding ring, which he pressed on
his wife's finger. Then, without a

English Weather.
I never saw a whole day in London
that could honestly be described as
"fine," let alone the hyperboles. One
may speak of a "'fine" five minutes, a
fine half hour, or an hour. Nothing
beyond that, so far as I could see. It is
a settled point among scientists that
with his naked eyes no man can gaze
at the noonday sun. I am prepared to
confound these learned theorists. On
the 1st of August, 1680, about one p.
m., I gazed at the London sun from
the top of an omnibus standing near
Hyde Park corner. I take my oath on
it that, to the best of my knowledge
and belief. I did gaze at the sun, did
stare at him boldly, did, in fact. out.
stare him and make him retire behind
the gathering clouds. This is a his
torical fact, and I record it, therefore,
with all the pomp and circumstance
befitting it. I give date, place and
hour, which is more than most of our
modern scientists do in announeingr
thei. discoveries of mares' nests.--The

She Knows a Lot.
The really popular girl always knows
a lot. She knows enough not to gossip
about a people who have done her fa

favors. She knows enough to dress ap
propriately at all times and never to be
overdressed. She knows enough not
to wear diamonds, discuss religion or

eage or tell long-winded tales. She
knows enough to keep silence and she
knows enough to talk well. She knows
how to danoe, swim, row, sail a boat,
play the piano and banjo, sing negro
melodies and College songs. She knows
enough not to "give away" all the fun
ny confidences that the boys give her
when in the blues or feeling particular
ly good, and she knows how much to
cook when they are stranded on an
island, becalmed and without oars or a
stick with which to pole home. She
knows just how to catch a fish and
then to cook it, and she knows enough
not to growl and- whine and semplain

the prom f the United iltes to

fideneo in the ability of the Uni*e
States government to do so.
To test the thing further, I went to
another store and beoaght another
thirty tpounds for a dollar on credit.
I will admit there was some risk there,
but then the merchant knew I had.a
fine lot of razor-backs feeding on my
pinders, and whenever they were fat
enough to market they. wOuld bring
the gold, silver or paper. Now, where
in did one .have. any more purchasing
power than another? It was all con
fidence.
I will now relate an incident-which;
if there were more, there would be less
cry about-bard times. ..
Idon't raise all the pOrk I. feed, but
depend upon- buying a great deal.
Well. you know, doubtless, that money
has been very scarce and. hard to get,
and there has been such a want of con
fldence between man and man that it
has also been difficult to buy anything
on credit.
I learned of a man who had a nice lot
of hogs to sell, and I went to see them,
and I agreed with him on a price, and
would take them on a certain day, pro
vided I could get the money. Not
being able to turn anything I wished
to dispose of into cash or to collect it,
I went to institutions and persons
whom I knew to have plenty of hoard
ed cash. The very best security that
could be offered failed to get a dollar.
I very regretfully went to my neigh
bor and told him I Iwould have to de
cline ta.ing his hogs as I could not
get the money to pay him.
"Now look here, major," says he,
"you have got more pinders than you
have hogs to eat them. I have more
hogs than I have -pinders to feed. If I
turn these hogs out they will stray off
and I will lose some if not all, and they
will do me ho good, and if you get no,
hogs you will lose your pinders. Now
you just give me your note payable at
Christmas and take these hogs along
and turn them on your pinders, .and
you will get your money out of them'
in time to pay me."
There was a stroke of financiering.
and one that is creating wealth, for I
can take that lot 'of hogs which I have
been feeding for the last six weeks and
turn them into cash any day for
enough to pay for them and have a fine
profit left.
A refusal to let me have the hogs
would not only have been a loss to
both of us, but to the community at
large, for when these hogs are sold the
money will be kept at home instead of
going off to Chicago to pay for that
which we can make at home.
Now, Mr. Editor, in times like the
present, who is the financier, the in
dividual or the baihk officers who hoard
the money, or this piney woods farmer
who had forethought enough to use
that which he had so as to create
money, restore confidence and revive
trade? "
And it has. been just this kind of
financiering that has made a man of
easy circumstances out of one wvho,
wlhen he came here from South Caro
lina a few years ago, had so little of
this world's goods that he was com
peled to buy what many would call
about as poor pine land as there is in
Florida, and that on credit. But then
he says "the land is not poor," for as
he says "as big pine trees as grow
about here don't grow on poor land,"
and I reckon he is right, for he has
never bought one dollar's worth of
commercial fertilizer yet.
But he has improved his land, built
him a comfortable one-and-a-half story
house, has lots of children, fruit trees,
bees, poultry, razorbacks and cattle
and is out of debt.
His sweet potato beds are a sight. I
never before saw rows bursting with
great big tubers peeping out all along.
He says the secret of his success is
in thoroughly preparing his land and
working his crops and not laying any
thing by with a spear of grass in it,
that deep ploughing even in pine land
and thorough cultivation and elbow
grease tell the tale.
And still there is a great cry about
"not making a living in Florida" farm

COTTON SEED FOR COWS.
Isetlits -oe Feeding Tests Coaducted at the
Tennessee Experiment Station.
Some conclusions, which the results
of feeding tests conducted at the Ten
nessee station during two winters ap
pear to justify, are thus stated in a bul
letin issued fromnthe stationbi
We are convinced that, properly used,
cotton-seed hulls from sound seed and
free of extraneous matter are a valua
ble addition to our list of feed stuffs for
milch cows. We can recommend as
giving satisfactory results the use of as
much as 15 pounds of cotton-seed hulls
in the daily ration per 1,000 poundalive
weight. A larger proportion has with
our cows caused a weakening of the
digestive powers, evidenced in some
cases by a tendency to diarrhmea, in
others to constipation.
Cotton-seed meal is the most valua
ble of all the so-called waste products
used as feed stuffs. It can be safely
fed for long periods, as much as flve
pounds per day per 1,000 poundslive
weight in the ration for cows giving
milk. As the cow approaches the time
for calving the proportion of cotton
seed meal should not exceed 'three
pounds daily. . We do not think it ad
visable tdeed more than five Donds
of cotton-seed meal daily to milch
cows. For butter making it is not ad
visable to exceed three pounds daily.
Many years of alose observation else
where, as well as the results of recent
experiments, induced the writer to be
lieve that it is not safe to feed eotton
seed meal as the sole addition to the
daily allowance of coakre foddeis, par-*

Prof. Waite, of the department of
agriculture, has recently given much
attention to the subject of intermin
gling fruit trees in orehards. He tells
of a pear orchard in Virginia of Bart
lets mixed with other sorts which has
become famous for bearing. A stock
sompany was led by the success of this
oreed meald to plant 0,000 Bartetts on
similar soil near by. In one corner of
the great orchard stood a tree of
Clapps' Favorite, Around this tree
the Bartlett bore finue crops. Along
o f pe the orchard also stood now
and then a tree of another sort.
Along this side the influence of
cross fertilization has also been
noted. Prof. e Vaite covered a
large number of blorhard oms of the Bart

The stomach is the rei.
If it fails, everything tihis. The
liver, the kidneys, the Itings,:the
heart, the head, the blood, thenarves
all go wrong. If you feel wrong,
look to the stomach first. Put that
right at once by using August
Flower. It assures a good appetite
and a good digestion. -
