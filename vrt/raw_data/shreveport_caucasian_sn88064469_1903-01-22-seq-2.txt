TRIFLES OF FASHION.
Little Novelties of Drec. Which Are
Worth ('onslderlng.
(Special Correspondence.
New York. 1 ,e(. 2!).- So much depends
upon the trifles which belong to our
outfits it would be doing it wrong to
those who make and invent thetm if we
left them out of our consideration-slip
pers. for instance. gloves. shi. buckles,
little but dainty ornaltents for tlte hair,
fancy stocks, sashes, pretty dressing
Sacks and. In fact, so many u things that
onet grows afraid as the list stretches
out indefltnitE ly.
5ome1 o the l dressinlg sacks atid tea
jackets are simply e'xq~iiisite, being
made of the ftinest and softest of silks
or crlpe de chine and snllt heled in lace
and further decornIted with ribbons
pineeld in every Inim:Ainblie mnunlner. On
one dainty tea jacket I saw bunlches of
soN STTYLISH BRAIDS.
baby ribbon set along in the hollows of
the scallops of lace ruffles, the loops be
ing of irregular length and of several
shades of violet. From dark heliotrope
to the faintest lilac they went. This,
with the creamy lace and the ivory of
the crape, made a "beautiful color
scheme.
Many of the tea jackets have narrow
black velvet ribbon as a finish. Nearly
all have no collar, though a few have a
high stock. One tiling they all have in
common, and that is that they are all
ruffled with lace, sometimes plain, but
most often the rulfles are set on in van
dykes, or scallops, which give them a
very dressy appearance. These Jackets
are worn w!th handsime but'generally
dark skirts, the jacket being so very
ornamental that a skirt very much
trimmed 'would be out of place.
With this kind of gown the fancy
slipper Is a necessity, sad some of them
are so very pretty that weweleome any
movement that ej}poses tee. High heels
prevail and big vamtp.`1 or are they
Cailed tonguen BRut, whatever they are
eatled& they are lartge ad are rielely oe
namented with -whatever is empIeeld
to., wake th. rest beautiful. For In
stance, if oue Is embroidered id gold
thread the ramp is clone. t the same
style. :eading is put on others, 'nd
these are of steel ;or gilt, sometimes of
pearls and again of coral or tulquoiles.
Diamiond ornaments are often seen; not
imitation ones, but real ones. These
are generally in the form of buckles
and perhpsa buttertly or a flower or
some hera.ii device. Everything goes.
Large bows.. ribbon are set on, the in
step of some, and others have large ro
settee of lace, with some fancy orna
mnent in the center.
To match these one must have em
broidered steekings done in the same
colok and general style. Stockings aft
dot always embroldered, or made with
openwork insets, for some -and*thee
are of t~e' most delicate of the light
coloen-are quite plain, with not even
a silk clock.- But others have trailing
vines from .the middle of the fnstep
and reaching up about half way. These
are doae in colorel silks.and some
times. wth uetal along in them. The
rococo desigrs are in most favor. The
pilacipial object of the designs seems
to he to give an extreme slenderness
to the ankle. The shoes are of kid,
slik and satin.
Stocks are made high, and nearly
all have lttle tabs in front which af
told a place for pretty lace bordering.
The ftnudation for these is silk umtll
on a fi-atherboe tform, and this i~ then
