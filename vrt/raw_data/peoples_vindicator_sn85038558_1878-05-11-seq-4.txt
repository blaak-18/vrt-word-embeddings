OUR WASHINGTON LEITTER.
WASHINGTON D. C., Mayl, 4 1878.
If the Republican Senatorial ene
mies of Hayes received a blow in the
publication of that noted "interview"'
itvh Conkli og, Hayes has correspon
ding damage from thie confessions iejust
made by those men who stole the
State of Florida for him. The sub- I
stance of thie statement of Mr. Lin, I
member of thre Florida Board of Can
vassers, or Retorniig Hont d, is that
lie has boll-dozed by friellnds of Haves
into committing acts, llmaterial to lire
publican success, which hie knew to be
wrong. The man belioeves hiunself to
be dying, and his st:etieent may he
taken as a death-ledl confession. The
one now published was made soime
week's ago, and is general, though
conclusive as to thie stealing of thie
State. The fuller and more tdetailed
one will be publishedi soon. The
statement of Capt. Dennis, who con
trolled the county in which the great
or frands in voting were com mitted,
is Conclusivie also, aniidl, tikeni with
McLin's confession, showed beIyoind
any question that thoe State shoulh
have been gi ven to Tilden by at least
Sir huidrieied mijurity.
If these were charges of disappoin
ted Democrats there might be a show
of propriety in a refusal by Congress I
to take action ; or, if thie Electoral
Comniission hill had not provided in
general terms that the candidates for I
the Presidencv should hali;ve a resort
to the courts, there might lhe a kind l
of p1op0iety' in treating Ille lecision of
that Comimission as a iinality. Bit 1'
here we have thie confessions of those I
Replublieans who stole thie State of
Florida and diis defeated Tilden, and c
we have an implied promise of Con- o
gress that the courts shall be open to 4
that genItleman. Now let Congress I t
open thie courts. If the bill now he- C
fore thie House is not acceptable, ma- a
ture another; let thie best lawyer of 't
thie two Houses prepare it. To e l I
sure, thie Supreme Couirt, when thle a
case get there, may sustain thie ral- tl
idity of thle action of the Electoral s
Commission and may refuse to reverse *
it, but the friends of honest govern- r
ment will at least have thie satisfer- ill
tion of knowing that nol right of up I'
peal had been denied them. The iia
chinery of justice msay turn out to be i
insufficient or defective, but still it Ire
shoulid he tried. ca
The House, on Tnesday, by a near- "
ly unanimous vote passed the Pacific '
Railroad finding bill, which now goes1
to thie White House for approval. An hI
effort to pass, as it Cone .from lthe lit
Senate, thie bill to repeal tihe Bank.
ruplt Act, met with opposition 0and lii
.mendments wete tmade the final pas- 1
sage of thle bill doubtful. The vote "f
on the bill, with, the amendmients, in of
the House, Was 206 ayes to .39 nayes. Ill
On Tuesday next thie Ways and "f
Means Committee of the House will P'
vote on lthe question of suspending a"
payments to thie Government sinking Pe
fund. This fund is larger by far than
the law requires, and there would Ie inj
considerable relief experienced if thie %
millions added to it were left in the tl
pockets of the people. The idea orig- '1
inated with Senator Beck, of Ken- lOn
