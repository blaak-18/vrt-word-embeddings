Topelta, Kan., is fast making a rep.

that center of culture is the report of
a shower of toads, which came down
so thick that a freight train was un

Cycling is slowly but surely chang"

silk hat is actually going out ol
vogue, killed by the bicycle. At
least 'hatters report that there is
scarcely any demand for the fall

another branch of business that has
been nearly ruined.

The machete about which we read so
much in the Cuban dispatches is the
tool with which the Cuban works when
he is not fighting. It is used in the
sugar fields to cut the cane and is a
combination of a knife and a hatchet.
It ip8iets a severe and mutilating
eound. Every one in Cuba owns a
machete, which is as necessary to the
Cuban as an ax to the New Englander.

lI3r Old Blue Muslin Gown.
When waxlights shine on diamonds' blaze,
On snowy shoulders' gleam,
There com:es a thought of other days;
I see as in a dream,
A dTinty table, spread at five,

And bo-hind the teacups. Margery

So round, s) ivory-fair;

Divino arms hidden there.

Why do nct manufacturers make
More muslin--plain soft blue-
And girls all other tints forsake
For that bewitching hue?
Well-gowned they are, and fair, I grant.
But there is not one can drown'
My memory of Margery
In her old blue muslin gown.
My cabtle s over-sea in Spain
Alas I how for away !
And it has a winsome chatelaine
Who wears no satins gay.
She waits, upon a vine-clad porch,
My coming home from town,
And she looks like none but Margery

A WOMAN'S MISTAKE,
LY DILLA HIGGINS.
The whirl and rumble of the train
began to abate, and the engine gave a
prolonged whistle as the brakeman
opened the car door, calling out the
name of the near by town.
Lucia Kane gave a start of surprise
as his sonorous utterance fell on her
ears.
Stanford! Why, that was Rhodes
Guilford's home?
Quick as lightning's flash her
thoughts flew back to the summer,
long since past,when Rhodes Guilford
had taught her the old, sweet story
of love, and had been all the world
to her. And indeed, spite of hasty
action, spite of years of estrange
ment, was he not yet first in her
heart?
Retrospection was suddenly inter
rupted by the voice of the conductor
relating to the inmates of the car that
a train had been derailed a mile or so
below the town, causing a probable
delay of about threo hours. A buzz
of excitement ran through the car as
:he passengers made preparations for
slighting and spending the time of
enforced delay in exploring the little
city. Lucia gathered up. her few
small belongings and follwed the
crowd, her thoughts still busy with
the past. 'The umal throng of car
riage drivers and baggage men were
on hand, and she, contrary to her
nsual etstom, fell easy prey to them,
tendering her valise to the Jehn who
irst accosted her, with an order
to drive her to a good hotel. Arriving,
she fotind her way to the ladies' par
lor, and sanulinto an easy chair, giv
ing herself up to recollectious of the
long ago.
They had been suc happy months
the one bright spot in her lonely,
neglected girlhood-these months
spent with her old aunt in Fairrille.
Thither Rhodes Guilford had come to
regain his health, which too close
appliocation to study had injured; and
together he and Lucia Kane had
strolled along the country lanes and
loitered away the beautiful moonlit
veonings, until life seemed glorified
by their tender passion, and many
fond vows were spoken between them.
Then came eeparation; Bhodes

loveless home in Brinton, where she
was little, more than a household

sure it is one, if you ever decide that
you were hasty and a little unjust, I
pray you put pride aside and let me
know. Do not fail, for to death's
door I shall be faithful to you--yes,
and beyond."
Eight yeits had passed on leaden
wings to Lucia. She had found out
her mistake, but pride had held firm
sway. Only once in the interval had
she heard from Rhodes; two years or
so after the parting a mutual friend
brought her news of his lonely studi
ons life. The knowledge had reopened
the old wounds and caused her so
much hea:t misery that shehad volun.
tarily plut from her the chance for
further reports by dropping all corre
spondence with her friend. She had
found her vocation, and she steadily
pursued it, striving to fill with ambi
tion and work the part of her woman's
heart where wifehood and eternity
should have flourished.
And now fate had brought her to
his very place of abode-uncouscious
ly on her part, for she had not no
ticed that Stanford was on her route.
The delay to this especial train at this
especial place, too-was it fate,or was
an all wise Providence overruling cir
cumstanuces for her good? Since she
had been led to Rhodes Guilford's
home, why not have the battle out
with pride herb and now?
She arose, and having the room to
herself, began to pace to and fro,
nervously clasping her hands as she
walked. A sudden noise in the street
attracted her attention, an.l she
paused by the window. Nothing but
a forlorn cur running by, with half a
dozen booting, yelling arabs of the
street at its heels. She was resuming
her walk when--merciful Heaven!
Surely her eyes had not failed her?
Just across the narrow street she saw
the sign "Rhodes Guilford, Attorney
at Law,"and behind it, just inside the
open window, the bowed form busily
engaged in writing was surely no other
than the subject of her thoughts.
Breathlessly she stood gazing, hid
den from outside view by the lace
drap.ries of the window, her heart
throbbing wildly. It was fate! Ah,
he had suffered, too ! With a touch
of feminine vanity she crossed the
room to the pier glass, and surveyed
with careful scrutiny the image it
presented to her. It was not the
fresh girlish bloom of eighteen she
saw, but the maturer face of twenty
six; yet there was comeliness and even
beauty, Lucia truthfully declared to
herself; and the form was as lithe and
as willowy as ever,with an added grace
of matured charms.
"To death's door I shall be faithful
to you, Lucia--yes, and beyond"
the words rang again in her ears.
With sudden decision she took
from her portfolio a c.ird, wrote
quickly a line or two, enclosed it in
an,envelope, which she addressed, and
rang for a messenger. VWhile waiting
she stole another glance at the busy
writer across the way.
"Ah, darling, how happy I shall
strive to make you to stone for these
wasted years of obstinate pride 1" she
cried under her breath as she gazed.,
-What a perfect turnout that was,
coming rapidly down the street!l Its
occupants sere a charming woman
and a bright faced little boy. "Iu
jnust such a phaeton as that will I drive
down to bring my husband home,"
dreamed Lucia.
The horses paused directly opposite,
afid the little man jumped out and
disappeared within the building. In
a moment Lucia saw the man she had
been watching drop his pen and grasp
his son in his arms, while she heard
Ithe childish treble pipe out, "Oh,
papal Me an' mamma's comed for
you early, 'cause it's my birfday, an'
you promised----"
But the rest of the sentence was
lost toLucia,, who dropped into a
chair, pale and trembling-so pale
that the'maid who had at that moment
answered her suminons lqoked curi
onuly at her, as she " "Are you
sick, miess? What di~ you want of
me?"
"Just s glass of water, please," an

As she watched them Ilazo up for a
moment, then blacken and turn to
ashes, so within her heart the last
fragments of her girlish romance were
consumed, and died away--nuver to
return.
As Rhodes Guilford drove leisurely
to his home that day, something in the
appearance of a swiftly walking
woman, just turning down a side
street that led towards the railway sta
tion, sent his thdughts roaming back.

"Reminded me of Lucia Knce,

"Wonder what's become of her? What

Japanese Wrestlers.
One of the greatest,if not the greatest,
amusement in Japan is to go and see
the wrestlers. Wrestlers may be found
in almost every city,and they travel in I
companies through the provinces. On 3

mats, sufficient to hold an audience of I

wrestlers are mostly big men, and t
the swells among them look as tall i
as Patagonians, and as big as Daniel I
Lambert. In ordinary Japanese wrest
ling,where a competitor may lose if he <
is thrown out of the ring, weight is an
important factor. The men are usually
matched in pairs, and they are called
upon by an usher,, who announces
their names according to a pre-ar.
ranged programme. Two names being
called, the men walk up the opposite
sides of a circle, about twelve or fit.

The next time they advance they

Sr.uke ajie;nt or two; but nsually it

round, and having a pecond drink of

a dozen times, until one having irri

spring, and the two are locked to

all manner of things go flying through

N'ot Enough for Two.
Patrick was the captain of a brick
schooner that plied between New York
and Haverstraw on the Hudson. One
day his schooner was loaded, ready to
start for New York. But Patrick
never gave the word to the crew to
cast off the hawsers and get under
way. 'Instead, he sat lazily swinging
his leg over the spokes of the wheel,
smoking his pipe.
The.owner of the brick-yard, who
was also the owner of the schooner,
seeing that ihe vessel had not started,
and wishing to have the load landed
in New York as soon as possible,
rushed down to the dock and irately
demanded of Patrick why he did not
get under way.
"Share, yer honor,there's no wind."

DELIBERATE AFRICAN NATIVES.
The natives are very deliberate in
their formalities. One who brings
you a message does not rush up and
deliver it, and bolt away. He first
puts the weapons in a place of safety,
then seats himself comfortably near
you on the ground,and after a breath
ing-spell tells what he has to say. He
does understand hurry. If you reach
a village at noon tod:ay, no matter how
important it may be to keep moving,
the chief will feel very much disap
pointed if you do not spend the whole
of the next day in camp in or near his
village.--.Century.
THE FROG AND THE TOAD.
The frog sat by a clear pond admir
ing his reflection in the water.
"Dear me! I had no idea before
that I was so handsome," said the
frog.
"What nice cheeks I have, and oh,
what an exquisite complexion."
Happening to take his eyes off the
water for a moment he saw his neigh
bor, the toad, also looking at himself
in it. Whereupon the frog hopped
away chuckling.
"That ridiculous old toad," he said
to himself. "Did anyone ever hear
of anything more absurd? Who'll
turn conceited next, I wonder?"

Cooper's 'Spy' is a tale of the Ameri

Lowell's 'Biglow Papers' is fuli of

A BJTS' BRIGHT IDEA.
A boy who lives on a big vegetable
farm just south of Chicago is born to
be a great inventor. There isn't a
doubt of it.
This fall his father had a large crop
of tomatoes, covering several acres of
ground. A few weeks ago they begai
to get ripe in large luautities, and it
kept several Imen busy picking them
and packing them into boxes and bas.

But, ulfurtunnatly, there were cer*
tain small birds in the neigliborhood
that were as well pleased with the
toma.. ,, as was the farmet. Ai
whenevre, re men's blacks were turned
dbou~wwoult 'onle those birds in a
perfect swarm and begin to peck Into
the ripe red frait. If they had co0
tented themselves with natlig u'a
few blg tomatoes it woulda's 'have
made so much difference,' bti they
peeked into dozens of thliem, and when
a tomato bas so m.ch as one little
hole in it it won't sell.
All this was very provoking to the
farmer, but our boy fond' aretmedy.
It happened that he hapis lively little
black dog that was verf fond of chas
ing chickens, and he. knew that if he
could be kept in the garden there
wouldn't be any more trouble from
birds. So our boy went out and druls
two stoot stakes forty or ifty fMet
apart near the tomato bed,' and 'be,
tween them he stretched astout wire,
on which he had first threaded a smali
ring. At one stake he placed an
box for a kenoel, and then he#the

they didn't dare to come, back. Lots
