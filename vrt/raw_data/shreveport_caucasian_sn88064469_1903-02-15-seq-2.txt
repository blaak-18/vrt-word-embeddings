Butte, Mont., Feb. 13.-The Burling.
ton express No. 6, east bound, was
held up shortly after midnight yester
day morning on the Northern Pacific
tracks eight miles east of this city,
near Homestead, by five mounted
men. The train was a double header
and the engines, with the mail and
express cars, were run about 600 feet
ahead of the rest of the train. In
a few moments after the train stop
ped there were two explosions of dy
namite, which wrecked the express
car. The roof was blown off, but
no one was injured.
Reports as to the amount of booty
secured by the robbers vary The
express messenger says the robbers
did not get more than $500. In other
quarters it is said the plunder will
amount to several thousand dollars
at least. It is also said that several
mail pouches were rifled. A railway
mail clerk was shot in the holdup.
It is not thought his wounds are dan
gerous.
When the express messenger real
ized there was a holdup he tossed a
package of money he held in his hand
upon the rack above his head and
this money was probably saved. 'This
fact can not be definitely known,.
however, until an opportunity is given
for a search of the wrecked car.

Washington. Feb. .--The mystery of
President Roosevelt's visits to the Ten
nallytown woods. which he has been
making every morning for several days,
has been solved. After the manner of
England's 'grand old man' he has
been felling trees primarily for the pur.
pose of working off sonme of his surplus
energy and incidentally i, remove the
superfluous growth of the forest.
The forest belongs to the dAut(t ie

Representative Kahn of Ualifornla
recently received a petition from a San
Francisco constituent
for the introduction of
some mechanism "to
Its penetrate the heavenly
Jurisdiction bodies." With the com
munication were a dia
gram and an explanation of the partic
ular invention The diagram was full
of wheels, and it might have been in
ferred that the head of the petitioner
was in a like condition. Anyway, Mr.
Kahn was puzzled over the matter. He
did not know what to do with the peti
tion. He did not want to offend his
constituent; neither could he offer such
a bill in congress. for he, was aware
that it could not receive consideration.
A bright thought finally struck the
San Franciscan. He took his pen and
wrote: "I regret very much that I can
not comply with your request. Congress
has no jurisdiction over heavenly
bodies."
The senate was entertained with
spirited repartee the other day, in
which Mr. Beveridge of
Staying the Indiana and Mr. Bur
ton of Kansas were the
Floods principals, with Mr.
- Hoar of Massachusetts
acting as a sort of final arbitrator.
The theme on which both Mr. Bevy
eridge and Mr. Burton spoke with some
heat was irrigation in general and the
staying of floods in particular. They
had divergent ideas, which were dem
onstrated in voluminous speaking. The
Kansas man had a turn and advanced
two distinct and separate propositions.
"in one of his statements the senator
is correct," remarked Mr. Beveridge;
"in the other he. is not correct."
Mr. Burton hesitated a moment to
take in the effect of the utterance. "I
am glad to know I got one right," he
said finally.
"So am I, and surprised." retorted
Mr. Beveridge.
This time Mr. Burton did not pause
so long, but quick as a flash exclaimed:
"The senator is always surprised if
any one except himself is right."
At this point Senator Hoar rose and
gazed benignly through his spectacles
at the disputants.
"The gentlemen." said he in the calm
est tones, enforcing the fact that the
senators had been disputing for a very
long time, "are talking about the im
possibility of staying the floods and
themselves giving the best possible
illustration of the truth of it."
A titter went round the chamber and
the debate proceeded on more serious
lines.

"But he must be in," the presiden$

The colloquy resulted in the conclu

said, with some impatience:
"I know he is in. Tell him the presi

"De president ob what?" asked the
