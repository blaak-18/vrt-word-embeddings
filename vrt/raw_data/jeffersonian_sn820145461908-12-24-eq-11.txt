Nervous
Break-Down
Nerve energy is the
force that controls the or
gans of respiration, cir
culation, digestion and
elimination. When you
feel weak, ftervous, irri
table, sick, it is often be
cause you lack nerve
energy, and the process
of rebuilding and sustain
ing life is interfered with.
Dr. Miles’ Nervine has
cured thousands of such
cases, and will we believe
benefit if not entirely
cure you. Try it.
“My nervous system gave away
completely, and left me on the verge
of the grave. I tried skilled physi
cians but got no permanent relief.
I got so bad I had to give up my
business. I began taking Dr. Miles’
Restorative Nervine. In a few days
I was much better, and I continued
to improve until entirely cured. I
am in business again, and never miss
an opportunity to recommend this
remedy.” MRS. W. L. BURKE,
Myrtle Creek, Oregon.

The 'Real Christmas
The world has a strange habit
hiding away under the glamour of vis
ible beauty and brightness much that
would moisten the eyes to see, and
burden the heart to know. In city
streets, where joyous throngs on pleas
ure bent crowd the pathways, the air
is full of laughter and the pleasant
speech of men and women to whom
the world is kind. The evergreen hol
ly, with its ruddy berries, the flow
ers with radiant color, the fruits that
find summer in palaces of glass, vie
with the diamonds and rubies that
rich men buy to prove their Christmas
kindness, and the laughter that we
hear sounds like a general chorus to
the bursts of music that from all sorts
of places try to tune the hearts of the
listeners to the festival that is com
ing tomorrow. For it is Christmas
Eve in a great city street!
It is hardly possible to believe that
what we see and hear is not typical
of the general condition; that the
same eager anticipation of the peace
and plenty of the great Christ-day
does not exist from one extremity of
the city to the other. Do we ever
remember the action of the laws that
work in us, and try to understand
that all of us are apt to take our own
thoughts and feelings and cover the
lives of all our fellows with them ? If
we are satisfied, we imagine everyone
else must be; our content ought to
be enough for all the world. On this
coming Christmas day may every
mother who reads these words have
her heart’s desire, and may she re
member, too, that in our land the
Lord who came to us long ago is with
us still, and in his loving grace be
stows enough of all needful things to
satisfy all who hunger with hunger
of body or soul; that there is no need
of want, or misery, or hate, and that
there might be none on -Christmas day
this year if only the good and kind
and wise had in former years under
stood that, while they feasted and
sang, their joy would find sharp con
trast in the destitution that was lit
erally within arm’s reach of them
all.
All through the long hours of the
Christmas Eve and far into the early
morning, there are little boys and
girls, ill-clad, hungry, facing the bit
ing winds, with slush-sodden feet, try
ing to earn a few cents to buy dry
bread for a Christmas feast. Women
there are who are alone and sick,
fighting the deadly weakness that is
born of exhaustion, toiling on
through the slow passing minutes till
the dawn, that they may not die of
hunger. Ragged, homeless men crowd
into the dirty refuges for the vagrant,
- to lie tossing restlessly about, cough
ing in choruses of agony, thinking
in dull horror of the better Christ
mases in days gone by. And into the
hearts of all the unfortunate, not one
bright gleam of hope shines to drive
despair away; they are living in, not
passing through, the valley of the
shadow of death.
And there are lives immeasurably
worse than these —young girls driven
by drunken parents into the streets at
midnight, when the Christmas bells
are ringing; wives beaten by men
Bl,® Jeffersonian
fresh from saloon bars where they
were making ready for Christmas
day. What must God think when
groans and shrieks from helpless hu
man lips rise up from sordid homes,
and mingle with the music of the bells
that tell the world that God’s Son
loved them all and came to earth to
bring good-will and peace? Or rath
er, what should Christian mothers
think, and Christian fathers do, to
end the discord and give to the Christ
the world he died to save?
Not only the passing charity of the
day, not merely the good dinner, the
warm clothes, and the kindly words—
all these are good; how good those on
ly know who know well the poor. But
the child Christ was born that he
might make strong men and good
women who would both work and
pray for the uplifting of the sinful
and fallen; who would see clearly into
the causes of common misery and nev
er rest until they were removed; who
would struggle that God’s abundance
of garnered wheat, and God’s plenty
of common joy, might feed the lips of
the hungry in darkened slum, and
gladden the souls that are desolate in
ev,ery sin-cursed hovel in God’s fav
ored land, and, while they ministered
to prevent need, would labor in the
spirit of the Christ to move the pow
ers that rule the people to make the
promise of the angels’ song a univer
sal fact. Do not forget why the
Christ came; that it was to make pov
erty needless, to deliver the victims
of the sins of others, to save us all
from sins of our own, and for this end
he was working the whole year round,
and so he expects us all to do. And
thus the Christmas charity will be a
permanent emotion, forcing us to work
so that every coming Christmas day
will be a better one for all men
through the constant force of Chris
tian wisdom working for the day
when
“There shall be no more curse,
No more of pain and careworn faces,
no forms bowed with disease,
O’er all the earth the Lord replaces
the paradise of ease,
No more the curse, no more the dy
ing; all thirst and hunger o ’er.
No more the night, no more the dy
ing, no tears or sorrow more.”
What a blessed Christmas day that
will be! What a glorious aim to work
to bring it nearer to both rich and
poor!—Mother’s Magazine.
