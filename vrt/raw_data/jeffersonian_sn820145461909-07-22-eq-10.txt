The Individuality of Races
The family tree of humanity has
many branches. The original stock
of mankind developed three great di
visions, the ruddy races, the brown
races and the black races, and these
in their turn sub-divided into clans,
tribes and nations, representing the
wide dispersion of the human family.
Man is a creature of soil and cli
mate. Like the vital force of the
vegetable world, he responds to his
physical environment and flourishes
or dwindles accordingly as his sur
roundings are favorable to him or
otherwise. He has the power of
transplanting himself, and the migra
tory instinct has impelled him to
w r ander from pole to pole and from
sea to sea.
The character of a race is com
posite of the tribal experience. In
the course of race migrations various
ethnic characteristics are developed
and brought out by the different en
vironments through which the race
passed. Travel seems to have been
the first educator, and Necessity was
a school teacher before she was the
mother of Invention.
The race that traveled farthest has
not attained the highest development,
though the one that traveled least is
most barbaric. The race that travel
ed in the most favored latitude for
human development is the one that
has outstripped all others in advance
ment. The Ruddy Races have, as a
rule, had sufficient climatic in
clemency to battle with to give them
ballast. In the northern latitudes
they learned to subsist by their own
ingenuity rather than upon the scanty
bounty of Nature. When man began
to do things for himself a new field
of possibilities was opened to him,
and the farthei’ he has advanced into
this field the farther has his per
spective of the horizon of the possible
been advanced before him.
Man is not only the creature of en
vironment, but of all the environ
ments he has passed through. The
past has left its residue in passing.
The seed is affected by the habit of
the parent plant, as well as by the
soil in which it germinates.
The Human Family is very old.
We are not all brothers in this day
and generation. The natural divis
ions of the family have made cousins
most numerous. In a primeval sense
we were brothers, but the develop
ment of race character and the differ
entiation of time has separated the
Human Family in degrees of develop
ment and ethnic temperament until
some of the cousinship between the
more removed branches have become
manifestly remote.
The character of a race or people
is gradually absorbed from environ
ment. It is centuries in developing
into a distinct quality or combina
tion of qualities that may be called
race individuality, but once develop
ed it partakes of the natural instinct
of self-preservation. This action of
the natural law of selection is often
miscalled race prejudice. It is a pro
vision of Nature that the individuals
of a race prefer their own kind. It
is a kind of instinctive loyalty that
binds them to their kind. The more
highly developed the race is, the
more strongly this instinct of race
Zsbe Jeffersonian
individuality is felt. Under barbaric
influences it breaks out into race
wars. Under civilized circumstances
it results in the domination of the
more advanced race.
Nature has placed her ban on the
mixture of widely different races.
Neither of the great races will suc
cessfully fuse with the others. No
tably in the case of the negro and the
white, the mulatto half-breed does
not reproduce himself, but deterio
rates into the lower race after a few
generations. This is true of all half
breeds of widely different races —
they deteriorate to the lower race
after a few generations, indicating
that they were merely an emulsion
rather than a mixture.
The races that have united and
blended together in the production
of other races were similar in ethnic
qualities and character. In such
cases there was no natural aver
sion to the mixture, but the aversion
of a higher race for a lower race is
a natural instinct and is no more a
prejudice than the instinct of self
preservation. It is Nature’s precau
tion for the preservation of the in
dividuality of races.
The natural aversion of a more ad
vanced race for a less advanced race
is not affected by time or commercial
association —it remains while Nature
rules. It is Nature’s justice, right
and law. It is no respecter of races,
operating as much in behalf of the
one as the other. All down the ages
Nature has been marking ethnic
characteristics and differentiations,
and to preserve the distinctions she
has marked radical boundaries with
natural aversions and the instinct of
preservation of race individuality
guards the borderland.

TURKS ARE GOING TO BE EDU
CATED ANYWAY.
Dear Sir: —I clipped the attached
news item from “late news notes,”
the Cherokee Advance, Canton, Ga.,
July 2, 1909:
“The American board of commis
sioners of Foreign Missions will start
in July to raise a fund of $2,000,000
for the enlargement of all the edu
cational institutions in foreign lands
under its supervision. Fully one
third of the amount will be used in
Turkey, according to an officer of
the board. The growth there has
been greater than in other countries.
Many of the colleges in Turkey and
China can not accommodate all of
the students that apply for admis
sion. A permanent endowment fund
of SIOO,OOO for each institution is
desired by the board, which believes
that an income that can be depended
upon will insure better work.”
Possibly some little Jack Leg
Preacher will say that this is another
one of “Tom Watson’s lies.” This F.
M. Graft, and that is just what it is,
has driven many thousands of good
men and women out of the Christian
Church. lam one of them.
Very truly,
T. A. DOLAN.
