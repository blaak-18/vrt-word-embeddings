wood was six
teen, and a
frank, honest, impulsive lad, as one
read in his blue eyes. Nick Bolter was.
c older by two years. and his otherwise
y pleasing' face was marred by a grasp
b ing~look.
t A covered buggy drawn by a lean
white horse rattled up to the gate and
stopped, and a large man in gray
homespun jumped out.
The stopping of the vehicle brought
Teddy's father out of the house and
down to the gate.
*'Mornip', Kirkwood," growled the
visitor. "Seen anything o' that bound
boy of mine-young Joe Hackett?"
Mr. Kirkwood shook his head. "Did
you lose him?" he asked.
• He ran away last night," replied
the angry farmer, "an' stole putrty near
everything he could lay his hands on."
"'Any valuables, oh?"
"Waal, no, admitted the farmer. "It
was all in ~ Eing line. He cleaned
out the panti"% ,What riles me is the

boy like my own son, fed an' clothed
him, and looked after his moral bring

me. aut I'll fix him when I get him
back. " He's legally bound over to me
till he comes of age, and I ain't goin'
to 1lt him slip. You boys goin' hunt
in'9" and the farmer turned sharply to
.Teddy.
"Weire going to try our luck for
squirrels." the lad replied.
"Then keep a lookout for the young
rascaL If you catch him and bring
him to my place I'll give you five dol
Iars-a two-dollar-and-a-half gold piece
for-each of you."
With a smack at his rocket that
made the coins therein jingle, ir.
Jefferson Skimmer leaped into the
buggy and drove swiftly of.
"I saw Joe Hackett the last time I
was up in the valley," said Teddy. "lHo
was cutting corn, and he had only one
suspender. I wonder if he really is on
the mountain? I'dl like to earn the re
ward. Two dollars and a half will buy
lots of things I want."
The boys crossed the road and
plodded through the sloping belt of
pine trees, discussing as they went
along the chances of finding the fugi
tive.
When they reached the heavier tim
ber on the upper part of the mountain
they found other things to think
about. The sharp barking of squirrels
was heard all around them, and they
vanced with noiseless tread, stop
ing nuw and then to watch and listen.
At noon they were several miles from
home, and on the Sat top ot the moun
tain. After eating a part of their
lunch they stretched themselves lazily
d.a the dead leaves and lay there for
se~eral hours. looking up into the t

"You ran away," answered Teddy,
in a tone of virtuous indignation,
"and you stole something from the
pantry."
t+ "No I didt. I only took an apple
pie and two pf e s of dry bread. And
I wouldn't have taken them, only I
was half starved."
"Here, take this." Teddy handed
y out what was left of his lunch and the
lad began to eat in a ravenous fashion.
"Why did you run off, Joe?" he
a asked.
The lad detected a note of kindness
and sympathy in the question. "I'll
tell you," he replied. "Say, you've got
a good home, ain't you?"
"As good a one as a fellow need
want," Teddy replied warmly.
"So had I," Joe went on, "and only
a year ago. You've heard about it. I
reckon. We lived on Jackson's farm
as ten ants-father an' mother an' me.
Then a tree fell on father an' killed
him, and in June mother died. Then
the county bound me over to Jefferson

"That was in July, and since then

o'clock and worked till seven, and
f never a kind word-only cursin' and

pulled up his sleeves and showed a
mass of bruises on each arm from the

"I guess I wouldn't," exclaimed
Teddy.
"Do you mind Bill Martin. what

used to live this side of Rockville."
"Yes, I remember," said Teddy. "le
was an awful nice man."
"You bet he was," assented Joe.
S"Well, I seen him a month ago, an' he
told me when I got tired standin' Jef

Sreight train out to the farm in Ohio,
where his parents live. So that's why
I ran off; but now"-Joe's voice broke
a little. lie rubbed a tear from each
grimy cheek, and looked sadly at his
ragged shoes.
Teddy thought of the promised gold
piece within his grasp, hesitated rue
fully and then made up his mind with
boyish promptness.
i "I ain't mean enough to take you
back to Jeff Skimmer, law or no law,"
he suid. "Here's twenty cents. Joe,

I'd hide in the next valley till to-mor

Yes, the bushes were rustling close
by. A sharp whistle trilled on the
air.
"But I can't," half cried Joe; "not
fast, anyway. I sprained my ankle on a
stone."
"Now you've done it," whispered 1
Teddy, looking over his shoulder.
"Here comes Nick." Then, as a sudo a
den idea struck him. he added, excit- <
edly: 'Drop behind that rock, Joe.
"N.%O YOU DO 'T, JON IIACEETT'."
quick! 1When you hear me yell the
third time cut down into the back val
ley as fast as you can. Understand!"
Joe nodded as he rolled noiselessly
into the bushy hollow behind the rook.
Teddy dashed across the glade in the
opposite direction from which Nick t
was approaching.
As he ran he took care to make
plenty of noise, and when a violent ",
commotion in the bushes behind told t,
him that his plot was a success he I
gare three lusty shouts.
After that he sped along through
the trees with great leaps, yelling
loudly at intervals: "Hold on, Joel
Stop, atop!"
Nearer and nearer came the r..pid
threshing of his pursuer, and .vhen a
slippery stone threw Teddy into a
clump qof bushes, he was violently
pounced upon before he could rise.
"You." Nick gasped in wrathful
amazement, when he saw who it was
that he had eptured. "You've tricked p
me, Ted Kirkwood."
As soon as Teddy could get his
breath he made a clean breast of ev
erything except Joe's future plans,
concerning which he was discreetly i
silent. i
He hoped to arduse his companion's
sympathies, but Nick plainly had none

ONION CULTIVATION.
A Crop Th :t Requreis ·irh and Carefally
Prepared Soil.
l It requires rich land to grow good
onions, and it must be fertility that
has been gradually intimrted to the
i soil. You cannot take ordinary farm
'- land and in a single season fit it for
r growing onions. If stable manure is
used, it makes the soil too light while i
t it is decomposing. The best onions
are grown on mucky soil that has
a several seasons been cultivated to
a shallow depth, and that is then kept
in i.tility with some kind of con
i centraed manure. There needs to be
a hard stratum of soil three or four
inches below the surface. This makes
I the onion roots spread out near the v
surface, producing onions of flat
Sshape. When the soil is mellowed too
deeply a large proportion of the
crop will grow to scullions.
The seed from scullions will pro
duce scullions in return. As there is a
constant tendency to deterioration it
is highly immportaut that only the best t
seed be used. The skillful seed
grower understands this difference, c
and his seed from onions that have for
many crops been selected from those b
having the best form is well worth the
best profits in growing onions are now
made by starting the growth the pre
vious season, planting very thickly ii
and saving the sets while they are ft
small. These are transplanted in i
spring, and produce an earlier crop f
than can be had from seed. They also .,
are much less trouble to keep free from to
weeds, as the rows of young onions
can be seen within a few days after d
planting, and they grow very rapidly. u

For mature fattening steers the pro

pears to be of less importance than for w
almost any other class of live stock. et
Within pretty wide limits, it is a ques- in
tion chiefly of quantity of food, rather st
than of quality, in the chemical sense, at
and therefore that food is to be pre- w
ferred which furnishes digestible mat- tL

According to these figures, corn and hj

more expensive. A combination of li
these two with cut corn fodder would so
probably give satisfactory results, al- of
though it is possible that a small ad- pa

improvement. The quantity fed
should be as great as the animals will

A sled or boat that will quickly un- o

If one desires to have the sled always

be used, thus those that are not in use
as runners serve as side boards for

though not too much. Great pains m
should always be taken to keep the tl
cultivator going until the vines nearly d(
meet between the rows, if they are to ti

some little time before planting; bet- T

in order that the chlorine may wash c8

POLITICAL UPHEAVALS.
W ttletlcal Reasonlag of a Would-Re Re
publlcan President.
ir Ion. Thomas B. Reed has an article
a. in the North American Review for
le January on "Historic Political 'Upheavr
14 als." He touches lightly upon the
a- changes which followed the French
Ln revolution, notes the execution of
re Charles I., the rise of Cromwell, the
A restoration of the Stuarts and the com
v- plete and permanent revolution of
c. 1688, and then comes down to our own
ni history. Alluding briefly to the large
st majority cast for Franklin Pierce.in
e- 1852, he says it was then supposed that
a the slavery question was settled, which
everybody knows was a great mistake.
se Then he tells of the big republican vic
Ld tory of 1872, which was followed by
a, the republican overthrow in 1874, and
comes down to the elections of 1890,
It 1892, 1893 and 1894. What happened in
a these years is, of course, fresh in the
oe minds of newspaper readers.
re We note in Mr. Reed's article a fail
i. ure to deduce the logical consequences
of the facts which he adduces, and
er even to apply at the end the principles
it which he enunciated at the beginning
d of his article.
:r All the lessons laid down in the first
d half of the article tend to show how
baseless is the confidence in permanency
at of power for the party which happens
d to be the beneficiary of a great politic
4 al upheaval. When the French rove
a lution occurred, people thought there
would be no more kings and nobles.
e They were disappointed. When the
8 HLourbons were restored everybody
thought the old days had returned to
it stay: They, too, were deceived. So it
Ia went all along the line, until the clec
y ."ion of 1894 was reached, when Mr.
5 Reed. instead of warning his party that
r- this was in no sense a guaranty of its
continuance in power, contented him
self with saying that the elections of
last November "seem to have settled
! the future of this country for many
years." This appeared to afford a good
.i opening for Mr. Reed to add that
S"things are not what they seem." but
he failed to utilize it. On the contrary,
d he concluded his article with a few ob
servations which imply that the re
publicans are going to rule the country
d to the end of time.
1 Mr. Reed's explanation of the disas
ters of 1890 and 1892 is peculiar. When
he says that the passage of the taCiff
bill should have taken place by the
middle of July we understand him well
enough. No doubt the republicans suf
fered in 1890 from delay in passing the
tariff bill, just as the democrats did in
1891. But when he brings in the Bar
Ing failure to supplement it he re
verses history, for that did not occur i
till after the election. Nor is it true
that the "influences which produced
the Baring failure," as Mr. Reed ex
presses it, were discernible before the
election of 190. But after this failure.
had been influencing business unfavor
t bly for two years. Mlr. Reed says that i
in 1892 the republicans had to meet 4
"the unrest that comes slowly with too 1
aniformi prosperity." Thus the reprib- 1
licans were slaughtered "a-comin' and 4
Sa-gwine." In 1800 the Barin-g failure I
made times hard before it occurred, 1
and in 1892 the too uniform prosperity a
that the people had enjoyed after the 1
failure made them smite the republic
an party hip and thigh.
This reasoning will strengthen the 1
current opinion that Mr. Reed is first C
of all a humorist. This is further rein
forced by his saying that the repub
lican party suffered in 1602 from gerry- i
manders of the worst character, a
though it is known that gerrymanders
do not figure in the choice of presiden
tialelectors, in which respect the de- F
feat of the republicans was most con- r
spicuous. Nor did the gerrymanders t
prevent the republicans from getbing r
a great majority of congressmen at the I
last election.
It is unfortunate that aMr. Reed was
not able to finish his article in the I
philosophical strain in which he began
it; but the reason is clear enough.
There was a war between Mr. Reed, t
the philosopher, and Mr. Reed, the c
candidate for the presidency. The c
philosopher said enough in the begin- d
ning to warn the republicans that n
their landslide of 1894 may not avail t
them in 1896, but the candidate felt o
impelled to tell them at the close that I
they will continue to rule the country. d
"it may be for years, and it may be for- t
ever." For all that the application of v
Mr. Reed's facts shows that the result I1
of the election of 1896 is as doubtful as t
future events generally are; and it is
equally doubtful whether a republican v
victory in that year would inure to n
the benefit of 'Mr. Recd.-Louisville p

DEMOCRACY DEPINED. -
P- rposes and Yrlmepltes Ma" Apees aes
Hteams Weissa,.
ee There were some yearsin the history
r of the party when it earned the appel
lation of bourbon and the definition of
e the word, one who never learns and
h never forgets. It grew to be considered
i the conservative party of the union,
e using the word in its sense of resis
- tance to every progressive movement.
d It was officered by a lot of eminently
a respectable old fossils who could not
e bear the strain on their nerves and in
n tellects that a consideration of any new
t and better way of doing things in
vh olved. They were the statesmen of
the rut. They-dominated the party be
fore and for long after the war. Prin
P ciples were too vigorous and exacting
Sfor them; they preferred the "'lean and
, slippered pantaloon" of policy.
Judging from words spoken and
a printed now, there are men who think
that they are democrats who assert
that the party can have nothing to do
s with any of the new questions that are
I coming on, as they hare always come
on, and always will among progressive
r races; but that the party must assume
a position of opposition and hqstility to
t them. They prate aboun the tradition
a! policy of the party assuming that
r its traditions bear no older date than
the fifties. They are evidently ignor
ant that the party in this country had
its birth in the first progressive move
ments that sought to break the crust
of federalism. The founder of the
party was the radical of his day. He
stirred the country with new ideas.
>He was born a revolutionist, and many
of our most fixed policies are the chil
dren of his revolutionary brain. The
divorce of church and state, the blow
at oligarchy which his abolition of the
law of primogeniture struck are some
of these. It was not until in recent
years the party shook off the lethargy
I of the conservatives and became pro
gressivc that it has come up out of it
deserved subordination. It was when
the mossbacks were sent to the rear
that the party inspired the confidence
that gained its recruits and gave it
victory.
There is no room in any nation for
two conservative parties to co-exist.
The republican party lost years ago its
initiative of progress, and has been
contented to merely administer the gov
ernment, meeting the exigencies as
they arose as best it could by tempor
ary expedients. It had a spasm of
progress along its chosen line of policy
in 1890. but the evidence is plentiful
that it regrets the advance it made,
and will retreat from it when again in
power. It will accept the tariff act of
tthis congress; it will abjure force bills.
and it will dodge and hedge on the cur.
rency.
This leaves the democracy only the
avenue of meeting the new questions
of the day frankly, bravely and with a
view to examine and test and approve
if they chord with the basic principles
of the party. To free trade, to the na
tionalization of railways, to the single
tax, the sole question is: Are they
democratic? Adapting Paul's counsel,
it would "prove all things: hold fast
those which are democratic." Do they
abridge individual freedom? Reject
themn. Do they take power from the
state and transmute it into liberty for
the citizen? Do they take from priv.
ilego the advantage it wrongfully
gained and unjustly holds, and restore
equality? Then frankly accept them
and advocate them, assured that what
is right is democratic, and the reverse,
and that what is not democratic is.
wrong and dangerous. Whether the
party does this or not, affects only the
party. Any idea that establishes its
right to live will find a party in good
time, and it is only the worse. for the
party that shuts its door on it.-St.
Paul Globe.

is on Wool.
With the beginning of the new year,
the democratic tariff on wool and on
clothing takes effect. The provisions
of-this democratic measure take off the
duty on wool and reduce the duty on
manufactured clothing. The effect of
this measure will be to reduce the cost
of the clothing of the people of the
United States the amount of two hun
dred million dollars a year. This "is
the equivalent of the duties levied on
wool and woolen cloths by the McKin
ley tariff and of the reduction made by
the democratic tariff.
It will be easy for anyone who uses
wool in any way as an article either of
manufacture or personal apparel to
prove the amount of this reduction by+
the t1'fference in the market price, not
only in the trade, but in there t' stores.

The American manufacturer and the
American workingman is capable of
competing with all the other manufac

he has his raw materials and his sources
of production free from taxation. The
McKinley tariff put the burden of its
high taxation on the raw wool. That
increased the price to the manufactur
er and made it necessary for him to re
coup himself by a tariff on his product.
This tariff compounded by interest and
profits piled up so high that the Ameri
