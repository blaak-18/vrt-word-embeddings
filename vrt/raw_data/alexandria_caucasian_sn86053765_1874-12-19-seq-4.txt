VINECAR BITTERS
Dr. JT. Walker's California
Yinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of Vinegar B it
ters ?" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers bis health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-givin<* principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of tho system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vur
soar Bitters in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. Thor are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of D r . W alk
ir's V inegar B itters are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

THE APPROACH of the Preside))tin
Election gives unusual importance to tin»
events and developments of 1875. We
shall endeavor to <le*cribo them fully,
faithfully, and fearlessly.
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attained
a circulation of over seventy thousand
copies. -Its renders nro found in every
State and Territory, and itst|iiality is weil
known to the public. We shall riot only
endeavor to keep it fully up to the old
standard, but to improve and add to its
variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will.continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All the news
of the day will be found in it, condensed
when unimportant, at full length when of
moment, and always, we trust, treated in
it clear, interesting and instructive manner
It is our aim to make the WEEKLY
SUN tho best family newspaper in the
world. It will be full of entertaining and
, appropriate reading of every sort, but will
print nothing to offend the most, hci 11 pu
ions and delicate taste. It will always
contaiu the most interesting stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a prom
inent feature in the WEEKLY SUN, and
its articles will always bo found fretdi aud
useful to the farmer.
The number of men independent in pol
itics is increasing, and the WEEKLY 8UN
is their paper especially. It belongs to
no party, and obeys no dictation, contend
ing for principle, arid for the election of
the best men. It exposes the corruption
that disgraces the country and threatens
the overthrow of republican institutions.
It lias no fear of knaves, and seeks 110 fa
vors from their supporters.
The markets ot' every kind and the fash
ions are regnbtrly reported in its columns.
The price of the. WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages, and
lifty-six columns. As this barely psys the
expenses ot" i> : «pcr and printing, we are
not able to ni;?ke any discount or allow
any pr-a, ;m to friends who may make
special . i .'. uïs to extend its circulation.
Under t". new law. which requires pay
ment of I -»stage in advance, one dollar a
year, with tw-nty cents the cost of pre
paid postage added, is the rate of subscrip
tion It is not necessary to <;e.t up a club
in order to have the WEEKLY SUN at
this rate. Any one who sends one dollar
and twenty cents will get the paper, post
paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.—Eight pages, fif
ty-si* columns. Only $1.20 a year .postage
prepaid. No discounts from this rate.
THE DAILY SUN.—A large four-page
newspaper of twenty eight columns. Dai
ly circulation over 120,000. All the news
for 2 cents. Subscription, postage pre
paid 55 cents a month, or$<».50 a year. To
clubs of 10 or over, a discount of 20 per
cent. Address,
