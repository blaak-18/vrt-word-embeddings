the theatrical season in Lafayette
with a performance at Falk's hall
last week. Some of the actors were

Third Time a Convict.
For the third time in his life the
negro, Sam. Dugas, stands convict
ed of larceny. The last offense for
which he will serve his country is
the stealing of two cattle hides.
His case came up for trial last
Wednesday, and, contrary to ex
pectation, be pleaded guilty. Last
year he was tried for stealing a calf,
and pleaded his own case and was
acquitted. It was thought that he
would again . attempt to prove his
innocence, but he unexpectedly
came forwarJl, entered a plea of
guilty and asked for the mercy of
the court. "'Big Sam" is well, if
not favorably, known by nearly
every person in this parish. He is
a notorious thief, and, yet, he is
not considejed a particularly vi
cious or dangerous negro. Inumner
able petty thefts may be safely
charged to him, but he has never
been caught stealing anything of
much value. His forte is the chick
en-coop, and he is probably the
most successful and experienced
chicken thief in the South. This
is, perhaps, an extravagant asser
tion, but Sam is undoubtedly enti
tled to the distinction. He says
that his fingers have a peculiar fas
cinatios for chickens, hogs, calves
and hides, and that he is in no
wise responsible if they cling to
them. He says in the present case
he is the victim of circumstances,
and, although he plead guilty, is in
hnocent. He has hopes that the
judge will sentence him to the par
ish prison, and that he will not be
sent to the penitentiary; however,
should the judge deem proper to
confine him to the walls of the State
prison, he does not anticipate the
trials and suffering that necessarily
attend the life of a stranger in so
gloomy a place. He has been
there twice, and the "pen" has no
terrors for him. He is a good cook
and, with his natural cunning and
his reputation as an epicure, he
will, in all probability, be put to
work in the kitchen.
It remains to be seen whether a
third term of imprisonment will
have a reforming influence on Sam.
He is rather a hard subject, and his
conversion would be little short of
a miracle. He is one of the thou
sands of unfortunate negroes who
are born and reared in crime, and
who live and die in it. From child
hood they are taught to look at the
neighbor's chicken as public prop
erty, and the penitentiary is a nat
ural sequence to their early train
ing.

The case of Martin Bagley was
called up for trial before Judge
Allen Thursday morning. Judge
Jno. Clegg, of New Orleans, Hon.
Lucius Suthon, of Terrebone, and
Charles Fontelieu, of Iberia, ap
peared for the defense and M. T.
Gordy represented the State. The
defense made a motion for contin
uance on the ground that two of
their counsel, Judge C. Debaillon
and Jos. A. Chargois, were sick and
could not take part in the trial. Mr.
Gordy insisted upon a trial and
made a strong plea against another
continuance. The judge took the
matter under advisment and at 2
o'clock gave his decision overruling
the motion for a continuance, and
the trial was immediately begun.
The empannelling of the jury
was commenced and at 5 o'cloclk
when the venire was exhausted ten
jurors had been sworn in. The judge
ordered the sheriff to summon ten
tallesmen and the court took a recess
until 7 o'clock p. m., when the jury
was completed. The following
gentlemen compose the jury: Ar

The committee app)ointed by the
B. M. A. and the City Council met
last Monday in Judge O. C. Mou
ton's office and organized by elect
ing T. M. Biossat chairman, and J.
r. Bell secretary. There was a
marked enthusiasm and sincerity of
purpose in the deliberations of the
committee.
It was decided to advertise in the
Times-Democrat, of New Orleans,
for estimates, and the secretary was
requested to open correspondence
with contractors, with a view of as
certaining the probable cost of the
erection of the contemplated im
provements. It is proposed to find
out what the expenditure will be,
and then other steps will be taken
toward the completion of the pro
ject. Of course, the only way to
raise the money is by taxation; and
before the tax-payers will vote on
the question it is well that they be
thoroughly informed as to costs,
etc. The gentlemen interested in
this movement have been at work
with a vim that is really commend
able, and it is to be hoped that they
will continue to show the same
public spirit which has so far char
acterized their efforts. We say let
the good work go on I
A Charming Composition.
The following complimentary no
tice to a young lady well-known in
Lafayette will doubtless be read
with pleasure by many of our
readers. It is taken from the
September number of the "Salve
Regina:"
Just out, Padcrwiski's l/Velcome,
a beautiful waltz by Miss Gene
vieve Salles, of our city. Miss
Salles has the soul of a genuine ar
tist; her early work gives promise of
great things to come. If her talent
and the charm of her compositions
fail to satisfy the expectations her
work has already aroused, the cause
must be sought outside herself. In
her compositions one finds a plain
tiveness, a sweeting that are as
touching as charming. Had her
star risen under other auspices, she
might have devoted her whole
energies to classic music, as it is,
she must divide attention and give
time to that which is less stubtile,
but more pleasant to the public
ear. We trust Pa'derwiski's WIel
come ,shall find the sale it deserves.
Any dtsirous to honor the great
compou'ur, who is expected to visit
our city this winter, should pur

About Lafayette.
We find the following in the col
umns of that excellent little maga
zine, "Salve Regina," edited,
printed and published by the young
ladies of the St. Mary's Dominican
Academy of New Orleans. Miss
May Scranton, the author of the
article, is the daughter of the well
known physician, Dr. G. WV.
Scranton:
A bright August morning, a spir
ited span of bays, an open car
riage, a trio of happy girls-a dash
and away from Youngsville to La
fayette ! The roads are dusty !
You should see the hats and
dresses, the bays and harness when
we drew rein in front of a hand
some, unpretending residence, near
the entrance of the town.
The ride was short and pleasant,
in spite of the dust I Girls are easily
amused and each darkey child at its
door waving its chubby hand and
smiling or dashing out to cheer us,
furnished matter for laughter !
-reat wagons passed us laden with
cotton; the negro hands, half hid
den in its snow, peeped at us with a
pleasant smile and gracious nod.
They are a happy, devoted race.

\Ve spent a whole week at Lafa
yette, an aristocratic inland town,
too dignified to grow fast and yet
too proud to lose promnence in
trade. It stands about a junction
of the Southern Pacific Railroad
and is named from the young mar
quis Lafayette. who was so gener
ous to America in her time of need.
Like its name-rake, the town may
some clay come into prominence
and become the right-hand of its
State. Who knows ? Until then we
can enjoy her green lanes and
broad streets, and believe she has
no equal this side the Atlantic, in
the pleasures she secures to us, and
we are logically correct !
W\'hy the town of Lafayette
moved up from the banks of the
Vermilion we are at a loss to say,
but that it has moved is a fact
patent to those long acquainted
with the town and its ways.
It may be Vermilion and itself
did not "get along well" together,
the river may have encroached on
the rights of the town, and like the
dwelle on the banks of a river in
old xon times, they became
riv
heir disagreement, whatever the
origin, must be interesting to the
people long acquainted with both.
To us, comparatively new arrivals,
it is a subject of great curiosity!
which so far has not been satisfied.
The Catholic Church at Lafa
yette promises to rank among the
prettiest of the parish. The park,
too, with its accommodations is
well kept. Here in the shade of
great trees, children enjoy fresh air
at noon, old people in the early
evening and young people in the
magic tints of artificial lights.
The limitless woods on the out
skirts of the town are resorts for
holidays and picnics, and are al
ways cool and pleasant. One week
of pleasure here and then-home
gcain-sh~ortly after-back to
school.

Mr. Editor: We have not sent
you anythig for Tms GAZErTrTI in
some time, but that does not go to
prove that we have forsaken it. It's
visits are most welcome. In each
issue we find intelhligence of interest
in the local and personal columns,
at least. A few dlots from here will
adtl to the variety of the paper's
contents, if not to its interest.
Our town is still improving. Mr.
MI. Bell's mnagnificent brick store on
Main street is completed, and it is
chock full of goods, and thile clerks
are all busy. Mr. Schwan has a
tremendous fran'u store house on
Main street well under way. Our
city councilmen have recently
enacted a law prohibiting the con
struction of wooden buildings on
Main street in the fiuture.
Mr. O. 1.. Alpha, the ex-editor of
the Vindicator, has bought out the
Voice at Morgan City. The Voice,
it. Bought a dead Voice. A
strange purchase. We have not
learned whether he intends to bring
his Voice here, or endeavor to bring
it to life where it is.
Sugar making is near at hand, and
there is an increase of stir and rack
et in consequence. Strangers, en
gineers, chemists, common hands,
Sambo with his mules and wagons,
are all here and all have a "move
on them."
Our merchants seem to be doing
well. Plenty of competition be
tween our grocers. They will load
up a basket for a trifle, and then
pile up lagniappe on top.
We have had quite an improve
ment in town of late in the way of
a market. A gentleman from New
Orleans has opened up. Before
our markets only kept beef, but the
new one not only keeps beef,_but
pork, fish, flesh and fowl. The
most fastidious epicure can now be
gratified.
The times are said to be hard,
yet our young people will wed. On
Thursday night, the loth inst., we
united two couples: Mr. James A.
Peterman and Miss Helen E. Mc
Kerall, and Mr. Clinton Benoit and
Miss Daisy Johnston. Any of the
Lafayette young people getting off?

Charles de Busscil.
Charles de Busseil, the old gen
tleman who lived on Mr. Lom
bard's place, died Thursday eve
ning at the age of about 65 years.
"'Pere Charles," as he was familiarly
called, was born in Paris of a noted
French family. He had in his
possession documents showing his
high birth, and had he lived in
France he would have been a
"Count," but having spent most
of his life in America, this title of
nobility was known to only a few
friends. He was a well-educated
man and a painter of great ability,
several stage-curtains in different
parts of the State bearing testimony
to his skill and taste. He was a
quiet, unassuming man and always
extremely modest. He lived alone
in the old Creighton house on Mr.
Lombard's place and seldom came
to town; he delighted in solitude
and seemed to enjoy the company
of his favorite dogs more than
contact with the world. Borr, and
reared in affluence in the gayest city
of the world, little he cared for its
pleasures and vanities. He pro
fessed no religious belief, and vis
ited no churches. Before dying
he expressed the desire to be buried
under a large oak on the banks of the
Vermilion. All who knew "Pere
Charles" will sorrow for his death,
as he was a g od, kind old man.
Peace to his ashes.
Again we advise the rice planter
of Calcasieu not too be in too great
haste in disposing of this year's
crop. The acreage this .year is
larger than last and the yield great
er and or better quality, yet it will
not be sufficient to supply the home
demand, and foreign rice will have
to be resorted to as usual to make
up the deficit. The foreign crop is
short this year and there will be less
for export than usual. This b-ing
the case, it would seem that the
farmers are, or should be, masters
of the situation, provided they act
upon business principles and feed
the market as the market de
mands, instead of rushin.: in the en
tire crop at the earliest possible
moment andt breaking down the
mnarket to such an extent that it will
not recover for the entire season.
l'he rice producers here have only
to side their time with patience and
they will get full value for ther
product. -Lake Charles Comrner

A Muddle.
On Tuesday last, lion. G. L.
Dupre, as attorney of Wm. Oakley
et al., filed a suit which attracted a
great deal of attention, and, if Mr.
Dupre's contentions are correct, it
may be far reaching ira its effects.
It may be remembered that on
the 27th of August, 2895, the Po
lice Jury re-districted the parish of
St. Landry. In doing so, it cut
off a slice of the Opelousas ward
and erected a justice of the peace
ward of the Bellevue district, serv
ing it from the Opelousas ward.
On M ,nday Oakley and his asso
ciates applied to be registered as
voters of the Ist, or Opelousas
ward. Registrar Swords, in con
formity with the re-districting above
referred to, insisted on registering
these parties as residents of the new
justice of the peace ward. They
demurred and applied for a writ of
mantdamus to compel registration
as voters of the Opelousas ward as
it is existed prior to August 27th.
Judge Perrault granted the alterna
tive mandamus, making it return
able on the ioth inst.
The relators contend that the
office of justice of the peace is con
stitutional and that the action of
the Police Jury is ultra vires uncon
stitutional, illegal and void. It is
also alleged that the Police Jury
neglected to act in time in comply
ing with a speciel act of the Legis
lature. If Mr. Dupre's legal posi
tion is correct, then the Police Jury,
in re-districting the parish, has suc
ceeded in muddling matters co,.sid
