th This Sarsaparilla is a combination of
o- vegetable alteratives--Stillingia, Man
drake, Yellow Dock -with the Iodides
of Potassium and Iron, and is the most
0' eficacious medicine yet known for
r the diseases it is intended to cure.
4 Its ingredients are soslfilfully com
a- bined, that the full alterative effect of
to each is assured, and while it isaso Miild
e- as to be harmless even to'cbidlreni it is
still so effectual as to purge odt from the
system those impurities and corruptions
,d which develop into loathsome diseaeo..ý
Lit The reputation it enjoys is derived
or from its cures, ahd the confidence which
ps prominent physicians .all over the coun
1 try repose in it, prove their experience
of its usefulness. .
3. Certificates attesting its irtues have
fe accumulated, and are constantly being
it received, and as many of these ays jore
a publicly known, they furnish conviniit g
*. evidence of the superiority of this Sar
o, saparilla over every other aiterative
medicine. So generally is its superi
ority to any other medicine known, that
we need do no more than to fissure the
public that the best qualities it has ever
possessed are strictly maintained.
