Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etablepreparation, made chiefly from
the naive herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the u3h of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
"What is the cause of'the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERS ." Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
rator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Via
soar BITrRas in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Dn. WALx
PR'T VIf OAR IrTTaes are Aperient, Dia

companied by extensive derange
meats of the stomach and liver, anl:
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful infllunce upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to D)n. J. WALKEr 'S VINEaAR

the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver.

Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
