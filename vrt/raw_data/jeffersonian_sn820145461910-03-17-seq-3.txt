—==THE=
SUNNY SOUTH BROTHERHOOD
— By DADDY JIM
“If this comic-opera republic is
ever to be rescued from the corrupt
oligarchy that now owns it, body and
soul, it will be succored and made
decent and restored to its rightful
owners, the people, by publications
of The Jeffersonian stamp”.
That was written by “Uncle Char
lie”, who is Charles Noel Douglas,
the Associate Editor of Comfort and
chief of Comfort’s League of Cousins.
Shut-ins of the South.
In his letter to the Jeffs, Mr. Doug
las says:
“Comfort has thousands upon
thousands of readers in Georgia. I
have a Sunshine League of nearly
40,000 members, and the amount of
good we do passes all belief. Most
of the helpless, bedridden shut-ins
are in the South, and particularly in
the Southeast. We distribute a great
many wheel-chairs (costly articles,
too, by the way). We have sent
numbers of them into North and
South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky,
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ten
nessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Ar
kansas, etc. North Carolina seems to
be full of helpless, incurable invalids.
I sent a wheel-chair to a woman in
Arkansas, who had been buried in
the recesses of a log cabin, and had
not seen the sun for nineteen years.”
Home Versus Heathen.
“Lots of good church people would
call on her, but they were all too busy
buying silk kimonas for the heathen,
to do anything for their sick brothers
and sisters at home. The amount of
..sickness and suffering that exists in
this country, and especially in dear
old Dixie, passes belief. I believe we
are about the only people who ever
get any real money for these invalids.
Letters, sympathy and tracts, espe
cially tracts, are what other organi
zations hand out when these cases
come to their notice”.
Breadless Sympathy.
“I have been bedridden myself for
thirteen years, so I have no use for
breadless sympathy. Church people
send their money abroad, and dope
out tracts to the incurable sick at
home. Any time The Jeffersonian
would like a list of the poor souls
who need help right in its own State,
I’ll gladly supply it. In March Com
fort you’ll find I have made another
appeal for a poor sick Georgia boy.
These appeals seldom bring less than
a hundred dollars for the person ap
pealed for, and sometimes the
amount is much larger.”
The Samaritan and Others.
The point is this: Here is a bed
ridden man who lives in Brooklyn,
New York, and edits a paper which
is published in Augusta, Maine, help
ing to take care of our sick and help
less folks in the Sunny South, while
we pass by on the other side to drop
our dimes and dollars on the silver
plates of a wealthy and fashionable
organization, to be spent in the pur
chase of “little Doras”, from their
African parents.
Unto the Least of These.
But we are thinking. The younger
folks are being stirred. Here is a
letter from Arling Tootle, twelve
years old, who lives at Glennville,
Ga., and is a worthy member of the
“Post-Card Club”:
“I want to hear from every little
boy and girl who will help the little
sick boys and girls. I think that we
could all throw in a nickel, and get
Daddy Jim to give us a button; and
when we have our buttons, throw in
as much as we will, and help the lit
tle crippled members of our club. I
think God will bless us. Daddy Jim
could get us a club button, the same
as Uncle Charlie, and we could have
these laws to go by: (1) Care for
our sick and crippled members. (2)
Love each other. (3) Do not curse
or beat dumb animals. Dear cous
ins, let me hear soon, and let the
members that are crippled apply to
me for help, also for membership.
That piece headed “This Should
Make Us all Ashamed of Ourselves”
made me go to thinking.”
A Word From Montana.
Let us pass Arling Tootle’s sug
gestion, for the present, and take
another letter from an old sub
scriber in Montana:
“I am sending you an article from
Comfort. lam aware that your at
tention has been called to it, as I
have seen your editorial in The Jef
fersonian, but I thought perhaps you
had not seen the article in full. This
Uncle Charlie conducts the depart
ment of Comfort known as the
“League of Cousins”. The members
write to Uncle Charlie, and he an
swers them, and, by the way, I think
he is one of the most lucid writers of
the day. I understand he is a shut
in himself. Notice the list of shut
ins for February. Don’t you think
it would be a good scheme if the list
could be brought to the notice of
our missionary fanatics, and see if
they would shed as many tears over
it as they do over “Dear Little Dora”
in Africa. About such a list goes out
every month, and it seems to me it
would be a good place for our be
nevolent millionaires to scatter some
of their benevolence. H. Dillabugh,
Missoula, Montana.”
One more letter, and that is the
one referred to by Uncle Charlie.
Then we will come to a practical
suggestion.
An Appeal From Georgia.
Dear Uncle Charlie and Cousins:—l
have been a reader of Comfort for sev
eral years, and have noticed that the
cousins often help those who are
weighed down by disease and adversi
ty, hence I come to you, in the hope
that you can put the power in my
hands, with which to fight life’s un
even battles. I am twenty-six years
old. and have been crippled twenty
years by inflammatory rheumatism.
Have never been able to do a day’s
work, and haven’t walked a step for
fourteen years. Aside from being
hopelessly crippled for life, my health
is usually good, but was down five
months of the present year, with
grippe, chills and fever.
I have picked up a little education
the best way I could. Am obliged to
write with my left hand—my right be
ing so drawn it’s impossible to use it
for that purpose. I have tried very
hard to make my own living at vari
ous things, but failure has usually at
tended my efforts.
My parents are now getting too old
to work for me, and besides the au
thorities of my home county, which is
Douglas, have absolutely refused to
give me any financial assistance, and
have suggested that I go to the poor
house, the thought of which is very
detestable to me, and has induced me
to appeal to the cousins’ generosity
for aid, as a last resort. Thanking you
in advance for any aid you may ren
der me in my affliction and asking
God to bless you all, I am sincerely
your friend, JOHN H. KEATON.
Douglasville, R. D. 3, Ga.
Uncle Charlie’s Comment.
“John’s letter is a sad one indeed.
All but six years of his life he has
been crippled. In spite of his afflic
tion he writes splendidly and can put
to shame many who have had far
greater advantages than he. If this
poor fellow is sent to the poorhouse
it will at least cost the county three
dollars a week to keep him. Would
it not be far more humane and Christ
like to help support these poor souls
in their own homes where they can
have the loving care of those near and
dear to them than drag them into
i tiese wretched county institutions
where if there is any nursing at all it
is done by other unfortunates who
usually have enough troubles of their
own and have little desire to lift the
burdens of others. There is still a
good deal of brutality and inhumanity
in our treatment of the Unfortunate
sick. We should not only have old
age pensions, but those who are in
curably ill with no chance of recovery
should also be pensioned, and the pen
sion in their case should be double
XSlje 3effcrsonian
that of those in health, for the needs
of the sick are always greater than
the needs of the well. If you can send
any sunshine into the life of this poor
brother of yours or suggest to him any
way by which he may be able to earn
sufficient to keep him out of the poor
house, I shall be indeed graWful.”
Another Case in Georgia.
“Dear Mr. Watson: —I believe you
are the poor man’s friend. I want
to state our condition to you, and see
if your readers will kindly lend a
helping hand to us. My husband has
rheumatism, and has been helpless
three years. We have two children,
and live in a rented house. I take in
all the washing lam able to do. I
have to take the children with me,
for if I should leave them in the
house, and they were to fall in the
fire, their papa couldn’t pull them
out. The town (Cornelia) give us
$3.00 per month, and the county
gives $5,000, but everything is so
high we don’t have much to get medi
cine, after all I can do. My husband’s
sister lives with us, and her health is
very poor, and it is so hard for us to
wash all day and be up nearly every
hour through the night. I hope all
Christian people will remember us in
prayer.—Mrs. John S. Sosbee.”
Cornelia, Ga.
It would be interesting to know
exactly how much the various church
organizations in Cornelia contributed
to the cause of missions in foreign
lands during the last twelve months.
The Practical Side.
It’s no good complaining of things
that are wrong, unless you have some
plan to set them right. Let us con
sider Uncle Charlie’s League and
Arling Tootle’s suggestion of a chil
dren’s club. Both are practical.
Both will give help where help is
sadly needed. Both are necessary
corollaries of Mr. Watson’s articles
on Foreign Missions. They follow
his statements of facts, like the Q. E.
D. at the end of a problem in Euclid.
We will, therefore, proceed to put
our Jeffersonian Home Missions
movement into definite form.
The Brotherhood.
If a dozen good men or women
will write to the Jeffersonians, say
ing that they will help to organize
“The Sunny South Brotherhood”, the
thing is done. We will write to Un
cle Charlie to send us that list of all
who need help in the South. We will
call on our readers to report to the
Brotherhood all deserving cases. We
will bring pressure to bear on all
church and charitable organizations
to care first for their sick and help
less ones at home. In every town
and village in the South we will try
to find some one to look after this
home mission work. There shall be
no denominational differences. We
will work with all who will work
with us —Sisters of Qharity, Salva
tion lassies, Baptists, Methodists,
Episcopalians, Presbyterians—Chari
ty’s cloak is wide enough for us all.
Write at Once.
Don’t write long letters. Just say:
“I wish to become a working mem
ber of the Sunny South Brother
hood”; write your name and address
plainly, and mail your letter to the
Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga. Strike
while the iron’s hot. Next week we
will outline our plans.
