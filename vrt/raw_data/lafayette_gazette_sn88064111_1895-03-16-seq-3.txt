Coming to th16 Fronk.
The Gazette's staunch triend,
"Loule" is slowly but surely Coiring
to the front. His last victory in
the fisti c arena was won last Mon
day after a hard struggle for suprem
acy. Loule's adversary was Cama
ra, the fruit vendor, but after the
fight he looked more like a man
engaged in taming wildcats than
one who pursues the peaceful occu
pation of selling "o-ranges and ba
haneys." Fortunately friends in
terfered, separated the fighters and
put a stop to hostilities.
A Company of Fakes.
Duncan Clark's aggregation of
blooming blondes and blushing
brunettes showed heie last Sunday
to a small and appreciative audience
composed mostly of bald-heads
and run-a-way husbands. The show
was fully up to expectations but
the ekpections were not very high.
Briefly, it was about the worst
crowd of fakes that ever visited La
fayette and did not have a si ngle
redeeming feature. An additional
price of 25 cents was charged for the
"concert" which was a repetition of
the first entertainment. As one
gentleman remarked: "They sim
ply put their hands in our pockets
and helped themselves and we tame
ly sibmitted to it.".
Writing Up the Coun ntry.
H. S. Kneedler, a most agredble
gentleman, was in Lafayette Monday
engaged in writing up this country
for the Southern Pacific Company.
Mr. Kneedler informed a Gazette
reporter that the -ork which thV.
company has undertaken is of great
magnitude and promises to acconi
plish much in the way of adver
tising the many advantages of the
country along the Southern Pacific
road. Mr. Kneedler's dcscriptions
of this section will be interspersed
with historical facts.
Twcunty-nine Years a Teacher.
Mrs. Homer Bailey closed her
school last Friday after teaching
during twenty-nine years. This es
timable lady has spent nearly three
decades in the school-room teach
ing the "young idea how to shoot,"
and at no time during this long
period has she failed to merit the
esteem of both pupil and parent.
Among our townsmenh who have al
ready attained success in the busi
ness world and in the learned profess
ions are some of Mrs. Bailey's
early pupils, who have received the
benefit of her splendid training.
The retirement of Mrs. Bailey from
the school-room, we are sorry to
say. is due to an enfeebled state of
her health, which TIhe Gazette
hopes will only be temporary.
A Briass Band.
The Gazette is pleased to an
nounce that the young men of La
fayette have organized a brass band.
Mr. Henry Gerac, who is a very
competent teacher, has volunteered
his services and the band will soon
begin practicing. The following
are the members: T. 1M. Eves, J.
VW. Eves, E. T. McBride, Henry
Judice, C. T'. Bienvenu, Lucius
Prudhomme, Rene Horaist, Roaul
Pellerin, Simon Boudreaux, Henry
Fontenot, Ignatius Martin, Albert
Coumes, Willis Eves, Sidney Ro
mero, Albert Robichaudi Gilbert

Ducote, J. v. Johnson and Louis

The Levee Troubles.
The latest news from New Or
leans is that the governor has or
dered out the militia to protect the
laborers on the levee. The gover
nor came to this conclusion after
thoroughly considering every phase
of the situation. Now that the mili
tary boys are on the levee ample pro-
tection will be afforded every niin,
white or black, who desires to
work. It is to be hoped thit this
step of the authorities will put an
end to the cowardly shedding of
innOCent blood:
Last Fesday in the forenoon' a
r Gazette ;ep6eteir in tothpany With a
railroad Bonductor, visited "Hotel
I de Btlihi~ the fAmous hobo resort of
kLafayette, or bather what is left of
g it. The spot where once stood the
, rough shed that sheltered so many
I homeless wanderers is now marked
t by the remnant of an old brick
s press, a te* pieces of tron and
r other things which these nomadic
e people could not use for fuel.
- There is probably not a single
t genuine h'o6'o, the real article who
is an honor to the "profesh," who
has not shared the hospitality of
this celebrated hostelry. And no
wonder that it is famed at home
and abroad. It is known from the
lakes to the gulf and front ocean to
ocean. Some time ago one of
these migratory Coxeyites stated to
bne of the railroad boys that he
had heard of the "brick-yard"
while in Chicago tiid another
Knight of Perpetual Rest said that
he had heard of it beyond the con
fines of Uncle Sam away down in
old Mexico. It is undoubtedly one
of the best known institutions in
t this parish and nothing has brought
t Lafayette more prominently before
the nation than thii modest home
of the hobo cohorts. Though it
has no register it is estimated that
I in recent years the number of tran
sient guests alone has been forty
per day. Its registry would easily
surpass those of the Royal and
Grunewald combined. Among its
ruins may be seen four or five hun
dred cans used as cooking uten
sils, tons of burned coal
and enough cane-trash to fur
nish fuel for a sugar-mill a whole
month. Other articles familiar to
the life of the regulation hobo may
be found scattered about the de
pleted lot. Dead dogs have been
left to rot there by cruel-hearted
persons and the once glorious spot
has lost its fonimer picturesqueness
and the only thing that is left to tell
the tale of its lost prestige is the
old brick-press which rises majes
tically above the glimmering land
scape of Hoboville.
S
An Important Decision.
During the last term of the Dis
trict Court Judge Allen decided an
important question to the farmers.
It was a case where a party had
been working on halres on a plan
tation several years, cultivating
during that time certaii portions
of the field. At the beginning of a
year the farmnner employed another
party and gave for cultivation,
without the consent and against the
protest of the first party, a portion
of the land cultivated by the latter
the previous years, whereupon he
left the place and brought suit
against the farmer fci- payment for
work already done and for damages
for violation of the contract.
The judge decided that plaintiff
could not recover, because he was
only a laborer and the farmer had
the sole and exclusive control of
his farm, and that having aban
doned his work withotit legal cause,
the laborer could get nothing for
work already done.

Rather Mixed.
We have been requested to explain with
relation to the complaint receitly made by
our local contemporary that the present rates
charged for telephoning are excessive, that
the example submitted in support of the com
plaint is not a fair one. A charge of "25
cents" is madre not to send *5ix wcirds" only
by telephone from 'Lafayette to St. Martin
ville, but for the use of the teliphone for not
more than 5 minutes. This it i ninch more
reasonable rate than is charged for sending a
telegram between the two poitts, viz: 60
cents for to words or less, one way, and, if
an answer is required, 60 cents additional
for the second telegram. In the case of tele
phoning a message may be easily sent and a
reply received within the five minutes, and,
b'sides the message need not lbe liniited to
ten words, and the fee charged covers tlhe
cost of both the message Snd answer. On
the other hand if no anwser be required the
telephone is again much the more advan
tageous medium of communication, for not
only is the chmrge between the two points
named t5 cents less than for a telegram of
1o words but also the patron is entitled to
the service of the telephone for a space of five
minutes, enabling the speaker to send quite
a lengthy message if occasion shouldt de
mand it. WVhet all the facts as well as the
naiture of the telephone service are taken in
to consideration, then, the tariff of rittes es
tablished biy the t'lephone are not as high
as'they might aplidfir to be at a isuperficial
glance. This explanation is imade by re
quest and is done in justice to the T"che &
Vermillion Telephone Liid.--Advertiser.
To begin with wd till say that
the Advertiser's "local comporary"
has made no such statenient. The
Gazette complainedhof the exhorbi
tant charges of sez'enlty-/iie cents
for a message df six *ords from
thid Sldce to St. Martinville. T'his

Spring has come and with it the
pretty red songsters.
Oh, but wont it be pleasant when
the rain ceases for a spell.
No other prairie town can boast
of as many changes ti public school
teachers during one term as booming
little Duson can.- Robert Cunning
ham. of Rayne, is at present pro
fessor of our school. We have no
advice to give you, professor, but
in a modest way wish you great
success.
Measles are visiting the young
ladies of Duson, but We hope soon
to see them exterminated and the
health and beauty returned to our
fair ones.
We hear the road overseer has
been howling because. thete are new
roads to make. We do not censure
him; these annual surveys are not
so profitable as some people ima
gine.
Shade trees are being planted on
our side walks. Push forward, gen

We believe in public enterprise, es
pecialy when it has a tendency td
beautify our prairie town.
Mrs. Ophelia Foreman was called
to Rayne one day last week to the
bedside of her sick sister, Mrs. Gus

Mr. Ed Smith, of Rayne, was a
recent visitor to Duson.
Mr. Clarence Avant comtemplates
building soon. We presume he is
getting tired of single blessedness.
Messrs. Floyd and Servat made a
business trip to Lafayette Tuesday.
Miss Ophelia Guidry, of Isle Deg

one of the Duson belles, Miss Ne
dia Boudreaux.
Mrs. S. L. Bailey spent the past
week at Duson the guest of her son
and daughter Mr. and Mrs. W. G.
Baily. Grandma returned to La

home of her lately married daughter,
Mrs. Serrett.
A little visitor arrived last week
at the residence of W. W. Posts.
It proved to be an hier and de

Then and 1ovW.
There was a time when he who would
keep informed of the progress of knowledge,
the record of discovery and invention, and
the currents of human, thought, could and
indeed must rely chiefly if not wholly upon
books. That day has passed. Bfooks we
must still read, as the crystallization and
permanent embodiment of human thought
and knowledge. But to-day it is the news
ipaper, the magazine, the periodical review,
upon which we must chiefly depend if we
would follow closely the intellectual move
meet of the day. And now a new difficulty
has arisen. This newspaper and periodical
literature has become so multitudinous and
bulky as to be a heavy burden to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure atid inclination to read widely
is often unalI to get access to the current
publications. Especially in the smaller
cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by
the clergymian, the teacher, the lawyer, the
physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and. tl~ cultuu.rded and thoughtful
practical literary question is: With allI
these and many other classes of persons the

An Open Letter to ICaIlie.
George W. Pepperell is very ac
tive it. political literature this year,
and his series of Open Letter to
prominent political leaders in the
Arena is attractiing  tiitiiti atten
tion and creating as much curiosity
as an)y thing that has iijpeared in
periodical literature since the fa
mous Arthur Richmond letters,
which set the political world by the
ears and all heads a-wagging some
years ago. George W- Pepperell
has the same acuteness of perfecs
tion, the same directness and deft
ness of attack, the same long mem
ory of political history inside and
out, and the same mastery of all
the facts of'the important legislatioii
of this country during the last
twenty-five years. In the March
Arena George W. Pepperell pre
sumably one of .the ancient New
England Pepperell family which led
the storming of Louisburg, addresses
an open letter to Secretary Carlisle,
and he makes fairly breezy reading
for all who love polemics. The
writer, whoever he is, is a politician
to his finger tips and knows the ins
and outs of American men and
parties like an oracle.
A Card of Thanks.
Mrs. Bailey, in closing her school,
desires to express her gratitude and
thanks to those who so kindly pat
ronized her during 29 long years.
Their many evidences of friehd
