f?' We record it to Iiis credit
that Mr. J. H, Sullivan who holds
an appointment for the unexpired
term of Judge C. V. Ledeoux as
Parish Judge and who was a can
didate for that position in opposi
tion to Judge Daigre at the last
election, said oil the bench on Wed
nesday to the members of the bar,
that ho knew lie had not been elect
ed and that if the Returning Board
should count him in he would not
be conn ted in and would return any
commission they might send him.
This is the proper spirit and is the
only course an honest man could
take. We have had so much to do
with dishonest ones that we were
u little surprised to hear this from
Judge Sullivan. Thé other defeat
ed candidates had better come to
the same conclusion, though from
a different motive thau the honest
one that actuated Judge Sullivan*
T he C oli-ax P risonous —We pub
lished last week a letter from Cnpt.
Jeffries on the subject of raising
funds to defray the expenses of Coun
sel in the case of the Coifax prison
ers, and we publish this week Anoth
er pariotic letter from Gecl. G.
Mason Graham on the-same subject.
Wo are at a loss to suggest any
practical means of meeting the necesi
ties of the case. A publie meeting
doesjnot seem to be necessary nor
indeed the proper method. A much
more (ffective way of raisin« funds
would be for the ladies to take hold
of the matter, and to make personal
epplications to all our citizen we,
have no doubt „that every one will j
respond liberally. Business or oth
er reasons might keep many from a
public meeting who would be reach
ed by a personal appeal. The Thes
pians will doubtless give another en
tertainment for their benefit.
Will the ladies go around with
subscription lists ?
tS^We invite attention to the no
tice of Mr. IT. : Wecms who desires
an engagement- for next year as
manager of a plantation. Tie enn
bring with him four or five good
hands and planters in need oF a
manager will do well to see Mr.

' THE LABOR QUESTION.
The time is rapidly approaching
now when our planters will make
their contracts for another year,
and the subject is tight now one of
peculiar interest. Without being
a practical farmer and being ut
terly ignorant of the modus operandi
of planting and making crops ol
cotton, sugar and corn, wo, have
our ideas upon the question of la
bor and propose to give them for
what they are worth only.
The system generally employed
here is to luruish the land, cabins
for the laborer and his family,
wood and everything needful for
their comfort and convenience ex
cept Kupplies, and to exact in re
turn one fourth of the crop, or
when the planter furnishes work
stock, and feeds it and supplies the
plaritation'implemeuts, to get one
half the crop. The principal ob
jection to this system is that all the
risk is on one side and on the gain
on the other. The planter risks
the use of his land upon which lie
alone pays a tax of five percent;
in which he has a capital invested
which ought to yield h'irn at least
ten per cent clear of expenses, and
the wear and tear of his stock and
implements which is equal to one
seventh of their value. The laborer
without any capital; without the
means of sustenance and dependent
on some one to furnish hiiu upon
the faith of his crop, with nothing
iu the world but his muscle and
Skin which fits him for labor and
nothing else, risks only that.labor,
find js provided a home for himself
and fatnily and support for them
while the risk is pending. This is
the financial aspect of the case.
In a legîîl sense, such a contract
providing for a division of the prof
its and not providing for a division
of losses is a unilateral contract of
partnership which leaves the plan
ter without his rights under the
he have a judicial contest with his
laborers, to sue for a settlement of
the partnership affairs. It makes
; the laborer independent of the plan
fer, and deprives him of the abso
]ute right of control which ought to
j vested in every proprietor who
us that for next yeai it would be
p rae ticable to divide the two sys
employs labor. The system is an
anomalous one, and we doubt it
there is any where else any in
stance of any similar one. The
universal rule of em ploying labor is
for wages, fixed, certain and deter
mined in any event. Why we of
the South should adopt a different
method can not be accounted for
upon any reasonable hypothesis
and that we have and are doing so,
is to be attributed alone to the fact
that the laborer demanded that
much and we yielded.
It may not be pissible to change
the system all at once, but we
should like to see our planters get
back to the plan of paying wages
as soon as possible. It appears to
ced portion () }j
e eighth. The
j t{?ms an( j IU ake such contracts asii^
j that the laborer is to have so much, j
j sa y j ia if wages or about 87 50 per
m0Iltll? and a reduC( 1

| upon the laborer, and if he failed I
injto work his wages could be docked

to pay for time lost. Besides his!:,

wages the laborer would be inter
ested in making good crops by rea-|8l
son of his share therein and this!
would act as a sufficient stimulus!
for his

other hand, the certainty of getting;
something for his labor, regardless j
I
of caterpillars, or other
ses of failure and it.would moreover
give him the wherewithal to buy
the greater portion of his supplies
for cash, aud at a much lower fig
ure thau he now pays for them on
credit.
We hope to see every planter in
the parish belong to the Patro s of
Husbandry and in such a union it
is possible to control the whole
subject of labor. The negroes al
ways have a perfect uuderstand
ing among themselves through
their churches aud clnbs and it is
strange that the white people have
to learn practical sense from them
laud that then they will not need
the lessuus so easily learned and ot:81

pounds»
Deduct 313 pounds for tbe tilling**
at 38^ pounds to the bale, leaves
5038 pounds clean ginned cotton.
Surprised at the yield from so
a piece of ground, jind that
heavy bermuda sod, 1 measured
^ accurately, and found it to bo
five acres, three rods and sixteen »
poles. 1). J. GRAHAM. '.

think that my brother could forget
tue," cried Charlotte, large tears i
coursing down her cheeks, "when I
have loved bim so, and longed for
pur meeting again 1" ? . ; . ;. Ji;
"It is because yoa are obanged so
much that he does not remember
you ; yeu were very little iwhen you
parted," replied her an am ma*- "ïou

know and love each other as bo
fore."
"But it will always' grief erne ta

"Did you never forget a ftien^}?'*!
"I think not, mamma." ' * v ' v
"Who is your best friend—tho

for you ?"
"Jesus Christ, the Saviour."
"Did you never forget him ?"
"O yes f often." . n .1 .
"And yet he loves yon far more
than you love your brother. How
your forgetfulness must grieve him !"
