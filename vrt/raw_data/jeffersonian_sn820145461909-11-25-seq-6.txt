THE HOME FIELD IS CALLING US.
Dear Sir: —I have put off writing
to you for a long time, and I will
now go at my task.
I am twenty-five years old and a
Populist. Have read your papers for
the last year, and think they are fine
and will read them as long as I am
able to get them. I inclose money
order to cover renewals.
Your articles on Foreign Missions
are good. I would like to see every
Christian minister fight the devil just
half as much the next six months as
they have fought you the last six
months, for they fight you more than
they do the devil.
I have just read President Mc-
Lean’s letter, and I am surprised at
him. If a few* of the farmers here
could get one thousand dollars a year,
they would think they were rich.
What is he thinking about? Good
God, come down here, Mr. McLean,
into Carroll county, Georgia, in this
boasted land of liberty, and see for
yourself that there is not a farmer
in this settlement that handles one
thousand dollars. None of them are
out of debt. Come and see men that
can not send their children to school
because they are not able to clothe
them; come and see widow’s with a
flock of little children for whom they
can hardly get enough food to satisfy
the hunger that gnaws at their stom
achs like the demons of hell. Come,
you religious fanatics, and see the
so-called schoolhouses that are rot
ting down and are not fit for a dog
to stay in; come and see the shanties
that are called churches, and the lit
tle no-account dwellings that we live
in, and the poverty that is here.
Oh, by the splendor of God, you
do not have to trot twelve thousand
miles to find something to do! Will
you deny that?
Come down here, and you will see
a man cheat his neighbor out of five
dollars in false weighing and give it
to foreign missions, and you will
hear the minister call him brother,
and shake his hand, —but he will
hardly speak to a man that can’t con
tribute.
1 have made a few statements. I
don’t ask any one to take my word
for them. The proof is here. I live
on a rented farm, work on halves,
and I am in debt. I have lived on
the farm all of my life, and I know
what I am saying. I have heard
preachers say that if a man didn’t
give to foreign missions he was not a
Christian. Respectfully,
R. C. PHILLIPS.

THIS ONE IS EASILY SATISFIED.
Dear Sir:—l heartily agree with
you in what you say of the Federal
Courts, but we must go slow. The
Socialists are good men, but they
scare the great middle class, and no
party can hope to succeed unless it
can get the active support of the
great middle aclss. We must work
and wait. We can carry the next
Presidential election with a good
platform, but not as Socialists. We
must make a platform that will suit
the common people and middle class
both. We must throw out the negro
vote, favor white women’s suffrage,
protect home labor and products, re
duce taxation on working people
twenty-five to seventy five per cent.,
favor old age pensions for both men
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
and women, reduce all public salaries
twenty-five to seventy-five per cent.,
reform all courts, reduce the number
of officeholders in the Government
service to one fourth of the present
number, declare against imperialism,
favor an income tax, stop foreign im
migration and the importation of for
eign goods—as we want no more
Clevelandism.
These are some of the things I
want to see in our next platform, and
we ought to also declare against the
liquor traffic. But above all things,
we want to guard against any sort of
fusion. If reformers want reform,
they must come to us.
I received a letter from Mr. Gom
pers a short while ago, and I feel
sure the Federation of Labor and,
in fact, all good citizens will be in
our ranks soon. I will send you my
subscription as soon as I can.
Hoping for success to you and our
cause, I remain
Very respectfully,
J. F. LEONARD.
Bell River, Illinois.
(Some day when Brother Leonard
is at leisure and is inclined to write,
I hope he will mention a few hun
dred of the other things that he
wants in the platform. T. E. W.)
WHITE SUPREMACY AND DIRECT
VOTE.
Dear Sir: —Inclosed you will find
M. O. for $2.00 for renewal to the
Jeffersonians.
I am praying and working for the
reforms and principles so ably and
strenuously advocated by the Jeffer
sonians.
I have just finished reading let
ter from “Legislator” (Sylvester,
Ga.), issue of November 4th, and
heartily indorse it; but I would
amend it by declaring—
First. We, the party (no matter
what the name may be), declare for
white supremacy, the election of all
officers from President down, or con
stable up, by a direct vote of the
people.
Yours truly,
J. B. ENOCHS.

SECTARIANISM AN ABOMINATION
The Jeffs:—ln replying to a sister
in regard to joining the church and
living a Christian life. She bewails
iny lost condition and is praying that
I may be converted and join the
church. She thinks that the fact
that I am not a member of the church
is prima facie evidence that I am
not a Christian; that if you love the
Lord, you should love his bride, also,
which is true.
I begin my letter thus: “Know ye
not that the kingdom is within you,”
says the Acts of the Apostles. So
you see that what we call the church
is not necessarily a part of God’s
kingdom; in fact, the church in name
may be anything else but a part of
God’s creation or kingdom. In fact,
I believe that the present practice of
sectarianism is an abomination be
fore the Lord. I could not belong to
any Christian church without belong
ing to all. Further than the Apos
tles’ Creed, lam not creed-bound. I
have my views about the Bible and
am willing for the other fellow to
have his, and am willing to live and
commune with him under the same
banner, the church. The only objec
tion I have to the Baptists, or any
Jeffersonian
other denomination that I know of, is
that they do not accede their fellow
Christians this right, still they open
the doors of the church to the public
membership and restrict their be
liefs. As a matter of fact, they open
the door of one denomination or sect
of the church to which you must
conform or conscientiously withdraw
your fellowship. This I feel is un
scriptural and I can not endorse or
encourage it with my membership,
etc.
You are a sweet little Christian
woman and happy, perhaps, in your
church membership, and I would not
disturb you further than to warn you
against becoming extremely creed
bound; it is dangerous. It will make
you do selfish, mean, harsh things, as
has been the history of sectarianism
all dowm the ages. Right now, the
sectarian church organizations are
corrupt to the core, it would seem.
They are fostering a system of for
eign missions, which system is a curse
to civilization and an abomination be
fore the Lord and high heaven, it
would seem to me. The devil has
crept in.
In politics the sectarian church, in
its present organization, like in an
cient and medieval times, is always
on the corrupt side, upholding cor
ruption and crucifying reformers.
I would not undertake to excuse
myself for not being a registered
member of the church of Christ and
God as whole, for I should like to be
a member of such a church.

RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE
LOS ANGELES LIBERAL
CLUB.
Whereas, Professor Francisco Fer
rer, the Spanish educator, has been
devoting his life to the progressive
upbuilding of such institutions as
tended to broaden the ideals and
practices of his fellow 7 man; and
Whereas, Professor Francisco Fer
rer has been a constant, consistent,
deliberate upbuilder and pioneer in
lines of educational and cultural ten
dencies, opposed to sectarianism,
Catholicism, and other Christian
sects; and
Whereas, Professor Francisco Fer
rer has been the founder and moving
spirit of a system of free schools
throughout the Spanish dominion,
with the ultimate purpose of counter
acting sectarian, church-dominated
and state-regulated educational insti
tutions; and
Whereas, In consequence of these
various evidences of a large, gener
ous. brilliant, splendidly equipped
character, he has been made the
last victim of a religious big
otry which can find its par
allel only in medievalism, of a
state tyranny that finds its equal
only in Oriental regions, and of a
Jesuitical diplomacy that surpasses
the infamy of Torquemada; there
fore, be it
Resolved by the Liberal Club, of
Los Angeles, That we join with the
thoughtful, liberty-loving and pro
gressive sentiment of Europe, that is
now threatening every religious and
every tyrannical basis of government;
be it further
* Resolved, That we hereby extend
our most cordial and enthusiastic
support to all bodies that may take
action in this matter, and we pledge
our moral and financial support to
all legitimate methods that may be
used to terminate such barbarous
practices; be it further
Resolved, That a copy of these res
olutions be sent to the Spanish gov
ernment, to the Spanish embassy at
Washington, to the State Department
of the United States, and to the
press.

Copies of the foregoing resolutions

THERE WERE OTHERS THAT AT
TACKED COLLIER’S WEEKLY.
Editor Jeffersonian:—l note that
you say that only about three South
ern papers took notice of the scur
rilous attack of Collier’s last spring
upon the women of the South. Ours
is probably too small a paper to be
classed as Southern, but The Press
not only had a leading editorial de
nouncing old Collier, but it publish
ed Maple’s Rip Saw editorial on the
question, and it did the w r ork here
of cutting out Collier’s.
The Bainbridge Post also stated
that the people there were cutting out
Collier’s. There may have been nu
merous small sheets that did the
same, that editors of large papers
like your own never have time to
open.
Collier’s insinuation that the
white women of the South were
w’illing to negro outrages was the
most scurrilous insult to Southern
womanhood that we have ever been
forced to endure, and I do not see
how any self-respecting Southern
man will' let it come into his house.
But their agents are again busy in
this section, and we are so forgetful
that we will take the paper again if
we are not reminded that we are
supporting a viper to sting us.
Respectfully,
J. S. WADE, JR.,
Editor The Press.

(It gives us pleasure to be set
right. Mr. Watson reads a greater
number of country weeklies than of
city dailies. He did not, however,
see the two excellent papers men
tioned above.)
