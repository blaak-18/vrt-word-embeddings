THE VETERANS’ CORNER
THE REBEL YELL.
Dear Sir: —I have just read your
article, “Socialists and Socialism,” in
your October Magazine. It is the
grandest thing I ever read on the
subject; the wdy you treat the negro
question in the South and the trib
utes you pay to the manhood and
womanhood of the South, and the de
votion of the negro slave to his mas
ter and mistress. It makes my blood
thrill to read it: My mother’s father
was a slaveowner. Mother says she
heard him say repeatedly, after the
close of the war, that he made more
money off of free negro labor than
he ever did off of his slaves. As you
say, before the negro was freed no
one ever heard of rape, and the ne
gro would have died defending his
mistress from such hellish attacks.
But now —my God, what a change.
I hope to be in Atlanta soon, and
would be more than pleased to make
your acquaintance.
Yours truly,
G. E. TERRY.
Dallas, Texas, Oct. 8, 1909.
RESOLUTIONS OF COMMEN
DATION.
Dear Sir: —At our last regular
meeting, October third, the Adjutant
read an article from one of your
magazines on the speech of Secretary
of War Dickinson, delivered on Me
morial Day at Gettysburg, Pa., under
the headlines, “Is the South Glad It
Lost?” The old boys were highly
pleased with your seething criticism
and the manner in which you han
dled the old hypocrite.
Os all things that the true Con
federate soldier hates, it is the de
sertion of a man for the loaves and
fishes. Such a man is the most de
testable creature on earth to them
and to all decent and respectable peo
ple.
By a unanimous vote of the camp,
the Adjutant was ordered to express
to you their grateful thanks for your
manly and courageous stand for our
Southland and her brave defenders.
Thanking you again for our camp,
and for the men who wore the gray,
I am
Yours gratefully,
R. W. FERRELL,
Adjutant Pat Cleburne Camp No. 88,
U. C. V.
Cleburne, Texas.
The following resolution has been
received from Pat Cleburne Camp
No. 88, U. C. V., of Cleburne, Texas:
“Under order of the good of the
camp, the Adjutant read an article
from Thomas E. Watson's Magazine
on the speech delivered by Secretary
of War Dickinson on Memorial Day
at Gettysburg, in which he criticises
the Secretary’s speech, which this
camp heartily endorses, and on mo
tion of Comrade D. J. D. Osborn,
the Adjutant was directed to write
Mr. Watson a letter expressing to
him the thanks of this camp for the
sentiment and the courage to write
them.
' With prayer by Chaplain Menefee,
the camp closed.
R. W. FERRELL, Adjt.”
CLEBURNE AND HIS COMMAND.
Irving A. Buck, a former captain
and assistant adjutant-general to
Pat Cleburne’s division, has written
a fine history of this command and
the important part it took in the
War Between the States. He gives
a careful estimate of Cleburne the
man and of Cleburne the soldier. It
is a keen-sighted but just estimate
of circumstances, success and failure,
and the part they play in military
affairs. Captain Buck’s book is well
written and is a valuable contribu
tion to our war history. Such men
as Pat Cleburne adorn any times or
places, and this book, which has all
the minutiae of a biography, well
portrays the man and glowingly re
counts the events of the war and
Cleburne’s part in it. The book is
well printed and illustrated, and is
the output of the Neale Publishing
House, New York. (It is supplied
by the Veteran. Price, $3.00.)
Gen. Pat Cleburne.
History demonstrates the fact that
in every fight in which he engages
an Irishman is pretty sure to be in
the front ranks. This fact is well
exemplified in the story of the life
and deeds of Pat Cleburne as told by
Captain Buck in his excellent book,
“Cleburne and His Command.”
Patrick Ronayne Cleburne was the
third child of Joseph and Mary Anne
Cleburne, was born ten miles from
the city of Cork, in March, 1828. His
father, Joseph Cleburne, was a physi
cian of much eminence, a graduate
of the Royal College of Surgery in
Dublin. Alary Anne Cleburne, his
mother, was a daughter of Patrick
Ronayne, of Annebrook; so that on
both sides Patrick Cleburne was de
scended from the best old stock of
Ireland. His having been born on St.
Patrick’s Day gave him his name.
Pat Cleburne had a tutor until he
was twelve, then was sent to school.
He was fond of literature, history
and travels; but in some way failed
to acquire any taste for Latin or
Greek. He desired to follow his
father in the profession of medicine,
and as a stepping-stone to this ap
prenticed himself to a druggist pre
paratory to standing a medical ex
amination. Had chemical tastes or
pharmaceutical knowledge been the
only requirements for the diploma he
wished, Gen. Pat Cleburne would
have been a doctor and never at
tained his great celebrity in the pro
fession of arms. In his examina
tions his Greek and Latin were so
faulty that he failed to pass. This
seemed such a disgrace to the high
spirited boy that he determined his
family should never know of his hu
miliation. So he immediately enlist
ed in the 41st Regiment of Infantry
(Dublin), which he supposed was un
der marching orders for India. For
a year none of his family heard from
him at all, then only through the
son of a neighbor whose regiment
was quartered near the 41st. Cleburne
served three years with this regi
ment, then quit the army and with
one brother and sister emigrated to
America. He brought letters of in
troduction to New Orleans; but, act
ing upon his lifelong principle that
every man should depend upon him-
3effersoitian
self, he went to Cincinnati, where he
had a position in a drug-store, later
moving to Helena, Ark., where he
took his degree as a lawyer. He re
mained here until the beginning of
the war, w r hen he volunteered as a
private in the Yell Rifles.
As a citizen of Helena, Cleburne
won distinction, for he was scrupu
lously honest, enterprising and pub
lic spirited. At no time in his life
did he display more heroism than
when in 1855 Helena was stricken
with yellow fever and the public in
a panic fled in every direction. Cle
burne remained in the plague-tor
tured city, and went daily his rounds
among the fever patients, nursing
them and helping to bury the dead.
Personally Cleburne was of strik
ing appearance. He was six feet in
height, spare in build, and with
broad shoulders and erect carriage.
In his large gray eyes was ever seen
the twinkle of humor, save when
they grew black in the face of danger
or in the smoke of battle. He was
a man of great endurance and un
swerving tenacity of purpose; but in
society he was awkward and embar
rassed, and he was very sensitive to
the opinion of others. He was not
a good conversationalist save in the
presence of intimate friends, when
his fluent language and vivid imag
ery held all spellbound. He was
dreamy and absent-minded save in
the presence of need or in defying
circumstances; then he was indeed
tireless and sleepless, for the ear
nestness of the occasion obliterated
all thought of self and concentrated
his energies, showing the true no
bility of his nature. The predomi
nant trait of his life was courage,
as one of his strongest characteris
tics was the sense of justice.
An incident which occurred in the
first days of the war influenced his
life to the end. He was holding some
prisoners in a house in Greenville,
Miss. Among these prisoners was a
citizen who was the victim of som
nambulism. Walking in his sleep,
this man made his way to Cleburne’s
room and assaulted the sentry. Cle
burne, hearing the noise and think
ing it an attack of the enemy, sprang
to his feet and with his revolver shot
the man, mortally wounding him.
Cleburne was entirely exculpated for
this act, but all his life was tinged
with the melancholy of remorse.—

It would be as hard to pick out the
most striking sentences in Mr. Wat
son’s second chapter on Socialism, in
the November Magazine, as it would
to tell which is the brightest spark
that flames when flint strikes steel
with amazing force and rapidity. The
whole thing simply scintillates.
