Of Special Interest.A
The New Orlane Times publishes a
short article, which we append, re
lative to the endorsement of country TO.
paper. We hope the idea of the P
Tines will be seriously entertanled, R
It say.: par
There has been some disuoesaonD a nd
to the refusal of our banks to dis- p
count country paper. It would seem par
that the true remedy for this state of .
things lies in the establishment of
Sspecial banks for this purpose. IL
would be better still if the system In
vogue in some others cities could be Do)
introduced here. Certain brokers aah
might make country paper a Spe. a
Scialty. Then the merchant. In sell. Ol
I ing a bill of goods, could ascertain wh
the rate obtainable for the custom
er' paper, and sell his goods on that n
basis. The customer would give his w
note, payable to his own order, and ans
I by him endorsed. The broker would mi
issue daily a printed list of the paper be
he has for sale, with a number and
the rate opposite each obligation.
d This list should be forwarded to all
the country banks, and they could
then telegraph for such paper as
they might choose to take. The
system would obviate the looknlag up LI
of a groat deal of capital, and would
v relieve the merchant from a liability
w that Is not properly his. There is
;a no good reason why the merchant
should be forced to endorse his cuse
tomer's paper.
