which he could not pass, that Gen
eral Taylor wanted support to come
as soon as possible for the protection
of the artillery on the right flank.
The order was promptly obeyed at
double-quick, although the distance
must have been nearly a mile. They
found the enemy moving in three
lines upon the batteries of Captain
Braxton Bragg and the section of ar
tillery commanded by George H.
Thomas. The Mississippians came
up in line, their right flank opposite
the first line of the advancing enemy,
and at a very short range opened fire.
All being sharpshooters, those to
ward the left of the line obliqued to
the right, and at close quarters and
against three long lines very few
shots could have missed. At the
same time the guns of Bragg and
Thomas were firing grape. The effect
was decisive; the infantry and artil
lery of the enemy immediately re
tired.
At the close of the day Santa Anna
bugled the retreat, as was supposed,
to go into quarters; but when the
next sun rose, there was no enemy
in our front.
The news of this victory was re
ceived in the United States with a
degree of enthusiasm proportionate
to the small means with which it was
achieved, and generosity was excited
by the feeling that General Taylor
had been treated with injustice.
Thenceforward the march of “Old
Rough and Ready’’ to the White
House was a foregone conclusion.
In this battle, while advancing to
meet the enemy, then pressing some
of our discomfited volunteers on the
left of the field of battle, I received
a painful wound, which was rendered
more severe in consequence of re
maining in the saddle all day, al
though wounded early in the morn
ing. A ball had passed through the
foot, leaving in the wound broken
bones and foreign matter, which the
delay had made it impossible then to
extract. In consequence I had to re
turn home on crutches.
In the meantime a Senator of Mis
sissippi had died, and the Governor
had appointed me his successor. Be
fore my return home President Polk
had also appointed me brigadier gen
eral of volunteers, an appointment
which I declined on the ground that
volunteers are militia, and that the
Constitution reserved to the State
the appointment of all militia offi
cers. This was in 1847. In January,
18 48, the Mississippi Legislature
unanimously elected me United
States Senator for the rest of the un
expired term, and in 1850 I was re
elected for the full term as my own
successor. In the United States Sen
ate I was chairman of the Military
Committee, and I also took an active
part in the debates on the Compro
mise measure of 1850, frequently op
posing Senator Douglas, of Illinois,
in his theory of squatter sovereignty,
and advocating, as a means of pa
cification, the extension of the Mis
souri Compromise line to the Pacific.
When the question was presented to
Mississippi as to whether the State
should acquiesce in the Compromise
legislation of 1850, or whether it
should join the other Southern
States in a convention to decide as to
the best course to pursue in view of
the threatened usurpations of the
Federal Government, I advocated a
convention of the Southern States,
with a view to sucji co-operation as
might effectually check the exercise
of constructive powers, the parent of
despotism, by the Federal Govern
ment.
The election for governor was to
occur in November, and I was called
on to take the place vacated by the
candidate who had withdrawn from
the canvass. It was a forlorn hope,
especially as my health had been im
paired by labors in the summer can
vass, and there was not time before
the approaching election to make
such a canvass as would be needed
to reform the ranks of the Democ
racy. However, as a duty to the
party I accepted the position, and
made as active a campaign as time
permitted, with the result that the
majority against the party was re
duced to less than one thousand.
From this time I remained engaged
in quiet farm labors until the nomi
nation of Franklin Pierce, when I
went out to advocate his election,
having formed a very high opinion
of him as a statesman and a patriot
from observations of him in 1837
and 1838, when he was in the United
States Senate. On his election as
President, I became a member of his
cabinet, filling the office of Secretary
of War during his entire term.
During these four years I proposed
the introduction of camels for ser
vice on the Western plains, a sug
gestion which was adopted. I also
introduced an improved system of in
fantry tactics, effected the substitu
tion of iron for wood in gun car
riages, secure'" rifled muskets and ri
fles and the use of Minie balls, and
advocated the increase of the de
fenses of the seacoast by heavy guns
and the use of large-grain powder.
While in the Senate I had advo
cated as a military necessity, and as
a means of preserving the Pacific Ter
ritory to the Union, the construction
of a military railway across the con
tinent, and as Secretary of War I
was put in charge of the surveys of
the various routes proposed. Per
haps for a similar reason —my pre
vious action in the Senate —I was
also put in charge of the extension
of the United States Capitol.
The administration of Mr. Pierce
presents the single instance of an ex
ecutive whose cabinet witnessed ho
change of persons during the whole
term. At its close, having been re
elected to the United States Senate,
I re-entered that body.
During the discussion of the Com
promise measures of 1850, the re
fusal to extend the Missouri Com
promise line to the Pacific was early
put on the ground that there was no
constitutional authority to legislate
slavery into or out of any territory,
which was in fact and seeming intent
a repudiation of the Missouri Com
promise, and it was so treated in the
Kansas-Nebraska bill.
Subsequently Mr. Douglas, the ad
vocate of what was called squatter
sovereignty, insisted upon the rights
of the first immigrants into the ter
ritory to decide upon the question
whether migrating citizens might
take their slaves with them, which
meant, if it meant anything, that
Congress could authorize a few set
tlers to do what it was admitted Con
gress itself could not do. But out of
this bill arose a dissension which
finally divided the Democratic party
and caused its defeat in the presiden
tial election of 1860. And from this
empty, baseless theory grew the Iliad
3effersoftiaa
of our direst woes.
When Congress met in the fall of
1860 I was appointed one of a Senate
committee of thirteen to examine and
report on some practicable adjust
ment of the controversies which then
threatened the dissolution of the
Union. lat first asked to be excused
from the committee; but at the so
licitation of friends agreed to serve,
avowing my willingness to make any
sacrifice to avert the impending
struggle. The committee consisted
of men belonging to the three polit
ical divisions of the Senate; the
State rights men of the South, the
Radicals of the North, and the North
ern Democrats, with one member
who did not acknowledge himself as
belonging to any one of the three di
visions—Mr. Crittenden, an old-time
Whig and the original mover of the
Compromise resolutions. When the
committee met, it was agreed that,
unless some measure which would
receive the support of the majority
of each of the three divisions could
be devised, it was useless to make
any report; and after many days of
anxious discussion and a multiplicity
of propositions, though the Southern
State rights men and the Northern
Democrats and the Whig, Mr. Crit
tenden, could frequently agree, they
could never get a majority of the
Northern Radicals to unite with them
in any substantive proposition. Fi
nally the committee reported their
failure to find anything on which the
three divisions could unite. Mr.
Douglas, who was a member of the
committee, defiantly challenged the
Northern Radicals to tell what they
wanted. As they had refused every-,
thing, he claimed that they ought to
be willing to tell what they proposed
to do.
When officially informed that Mis
sissippi had passed the ordinance of
secession, I took formal leave of the
Senate, announcing for the last time
the opinions I had so often expressed
as to State sovereignty and as a con
sequence of it the right of a State to
withdraw its delegated powers. Be
fore I reached home I had been ap
pointed by the convention of Missis
sippi commander-in-chief of its army,
with the rank of major general, and
I at once proceeded with the task of
organization. I went to my home in
Warren County in order to prepare
for what I believed was to be a long
and severe struggle. Soon a messen
ger came from the Provisional Con
federate Congress at Montgomery,
bringing the unwelcome notice that I
had been elected Provisional Presi
dent of the Confederate States. But,
reluctant as I was to accept the hon
or and carefully as I had tried to
prevent the possibility of it, in the
circumstances of the country I could
not refuse it; and I was inaugurated
at Montgomery February 18, 1861,
with Alexander H. Stephens, of Geor
gia, as Vice-President.
From this time to the fall of the
Confederate Government my life was
part of the history of the Confed
eracy and of the War between the
States. It is impossible, therefore,
to follow it in detail.
In the selection of a cabinet I was
relieved from a difficulty which sur
rounds that duty by the President of
the United States, for there were no
“sections” and no “party” distinc
tions. All aspirations, ambitions,
and interests had been merged in a
