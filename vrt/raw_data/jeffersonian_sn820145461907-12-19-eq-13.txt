GIRL.
WhoEo girl goes wrong? Some
mo-her’s—-perhaps living, perhaps
desd —but always hers.
Why do girls go wrong? Sometimes
through ignorance, often through am
bition, oftenest through deception.
How many girls go wrong? Thou
sands every year. Today there are
fuliy six thousand in the seventy-one
Florence Crittonton Homes trying to
g&in ©outage to face a frowning world
(i’jtllea women usually get a chilling
reception) and to learn som© occupa
tion which will help them to be self
supporting. This is about the aver
age number always within the mis
sion walls, and yet the faces change
almost daily.

whit you can do to HELP their
HELPERS. Not all can be mission
workers, but all can help those who
are. Though no one whom you know,

5 thus fall©® by the waysdde, let ut»

dec perate need® of these strangers
who are so naedy.
