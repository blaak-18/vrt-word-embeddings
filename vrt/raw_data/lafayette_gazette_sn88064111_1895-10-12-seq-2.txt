Th e Deat crati one insertion ve this pa
" wry, labde o raspect. sic.. a cents a line; an.
nttee of DeSoto parish has ordered j
a primary election to be held on
the 14th of November to nominate
pash and ward officers, at which
"all known Demociats, regardless
of colbr," will be permitted to vote.
Are the Democrats of DeSoto so '
weak in numbers that they mustI'
call on the negro voter to help 1
them? or have they reached that
stage when they will Jo anything.
no matter how wrong, for the sake
of office ?
Democracy in Louisiana means
white rule, or it means nothing, and 1
if that su;)remacy of the Caucasian
race guaranteed by Democracy, can
not be maintained without the ne
gro vote it is not worth having.
Where is the boasted white-su
premacy of North Louisiana when
the negroes are solicited as brother
Denocrats ? Have the sturdy yeo
manry of that section left the
Democratic party and joined the
Populists in such large numbers
that the leaders of the only white '
man's party are begging the ne
groes' assistance ? s
What a disgusting spectacle I
The Democratic party of a parish c
actually asking the negroes to be
come members an,! help nominate
candidates. It is to be hoped that r
DeSoto will find no second to this
disgraceful policy. People who '
desire political affiliation with the h
negroes have no business in the a
Democratic party. They should e
not be admitted as Democrats, or
the Democratic party is no more
what it has always been-the only
political organization that afforded
shelter to the white man of the s
P-r.h.

~ I While we are abusing the
l icans for affiliating with the *
ored man, here is a body of men e
styling itself a "Democratic Ex- c
ecutive Committee" Going the very "
thing which we find so reprehensi- i
ble when done by the enemy.
Will these black voters, whom an 8
esteemed Shereveport paper calls ia
"faithful and steadfast negro Demo- c
cratic friends" take a hand in the
selection of delegates to the Demo
cratic State convention ? If they t
are good enough for primaries, are t
they not good enough for delegates ?
and if they are good enough for e
delegates are they not worthy of :
being the nominees? Would any- a
one think of inviting a big, black li
midsummer coon to his table andc li
not allow him to partake of t.e ,;
dinner ? Surely nut. -
Are we on the eve of having two ti
factions in the Democratic party
one lily-white and the other soot- a
black ? Even the bounty-flopped E
Republicans refuse to admit thec
colored brother ii, their ranks. s5
They know the contaminating influ
ence of Sambo's political associa- g
tion and his malodorous scent wh-n ei
crowded together in a convention. d
and be it said to their honor, that c
they will have none of him. A ti
"Democratic negro" is a physical o
impossibility. His very color isa
undemocratic. He could not be aP
Democrat it he would, antd heis
would not it he could. He is in- sI
stinctively a Republican and hed
would be a base ingrate if he were "
- Is it not a fact that "white supre

Democratic hosts in every cam

;CAN ,£ODIOUS COALFARIUSON.
Some one who signs himself
y. "Scott" communicates his wounaded
feeliags to The Advertiser in the
·. last issue of that paper, and calls
- The Gazette to account for its
strictures upon the meeting held
- some days ago an the first ward to
- nominate a candidate for Police
- Juror. It is indeed a source of re
gret to us that our style is so inele
- gant and not sufficiently "raeher
eAe" to suit the esthetic taste of this
luminous writer. While we are no
jcritic, it is painfully evident that
"Scott's" English is far from being
as pure as that of Addison,
and it is not good policy
to throw "bricks when you
live in a glass-house." "Scott"
should move to Boston, the great
to center of culture, the home of' the
h modern esthete.
"Scott" recovers from the con
vulsion occasioned by our inelegant
style and regains his strength suffi
st ciently to compare the ast ward
meeting to the one held in this town
Lt last April to nominate a Democratic
ticket for mayor and councilmen.
C He is certainly riot acquainted with
the manner the court-house meeting
s was called and conducted to com
d pare it to the miserable abortion
n which he attempts to dlefend. The
n court-house me ting was held pur
suant to a call signed by sixty four
Democrats adherents of both fac
tions. II was organized in the re -
ular way and conducted with the
utmost fairness. Nominations were
fnade in th- usual way. and an ex
e ecutive committee was appointed
from both factions present and
there was nothing irregular done or
e attempted. The proceedings were
kept and the records are ti ere and
speak for themselves. On the other
hand, the Ist ward meeting was a
cut-and-dried affair; it was irregu
tar, un-democratic. and arbitrary.
e fVOAfAJV'S RIGHT.
t Daily States.
s Miss Susan B. Anthony has al
, ways been considered the most level
L headed of all the women who have
e mounted the platform in advocacy
of the rights of woman to vote.
r She has heretofore steered clear of
e "ologies and isms," of t:,ird parties
v and chisms, and has kept right on
1 her way demanding woman's right.
L simply because it is, as she believ s,
woman's right, and she has never
condescended to offer to deliv, r the
C "woman vote" to any party or fac
:tion in return for the aid of parts
a or faction. Hence she has exer
Scised a powerful influence in con
Sverting women and even men to
Sher way of thinking. But a recent
move would indicate that the old
girl is lo ing her equillibriu:m. It
is difficult for her admirers to con
- ceive that she was the author of the
e Iollowing resolution which, by the
Sby, was unanimously adlopted by
,;the Kansas Equal Suffrage Associa
tion:
"Resolved, That it is the duty of
r every self-respecting woman ir. the
f State of Kansas to fold her hands
_ and refuse to help any mor 1. re
ligious, charitable, reform, or po
1 litical association until the men of
ithe State s a.il strikre rie adljective
'"male" from th:- siufrage clause of
the constitution."
t l.is sounds m.iore like an utter
Sance of tn;e gaseous and bellicose
Ex-Governor Letvelling or the
cranky Mrs. lease than that of tele
shrewdest of women politicians.
Since when has it been good law,
good ethics, or good politics that
Seither men or women shall refuse to
do any good thing because by cir
t cutustances of law, social condi
tion, physical or mental infirmity,
or political deficiency, they are not
able to do all good things? The
policy proposed is as illogical as it
,is reckless. Who will be the chief
sufferers if moral reforms are aban
doned ? W'omen. Men co ,Id
manage to get along in a state of
moral anarchyv, but the domestic
sex woud hay - uncomfortable times
under smce. r'ilitions. The threat
t) abandon religious, work would be"
terrifying to ti.he clergy if it were
taken serious. Without tie sup
port of t;me women mosi, if not all
churches would dry utip and disap
pear. In an average congregation
on a Sunday morning tihree fourths
of the worshipers are of the disfran
chised sex, and it is safe to say tihat
three-fourths of the maen who ar:
present at there under female com
pulsion. Hence Miss Anthony has
been guilty of the unpardonable
blunder, if not crime, of striking at
her friends; and if she would succeed
in making all the charitable and
ministering acts of woman a con
dition precedent upon her being
granted the right of franchise then
she will have become a curse rather
then a blessing to her sex. But,
thanks to the gentle sptrit of wo- I
man, a myriad of Susan Anthonys I
can never so distort her nature.
. The only striking feature of the
It pictures of tbhe young Duke of
d Marlborough, who is to marry Miss
e Conseule Vanderbilt and transport
is the young lady and her fortung to
:s England is the magnitude of the
d boutonniere which he wears on the
o lapel of his coat. He is a dull
e looking young fellow in spite of the
fact that he is the decendent of a
race of warriors, and it is quite
- 'clear that his effeminate mind is
is unable to- realise the fact that
o flowers should adorn the corsage of
it women and .nedals the breasts of
g men.-States.
t There is one medicine which
Y every family should be provided
u with. We refer- to Chamberlain's
" Pain Balm. When it is kept at
It hand the severe pain of a burn or
scald may be promptly relieved and
e the sore healed in much less time
than when medicine has to be sent
for. A sprain may be promptly
t treated hefore inflammation sets in,
which insures a cure in about one
third the time otherwise required.
d Cuts and bruises should receive im
n mediate attention, before the parts
c become swollen, and when Cham
berlain's Pain Balm is applied it
h will heal them without matter being
formed, and without leaving a scar.
B A sore throat may be cured in one
- night. A piece of flannel dam
n pened with this liniment and bound
over the seat of pain, will cure
lame back or pain in the side or
chest in tweniy-four hours. It is
r the most valuable, however, for
- rheumatism. Persons afflicted with
- this disease will be deligihted with
the prompt relief from pain which
it affords, and it can be depended
upon to effect a complete cure.
