Hair Vigor
For restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A dressing
which is at
once agreea
ble, healthy,
and effectual
for preserv
ting the hair.
It soofn re
stores falied
or gray hair
to its orir'inwl
color, with the gloiS ai idfr..shwi'ss of
youth. Thin hair is thickemL d, flil.
ing hair checked, anld ialdness often,
though not always, curod by its
use. Nothling can restore the hair
where, the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayvd;
but such as remain can be saved rby
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of fouling
the hair with a pasty sediment, it
wilV seep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or falling off,
and consequently preve, t baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of danldruill, which is
often so uncleanly and ofitbsive.
Free from those deleterious sub
stances which wake some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to the
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted nmerel for
a HAIRI DRESSING. nothing else
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.

Ayer's Cathartic Pills,
For the relief
and core of all
derangements in
the stomach, liv
er, and bowels.
They are a. mild
aperient, and an
excellent purga
tive. Being pure.
, ly vegetable, they
contain no mer
cury oi mineral
whatever. Much
serious sickness and suffering is prevented by
their timely use; and every family should
have them on hand for their protection and
relief, when required. Long experience has
proved them to be the satest, surest, and
best of all the Pills with which the market
abound.s. By their occasional use, the blood
is purifled, the corruptions of the system ex
pelled, obstructions removed, and the whole
machinery of lith restored to its healthy activ
ity. Internal,organs which become clogged
and sluggish are elealned by Ayer's Pills,
and stimulated into action. 'This incipient
disease is changed into health, the value of
which change, when reckoned on the vast
mulltitudes who enjoy it, can hardly be com
puted. Their suagar coathig ulakes them
pleasant to take, and preserves their virtues
unimpaired for any length of time, so that
they are ever fresh, and perfectly reliable.
Although searching, they are mild, and oper
ate without disturbance to the constitution or
diet or occupation.
Full directions are given on the wrapper to
each box, how to use them as a Family Physic,
and for the iollowing complaints, which these
Pills rapidly cure:
For Dyspeplia or Indgestion, iste .
lessuness, Lanuor, anld Los of Appe.
itle, they should be taken moderately to
stinlmulate the stomach, and restore its healthy
tone and action.
For Liver Ceompalaint and its various
symptoms, Bilions Headache, Aick
]Heudache, Jaundlce or Green Nick.
ness, Ilion. Colic antd Bilious re.
vers, they should be jaudiciously taken for
each case, to correct the diseasw:cl action, or
remove the obstructions which canuse it.
For IDyentery or Dlarrhtraa but one
mild d(ose is generally reqluired.
For Jhenuatihm., Gout, Gravel,
Palpitaution of the luear, Pain Io
the ~ilde, Back, and loins, they should
Mbe continuously takew, as required, to changO
the diseasel action of the systemr. With such
change those complaints disippear.
For ]ropsy and Dropitcal Swell.
tlSagr, they should be taken m large and fre
quent doses to produce the effect of a drastic
purge.
'or mppressie.l, a large dose should le
taken, as It produces the desired effect by
sympathy.
As a Dtnner Pill, take one or two Pills to
promote digestion, and relieve the stemach.
An occasional dose stimulates the stomach
and bowels, restores the appetite, and invigor
ates the system. Hence it is often advanta
geous where no serious derangement exists.
One who feels tolerably well, often finds that
a dose of these Pl4lt makes him feel decid
edly better, fom their cleansing and reno.

treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful inftluence upon these vari

There is no cathartic lbr the purpose
