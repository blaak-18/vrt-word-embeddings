The Gazette would like to know pe
why some newspapers are always
ready to give advice to the farmers,
who, it seems to us are getting ,
along as well as the rest of'the folks. ar
Why not tell the carpenters, the re
blacksmiths, the painters, the doc
tors and the lawyers how to work? m
Why should the same things be
drummed into the ears of the horny c,
handed tillers of the soil every time li
an editor is short of news to fill his
paper? No, gentlemen, our farmers U
know how to run their farms, and a
if many of them have been unsucess_
ful in late years the causes are the
same that have crippled nearly every n
industry in the country. n
The Louisiana delegation ap
peared before the committee on ap- "
propriations yesterday and made an s
earnest appeal for the payment of t'
the bounty on last year's crop as a g
matter of simple justice to the sugar tl
planters of this State. The argu- t
ments of Senators Caffery and Blan- s
chard, and Messrs. Boatner and ii
Price were forcible and received a li
respectable hearing, but the char- t
acter of the questions put from n
time to time by the members of the d
committee showed that there is very 1
little disposition on their part to l
grant the bounty. This is dis- i
couraging, as a few weeks ago, .
there was some reason to hope that It
the justice of the claims of the I
planters would be recognized and
the committee make a favorable re
port.-States.
The supervising Architect, at
WVashington, has sent to MRr. (Grant
Wilkins, Chief of Construction for
the Cotton States and International
SExposition at Atlanta, two plans 1
1_- for the enlargement of the Govern- 1
. nent Building. The edifice as
originally planned was to be r6ox261o
feet. IThe amount allowed for its
construction was $5o,ooo. As the
Sbid was only $27,446, the surplhs
. will be used to enlarge the building.
One plan proposes the addition of
S.eighty feet to the length. The
other proposes forty feet addition
Sto the length, and a seventy foo

. ZZALS.FOR AC O4. the ]
That Lafayette' shou have.-ene a pc
yetfvidentpeac
or two refini ies IW is cI4ly evid peac
to all who 'appreciate  -the serious TAI
predicament in which many of our
cane-growers are at the present -time. Z
The great loss, (an'd in some cases Tay
the total loss) sustained by the cane- min
growers shows most conclusively says
that no one can plant cne with any plic
degree of safety unless there is a re- and
r finery in close proximity to his field. lot
4 During the last year two or three thie
- movements were on foot to build a stuf
- refinery in or near Lafayette, but mal
due to some cause or other, they onl:
were not carried to a successful ter- are
r mination. But because we failed whi
last year should not prevent a more son
determined effort this year. Now wo<
that the people, the merchants and our
business men of the town as well as he
the farmers, have been forcibly im- tric
pressed with the necessity of a re- lot
s finery, it is hoped that every person he
e whose success depends upon the 10o
e prosperity of the whole community, say
will be more than willing to do his the
share, however small that may be. cat
a The situation is indeed serious and Co
e unless the people get together and he
decide upon some plan of action to me
L- build a refinery, the fact is painfully pul
a apparent that cane growing in La- anm
,e fayette will have to be considerably del
!s decreased if not entirely abandoned. gre
,g The loss in cane alone this year, we su<
n believe, would be nearely enough to T1
te build a refinery, and yet a move
ment last year having that purpose th<
in view met with very little en- fot
rt couragement. Another loss like fo,
Y the one sustained by this section by
this season would cause irreparable i.(
e injury to the general trade. Our tes
a- merchants and other business men ca
t- should concentrate all their energies Cr
ts to secure the capital to build a cen- ,
e- tral refinery in or near Lafayette- be
of it matters not on whose lot. In the . la
is language of the street, "get a move uI
s- on .yourselves," gentlemen. The th
of time is ripe for action. You must do nt
n- something to help the farmers, and fe
by helping them help yourselves. fa
Their prosperity means your pros- le;
)w perity. Their ruin means your ruin. A.
ys TIE POULTRY INDUSTRY. S,
rs, The poultry business is the only T.
°g one which has not suffered this year, se
. and considering the unsatisfactory P.
he results of all other farm industries,I d<
)c- we may reasonably expect to see cr
e more chickens raised in Lafayette
be parish this year than in any pre- P'
ny ceeding one. In this business, un- ti
me like that of cotton, there need be n
his no fear of "over production," andti s
ers unlike cane, chickens and eggs will C
Ind always find a ready market- Our st
Speople can find buyers at home, or; s<
the if they prefer, they may make ship- to
ery ments to New Orleans, where the -
market prices are always good. a'
ap- There is no branch of the livestock tl
ap- interest which has received a larger i
an share of success in proportion to a
of the capital invested and the time d
a given to the work. The truth of P
gar the matter is, the man who goes at o
giu- the poultry business in a common- c
an- sense way and puts business into!'I
and it the same as he would into any
Sa line of business that requires fore- li
mar- thought, good coinionsense, plan- r
omn ning, energy and economy in con- fi
the ducting, will make a success of it. t:
cry There are dismal failures in the 1,
to business, it is true, anti so there are 0
lisj- in all kinds of business; the inevit- 1j
go, able results of poor management or
hat no management. The farmer who
the has been keeping a25 to 5o hens and i
and keeps on the even tenor of his way 1
re- year after year, will make money on
fowls, andl then keeping large flocks
applying similar principles in their
at care, will reap benefit in proportion.

mnal Ve may call the Populists cranks,
ans but the fact remains that some of
srn- the best bills that ever came up be
as fore Congress were introduced by
260 them. IFor instance we may cite
its Snator ]'feffer's bill to limit funeral
the expenses for dead senators and rep
plus rescntatives. It is indeed fortunate
ing. that some one has had the courage I
Sof to call a halt to this imposition on
The the people, and all honor to the
tion Kansas senator who dared to take a
foo- stand in the matter. As these funer
ges- als have been conducted they have
to been infinitely disgraceful. A corn
It mittce is appointed to accompany
eeks the remaifs, a special train is secured
cted for the purplose, with the steward,
any cooks, etc., in ample supplies. Thus
om- equipped and provided with all the
stry good things Uncle Sam's money can
that buy these dignified gentlemen speed
cing across the country with a corpse in
con- one car and cards and unlimited
mis- wine in another. If they paid
the for these luxuries themselves no one

o TIE A. P. A.'s AT -IVORK. of l
A special from Butte, Mon., says mat
e th'it a committee of twelve from the Rat
- four local A. P. A. lodges has left esp,
for Helena with an address issued trai
n by President J. R. Caldwell to the late
lei members of the Legislature, pro- cqu
ir testing the election of the Republi- bes
can national chairman, lion. Thos. for
s Carter, as United States Senator. sur.
-A printed copy of the address will saf4
be laid on the desk of every Legis- He
e lator and read by the clerk of the est
re House. Carter is a Catholic, and Me
le the address contains a violent de- At
to nunciation or alleged papal inter- it
d ference with civil and political af- Lit
s. fairs in this country, and warns the h
s- legislators in the name of the A. P. le
A. not to elect a Romanist to the A
'. Senate on penalty of political death. cIn
ly The address created a tremendous :le
, sensation and it is bclieved if the A. Ap
ry P. A.'s in the Legislature obey or
, ders it may defeat the Republican
c caucus nominee for Senator.

e- people throughout the country that :;,,
n- this dangerous organization would
be not thrive on American soil,. but in- g-.
ntl stead of .dying out it is bec nin i,

erj more regrettable in this case was thu:
to action of the Babtist conference in I
ie denouncing the apointmnecnt anad
of protesting against the elevation to I,
at office of Roman Catholics on ac
n- count of their religious faith. I
Ito These fanatics should coime to
Mny Louisiana and take lessons in re
re- ligious tolerance. Here a man's
in- religion has nothing to do with his
,n- fitness to hold office. In sone dis-i
it. tricts, where the Catholics greatly
the 1predominate, nearly all the public
are officials are Protestants, and no ob- n
eit- jection is raised against them be- l'
or cause of their religion. The voters[!:,
rho do not care a snap if a candidate is AI
nd a Methodist, a Dabtist, an lpisco
.ay palian, a Jew, or if he nee-ct goes to (
on church. Thank God our people
cks are too broad-iintded to persecute

hope that Apaism will never gain a
foothold in the Pelican State.

be- Jackson was quite and clcver in
by his novcincits, resolute in his pItr
cite poses, faitful alike to his friends and
eral iis enemies. Nobody was ever in I
l- doubt where to find himi. A's a

Date rallied to hint--as, indeed, theI
rage have rallied to Cleveland--but the

In this latter respect, the condi

any those who have some ax to grind.

without selfish motive, would vent

to come to the scratch when it is Wh

are the features which distinguish An
Grover Cleveland from Andrew to sal

his bridges behind him, and was wioll
