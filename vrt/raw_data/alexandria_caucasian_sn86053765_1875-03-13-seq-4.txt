ing article on tbe eucalyptus globa
1 us, or bin« gum of. Tasmania. It
will be raid With diaappohitment,
however, bjr cultivator« of thé tree
in tbfe eoirotfy who Hope to obtain
«owe light ou the dinatic condi
tion* ' essential to its flourishing
away from its native «est. The
writer, M. Planchon, insists on tbe
ilistii«etlph that trees maj be natu
ralixed bot not soclimated. They
will either grow or not grow in a
given locatity, and experience alone
can determine what region is ftuita
ble for them. Nojr is there néeeésa
lily a reciprocity in tliis naturalisa -
tion of plants and vegetables.
From England, for .example, nn
nierous wild and cultivated plants
have passed to Australia and tbriv
«eve, though generally deteri
itéftg ; but not a single Anstra
liait apeeie hne yet been propagated
in England outside of ornamental
gardens, where they are cultivated
by thousands. Jiyen in Southern
Europe and Northern Africa, all
tbatoan be said of the eucalyptus
is that it has been introduced but
not yet naturalised—in other words,
it still requires the care of mau.
The experience of the Cape of Good
Hope, the Argentine Republic, of
Cuba and California, is puhaci ) over
by M. Planchon, who confines his
attention to the shores ol the Med
iterranean. In Algiers the grant
tree has prospered wouderfalty, and
already has given a new character
to the landscape. Twenty years
»go it grew there unknown, hut
cultivation on a large scale and
with a purpose was not attempted
till 1861-1862.» It now lines the
railroads and highways, and is ob»
srrvable singly, in clumps and te
groves,?«» that itfeems like part of
the indiginotis vegetation. Im the
south of Ftance it thrives only
wlieee the orange tree does without
nrtifluial shelter, L x. in the iW
tern Pyrenees, the Var yand tbe
Maritime Alps, tho best known
sites being Hyeres Cannes, Antibcs,
Nice; Vitleftanche and Moroco.
Open air cultivation has been tried
at Montpellier, Marseillea and îfar.»
lionne, but not without great rieke
and disappotntments, and M. Plan
adversely on the cli
chon decides adversely on the
mate of Languedoc, and even of tbe
western portion of Provence.
Iu onr Southern States tbe chief
hope reposed in the euealyptns is
that it will overcome 'miasmata ;
mid not Without reasoq. The
ver tree* is the name given it in
Spain by the people of Valencia
Iront a practical acquaintance with
its p operties. Not only does• it
absorb immense quantities of mois
turc from snlimpy soils, and give
off a balsamic efftisiuiu, but it fur
nishes the vateria medico, with a
substance which is a lebrifuge in
the case of a large number of inter
mittent fevers; it has disiusecting
ami nntiseptio qualities; topically
applied to wounds it prevents cica
trising its leâves in a moderate in
fnsiou will supply the place of tea
as a stimulating beverage, and roll
ed into cigarettes they have a
soothing effect on the respiratory
organs. Proper Merimee is said,
in his last illness at Cannes, to
have derived benefit in this wny
from the smoking of them. Tbe
eucalyptus Essence has also been
administered for bronehial attec
tions iu thp form of loseiiges ; and
a toilet article, of a powerful ami
very persistent odor, has been
made of it Great as are these
uses, the tree is perhaps'still more
to be welcomed for its timber. Its
rapid growth is not incompatible
(as is usua% the case) with a com
pact texture, whose value is height
cued by tife presence of resiuous
substances, eminently adapting the
Avood to resist salt water, and to
play an important part in uaval
architecture. For the same reason
it does not 1 rot in the soil, and is
used for railway sleepers, tor posts
mid piles,% for bridges, viaducty,
etc., etc. dome of the allied apt •
cies of the éucelyptus grobulns are
taller than it is, though' mention is
made qf a Iblue-gum plank nearly
170 feet loég* A single eucalyptus
amygdalitis has been known to sur
pass iu height the Strussburg spire
and even $iè* Great Pyramid. For
further particulars respecting the
subject of^is note we must refer
to M. Plaucbou's article, which is
remarkable, coneideriug that the
author vif .a Frenchman, in sag
gestiug ndw certain peculiarities of
the blue-gum lend support to tbe
development theory ot th<5 natural
