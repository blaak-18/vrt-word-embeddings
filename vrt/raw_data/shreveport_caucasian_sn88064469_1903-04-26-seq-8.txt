FASHIONABLE SUITS.
Elegant Patterns in the Most Approved
Styles.
A well fitting suit is one of the essen
tials to comfort, and when finished in
style it becomes almost a joy forever.
To fit well, a suit or any garment a gen
tleman would wear, must come from an
artist in his line, and one of the most
thorough is the "old reliable" A. Zorn,
whose fame and name is a guarantee of
satisfaction in every respect to any one
desiring a suit in the latest and most
approved style. A column or more could
be printed about Zorn's success. but suf
fice it to say that a gentleman who would
be well suited should call antleave his
orders with A. Zorn on Milam stree
opposite the Caddo Hotel.

THE TRAVELERS ASSOCIATION.
The representatives of the Travelers
Protective Association, whose annual
convention is being held in Shreveport,
are welcomed cordially. The presence
of these gentlemen in any town or city
is an event which arouses general in
terest. No men, as individuals and as a
class, are better informed, more genial,
persevering and enterprising as the ad
vance posts of civilization and as devel
opers of trade and traffic. As builders
and developers they are guided by the
spirit of peace, concord and fraternity,
and while, as individuals, they enter
tain their views political and exercise
their rights of citizenship, the organi
zation as a body can have no connec
tion with politics or politicians. The
mission of the organization is plain and
in its sphere is all powerful for good.
We trust these representatives of the
Travelers Protective Association and
of the U. C. T. will have a most profit
able and pleasurable session.

t -
I He Is Charged With Embezzling Seven
Hundred Dollars in Money.
-
E. H. McFadden, an employe of the
t Henry Rose Mercantile and Manufac
turing Company, has skipped the town.
He is charged with having embezzled
$700 of the firm's money which he had
collevted from city customers. Being
suspected. he was being checked, and,
apprehensive of the result, he left sud
denly. Although he earned a moderate
salary, McFadden was what is called
"a high roller," "a gay and festive
bird." He had been in the employ of
seveial railroads and was engaged by
Mr. Rose about six months ago. It is
the old story, and the moral-never
mind the moral, but be honest. An hon
est man, the noblest work of God, never
becomes entangled in the meshes of the
law or is ever put in jail for stealing.

There is, seemingly ,great rejoicing
in Alexandria over the defeat of F. M.
Welch, Republican, by Thomas Craw

over Welch was twenty-one votes. It
may be queried by what influence or
power has Welch maintained himself in
a town which should be overwhelm
ingly Democratic?
