Masons Oppose Leach for Governor
CRAFT IN MINNESOTA SEEK TO
DEFEAT MEMBER OF ORDER
“FELLOWSHIP FORUM” ARTICLE
ATTRACTS WIDE ATTEHTIOH
(Special to the Fellowship Forum.)'
Minneapolis. Mayor George E.
Leach, of this city, who has formally
filed as a Republican candidate for
governor of Minnesota, is running on
a pro-Catholic platform. Although
Leach is a 32 degree “Mason’' he has
earned the opposition of 95 per cent
of the Masons of Minnesota. Despite
the fact that Freemasonry for the
first time in the history of the order
in this city entered politics and tried
its best to defeat Leach when he was
candidate for re-election as mayor
last summer, the Catholic votes gave
him another term.
The “Leach rally for governor” was
held here recently and was called by
Dr. W. F. Maetz, who comes from
New Ulm, the most disloyal part of
the country doiring the war. The
principal speaker of the night was
Rev. David J. Moran, a Catholic
priest, of Farmington. Others speak
ers were Dr. Hugo Hartig, Minne
apolis; Gerald V. Barron, Cloquet; and
Dr. M. E. Withrow, International
Falls. Political bosses who sent mes
sages of congratulation to the meet
ing were: Judge Carroll A. Nye,
Moorhead; Mayor Victor L. Power,
Hibbing; and Mayor Victor E. Essl
ing, Eveleth. (Notice the names of
the leading factors behind Leach’s
candidacy.)
Opposed by Masons
A prominent business man of this
city described Leach in the following
words:
“Leach is a thirty-second degree
Mason, but he ought not to be. Dur
ing his campaign for mayor last sum
mer he was the subjest of bitter con
troversy between the Masons, and it
was the first time in the history of
Minneapolis lodges that they had poli
tics in the lodge rooms. Every lodge,
after being closed, would have politi
cal meetings and committees ap
pointed to work for the defeat of
Leach. But his first term cemented
him so much with the Catholic ele
ment of the town that he was re
elected in the face of this Masonic
ioipposition. Masons supported him
during his first campaign. They re
gretted it, though, shortly after his
election, because he immediately bow
ed to the will of the powerful Roman
faction of the city.
“During the campaign last summer
it was reported that Leach was going
to divorce his wife. Right after the
election he was granted a divorce,
and report now has it that he has
married a young Catholic woman of
California.
“It will be nothing short of a dis
grace to the state if he ever gets
elected governor, as he will out-Wal
ton Walton/’
Strange Bedfellows
A good example of how Freema
sonry views Leach’s candidacy is ex
pressed in the National Observer, a
M' sonic periodical published in Min
neapolis. The paper comments as
follows:
“Announcement has been made that
Mayor George E. Leach, of Minne
apolis, will be a candidate for gover
nor of Minnesota at the coming elec
tion. Few, outside of those directly
interested in boosting Mayor Leach,
seem to take this candidacy at all
seriously, but there is a phase of it
that should not be ignored.
“As matters now stand, Mayor
Leach has the solid backing of the
Romanists of the state. Those
classed as ‘radicals/ and the social
ists are with him almost to a man.
Booze and vice law violators form
another wing of the forces under his
command, and, oddly enough, those
rated during the war as strictly pro-
German seem to have swung in line
for him.
“In outlining this situation there is
not the slightest intention to intimate
in any way that Mayor Leach can be
properly classed with any of the ele
ments mentioned, our only aim and
object is to point out conditions as
we find that they exist.
“The old adage that ‘politics makes
strange bedfellows,’ was never more
. fully demonstrated in history than it
' is today by the line-up for Leach/’

DENY WALTON
HEARIND IN APPEAL
U. S. Supreme Court Refuses to Grant
Washington, D. C.—Jack Walton,
impeached governor of Oklahoma,
suffered another defeat this week
when the United States Supreme
Court denied his petition to review
his trial and removal from office. The
court gave no opinion in the case. Its
action in effect upholds the impeach
ment of Walton. Walton’s petition to
the Supreme Court blamed the Klan
for his impeachment and said that the
organization controlled the legisla
ture that removed him from office.
The Supreme Court’s decision
against Walton proved beyond a
doubt the falsity of his charge against
the Klan. It proves that his im
peachment was brought about by his
own tyrannical methods. It also
proves that America is no place for
corrupt despotism.

One of the greatest coming sport
events for the United States as a

world’s greatest bronco busters, bull
doggers, ropers, etc. Cowboys and
cowgirls from all over the nation
took part in the rodeo held
ech fterrtoon from 2:30 to 6:30.
This was not a wild west show, but a
pure and unadulterated contest of
cowboy sports.
On Friday night, January 26, a
monster public naturalization cere
mony was held by the San Antonio
Klan and it was expected to be one
of the largest ever held in that sec
tion. Approximately one thousand
candidates were expected to be nat
uralized. The local degree team had
charge of the ceremony.
Freeport, 111.—With the announced
intention of cleaning up the town,
members of the Ku Klux Klan and
town officers of Stockton, 111., this
week raided a hotel and cheese fac
tory, seizing ten barrels of wine at
the latter place and arresting five
persons in the hotel. Those arrest
ed were booked on disorderly eonduct
charges.

FOREIGN BORN ARE
DRY LAW VIOLATORS
Kansas City.—Fifty-five per cent
of the men and women arrested in
Kansas City, Kan., in the last four
years for violations of state and na
tional prohibition laws were foreign
born, according to statistics complet
ed on the night of January 23 by
Frank Strickland, city chemist.
About 10 per cent of the population
of the city is foreign boro.
Strickland gathered his data from
the records of arrest accompanying
liquor submitted to him by the police
department for analysis. These rec
ords include the nativity of the per
son arrested.
There have been approximately
1,000 samples submitted for analysis
during the last four years, Strick
land said. The majority, in the last
two years, has been of home manu
facture.
“The records show that of the for
eign born, those from central Eu
ropean states are the most frequent
violators of our liquor laws,” Strick
land said.

WOODROW WILSON
; God’s plans for our Great War president on the earth
are over. He was placed at the helm of our government
daring that great tragedy because he was a genuine lover
of peace. The peace that he sought for, however, includ
ed the whole world. By his noble idealism he brought hu
manity to a higher plane of thinking.
But, sorry to say, he was not strong enough to regen
erate the hearts of a cruel, selfish, avaricious world, and it
hurt him deeply to see Europe sink back again into the
stink pots of an unholy diplomacy. President Wilson’s loss
will be felt by foes as well as friends. We pray that his
great influence might again operate in the fight against the
iniquitous selfishness rampant in Europe today.
We felt that God would use him still further to pull
the unsanctified diplomacy out of the mud. But he was
needed only to begin this great task. .Others will continue
it. His influence will live as long as the world stands, and
it will always be pulling upward.
The world wasn’t ready for Wilson after the war.
Heaven was ready, and it claimed him. We mourn his loss,
but we rejoice in the championship for good that will live
on. His crucifixtion may be the resurrection of a new plan
for world peace.
This day may be the Easter dawn of a glorious hope on
the part of those who are discouraged, disheartened and dis
tressed by the dreadful forces of evil that love self and hate
humanity. From the garden of his Gethsemane may come
the fair flowers of brotherly love and honesty among men.
This is our prayer, and our loss in the person of Mr. Wilson
will be the world’s gain.

BUTLER ORIVES BAD

General Butler Puts Picked Men on
Bandit Chasing Duty With
Motor Units.
-K-K-K
Philadelphia.—“ Shoot to kill,’ is the
order given police of the bandit
chasing squad by Brig. Gen. Smedley
D. Butler, Director of Public Safety,
in the week-end drive against all
forms of banditry.
The new fleet of armored bandit
chasing cars went into commission
today and the streets were patrolled
by them, supported by other police
utomobiles and scores of high-speed
motorcycles. In each unit were men
picked after tests in the pistol ranges
of the various stations who have
shown themselves to be “dead shots.”
“We’re not going to play with the
bandits,” said Director Butler, in is
suing his orders. “If they show fight/
we’ll make it hot for them.”
Another phase of this week’s po
lice activities will be closing of
dances of all kinds on Sundays. Ten
hotel men were called before Direc
tor Butler today and told to inform
their patrons that dances must vol
untarily' cease at midnight Saturday.
Even the most exclusive private
dances came under the ban.
Not to Run for Mayor
Later in the day at a luncheon,
General Butler emphatically denied
ho would be a candidate for the
mayority here in 1927.
“I have no political aspirations,”
he declared. “All I want to do is
live long enough to get home.”
The recent clean-up of this city, he
asserted, was due to 2,600 men in
the force of 4,900. “About 1,000 of
the 4,900,” he added, “are incapac
itated and are unable to keep the
rapid pace. We must find places for
them.”
Arming of all policemen with .45
calibre automatic pistols to do away
with the present lack of uniformity
in weapons on the force was an
nounced today by General Butler.
The announcement followed the
Ipeneral'fe inspection of policemen’s
revolvers. Every size shape and
make of weapons was displayed. Offi
cials explained that each policeman
purchased his own revolver.
Getting Their Guns
“Pathetic,” said the Director.
“From the way those policemen haul
ed up their skirts you’d have thought
they were looking for a box of
matches. It was tragic A bandit
could have riddled those men while
they were trying to find their guns.
One man had the muzzle of his re
volver plugged—to keep it clean. If
he had fired it he’d probably have
killed himself.”
A check-up of the police records
for the second crime drive showed a
total of more than 800 arrests for
various alleged offenses, including
sixty-seven for traffic violations.
Nearly 200 prisoners were taken in
raids on billiards and ‘pool rooms,
speakeasies and stores said to have
been operating as blinds for gamb
lers.
Ten men were taken from a pool
and billiard rooms in the center of the
city owned by Lew Tendler, Phil
adelphia’s well-known lightweight
boxer.
Sergeant John F. Mullin, one of
the Acting Lieutenants recently sus
pended by General Butler, was re
stored to duty in the rank of ser
geant by the Director. He will be
transferred to a different station,
however, General Butler said.

Washington.—E. L. Doheny’s test
imony involving William G. McAdoo,
Thomas W. Gregory and other prom
inent democrats is regarded as one
of the most destructive political
bombshells in years.
Its effect, the political observers
here predict, will be reflected alike
in the republican and democrat presi
dential situations.
Democratic politicians shied away
from open comment, though every
where the question' was heard “what
will Doheny’s testimony do to Mc-
Adoo’s candidacy?”
Doheny testified he had employed
McAdoo as attorney; had paid him a
total of about $250,000, and that Mc-
Adoo is now on the Doheny payroll
at $50,000 a year. He said Thomas
W. Gregory, one of the special coun
sel President Coolidge selected to
prosecute the oil lease cases had been
employed in connection with oil deals.
Aifti-McAdoo democrats at once
hailed this as definitely eliminating
McAdoo from the presidential con
test. They said he would not be able
to explain away his connection with
a magnate who figured so prominent
ly in the oil scandal.
McAdoo’s friends took the view
that Once McAdoo has fairly explain
ed his employment, the sting will be
taken out of Doheny’s testimony.
Senator J. A. Reed of Missouri,
who a few days ago announced his
candidacy for the democratic nomina
tion, is blamed by McAdoo’s friends
for steering the inquiry in McAdoo’s
direction. It was Reed who asked
that Doheny be summoned by the
senate committee. Reed said he
wanted to ask Doheny whether he
ever gave or loaned any money to
former government officials besides
Fall.
McAdoo is to appear before the
senate investigating committee to tell
what he did for Doheny to earn the
$250,000. He and his friends feel it
was unfair to drag him into the scan
day that way, and while they expect,
they say, to counteract to a great de
gree the harm done, they admit it will
be impossible to remove entirely the
impression created by Doheny’s test
imony that McAdoo was one of his
chief advisers on oil matters.
