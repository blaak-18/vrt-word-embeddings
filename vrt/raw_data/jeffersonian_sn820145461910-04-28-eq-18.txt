Varied and Interesting Opinions of the Foreign Mission
Question From The People
HOW MANY LANDLORDS CAN
WRITE A BETTER LETTER
THAN THIS POOR, ONE
HORSE TENANT?
Dear Friend: —Your reply to Bill
Howard in last issue of The Jeffer
sonian, while rather lengthy, was in
teresting from “a to Izzard.” The
more you tell of your life the more I
love you, honor you, respect you.
Fight on, the common people are
with you. Your fight on Foreign
Missions has convinced thousands of
your great love and sympathy for
the common people.
Recently my wife gave me a boy—
and his name is Tom Watson. lam
a land renter. Have had a lot of
sickness and misfortune. Lost my
first wife. Eleven in family—l have
to scuffle. It’s hard to keep the wolf
away. Not able to take any papers,
only the “Jeffs” and my county pa
per. I read everything you write.
The Jeffs get better all the time. . I
can’t do as much for you as I desire
—and when I say you, I mean the
cause you espouse—uplift of hu
manity. lam a Populist. My fath
er was. He was a Confederate sol
dier, Confederate veteran. Suffered
much for his country; he has been
dead twelve years. The Populists
have no organization, no campaign
funds —not many papers; what are
we to do? Most of us went into the
Democratic primary as the only way
to get, or help get, good men for our
offices.
The Union is doing very well here.
Much for us to accomplish, if we co
operate and do it.
Money here is scarce at this time
of year. Farmers are “pushed.”
Some sickness and deaths. Lots of
work and politics. I love your prin
ciples, and will do all I can to help
the work along.
Much love to you and all the read
ers of the Jeffs.
Always your friend,
LEROY L. WRIGHT.

Comment: — As my wife read the
foregoing letter to me, the character
and the intelligence of the writer
made a deep impression. In all such
cases, my first thought is, “Suppose
that man had been given a good edu
cation and a fair chance!”
In my time, I have met nearly all
the big men whose names are con
stantly in the public eye, and I have
yet to meet two celebrities whose
minds are naturally greater than
those of the old War Horse Sam
Walker, (who died a few weeks ago,)
and Blue Fred Wimberly.
Bryan never swung a crowd any
better than old Sam could do it,
when aroused and “in a weaving
way.” Blue Fred does not possess
the fiery eloquence which occasion
ally blazed up in the Old War Horse;
but, on the whole, his intellect is of
greater range and power, than was
dear old Brother Walker’s.
When we see elderly men who
have been kept off the public stage
by lack of learning or opportunity,
it ought to teach us a lesson. Tens
of thousands of the little boys of our
own white race are growing up, in
this country, neglected of the teacher
and preacher and charity-broker, and
philanthropist.
No Laymen’s Movement, with
elaborate banquets, speech-making,
singing and praying, is under way,
for the up-lift of the children of
America. Oh no! It is the children
of Korea that give us the belly-ache.
No monster-meetings of the pros-
perous business men of the United
States are storming the country, in
behalf of the million or more of il
literate, destitute and neglected boys
and girls of our own color and race.
Oh no! The children of China
and Japan are the ones that cause
us to harass every American congre
gation for more missionary money.
It is an outrage—an infernal shame
—an everlasting disgrace—a nation
al calamity—a menace, of thunder
ous emphasis, to our future!
Quit giving your money to the
preachers, until they promise to quit
their monstrous methods of doing
foreign missionary work.
And if the preacher condemns you
from the pulpit, quit going to hear
him until he comes to his senses, and
quits treading on your feelings.
And if you are threatened with ex
pulsion, defy that threat, also. The
pew has its rights, as well as the
pulpit. Stand up for yours, like a
man! T. E. W.
ENJOYS READING JEFFS HOME
MISSION TALK.
Dear Sir: —Though a mere youth
of nineteen years, I have become
deeply interested in your writings
and the grand work you are doing
throughout America for the benefit
of humanity. My father is a sub
scriber to your weekly Jeffersonian
and Magazine. I think you cover the
field thoroughly. All the vital ques
tions of the day are well discussed
in your papers.
I feel grateful we have such a
leader as you in our Southland, and
we need more such.
Mr. Watson, you express my senti
ments exactly on Foreign Missions,
Socialism, Capitalism, and Roman
Catholicism. I have given much at
tention to the study of the foregoing
subjects, and I find that you have
made them clearer for me than any
other writer has done. I enjoy read
ing your Home Mission talks. ’Tis a
pity so many of our good people are
far-sighted; they can see conditions
over there in China and other heath
en lands, but there is nothing doing
at home! lam almost persuaded at
times to believe that it is a species
of insanity prevailing. What’s to be
come of our home people? Must
they drift down into heathendom for
want of attention?
With best wishes,
Yours for reform,

IS A SUPPORTER OF THE JEFFS
IDEAS.
Dear Sir: —I have been reading
The Jeff since February, and am well
pleased with its contents. I have al
ways been an admirer of yours, and
will be with you from now on. Rela
tive to Foreign Missions: I have
made some contributions to them,
but will never pay another penny as
long as it runs as it does. The
settlement in which I live is thinly
settled by whites, and we have few
subscribers to the Jeffs. Being an
uneducated man, I can not do as
much as I would like. “Social
Equality” is one of the most damna
ble things on earth; to think, our
white people will congregate with
the blacks. I think the religion in
that crowd that gathered in the
courthouse of Dublin would not give
any man the headache. I have no
respect for such people. I will not
dwell longer on that subject. That
cussed Aldrich tariff should be wiped
from existence, and I intend to help
get it out by helping put men in of
fice that have some sympathy for the
laboring class. These are the ones
3effersoman
so greatly oppressed. I long to see
the day when we will be behind you
100,000 strong, and will knock the
bottom out of that big boat that
these men are sailing in.
Well, as this is my first time try
ing to write to The Jeff I guess I had
better come to a close, but haven’t
said half what I want to say; tongue
can’t express my felings. However,
I will do all I can for subscriptions
for The Jeff.
Yours truly, G. B. GIBSON.

THE ORIGINAL PLAN OF MISSION
WORK.
Dear Sir: —This is my first at
tempt to write, but I have seen so
much sentiment expressed of your
efforts to throw the light? into the
darkness of our land, to reveal to
us the real truths contained in the
Bible on Foreign Missions and to
show how far we have varied from
these truths, that I must say I am
with you also for the Truth, the
whole Truth, and nothing but the
Truth.
I have always felt it my duty to
give to Foreign Missions and when I
gave I gave in faith, and have been
partial to Foreign Missions. But I
now believe that you have published
the truth as it is. I believe that
everybody is called some time in life
to preach the Gospel, for we are com
manded, first, to live in Christ, then
hold Him up before the world that
He may draw all men unto Him. I
feel sure that if we do this it will not
be necessary to take the money from
the poor and needy at home and send
it across the sea that heathen might
live in luxury and ease, and confess
Christ in return.
If we are doing as Christ told the
twelve to do, as He sent them out by
twos to preach the Gospel, I do not
understand why there are so many
scattered sheep of the “House of
Why Should You

Israel” in our own land who never
heard of the Great Shepherd. These
men were were sent out with a com
mand to take no. extras with them,
but to leave the power in His hands.
They were to do nothing more than
tell that the Messiah had come and
the “Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”
Now, it seems to me that if we are
to furnish up-to-date schools, dispen
saries, orphanages, and dental sur
geons, etc., for their comfort, that
they may believe the Gospel, it shows
that we are attempting to take the
power and the glory away from God
to accomplish this Gospel mission
ourselves, and right there works
without faith is dead. For the same
reason that a boy will educate him
self after the desire is once aroused
in him, will the heathen educate
themselves if interest is once stirred.
If the power to change the heart is
with God alone, why should other ef
forts than preaching the Gospel avail
anything?
It is true, as one has already said,
great good is perhaps being accom
plished; but would not even more
good be accomplished if we exercise
more faith and use less money? My
Bible teaches me that Charity is
greater than Faith and Hope; then
