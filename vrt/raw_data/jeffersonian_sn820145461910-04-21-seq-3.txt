ing for the condition your land is in
at the end of the five years.
We will all agree that the sown
land is ahead at first of the culti
vated land.
Now, we will cross the road and
see what can be done over there.
This is the same grade of land when
I commenced on it a few years
ago. I had previously learned the
benefit of resting my land, so I be
gan sowing and manuring heavily
every year, and plowing deeper un
til I went from ten bushels of wheat
to forty-five bushels to the acre, and
from six hundred pounds of seed cot
ton to thirty-three hundred pounds
to the acre, or twelve hundred and
twenty-seven pounds of lint cotton
to the acre. This is a statement
some people don’t believe, but such
crops can be made, and I have the
proof. To show some farmers that
don’t learn to intensify their farm
ing and make more to the acre is a
mystery to me; some will say if you
will take the cost from these heavy
yields you won’t have any more
profit than you had from your aver
age land, well, let’s see, figure it out,
it cost me $23.50 per acre to make
forty-five bushels.
Cost of breaking land $ 2.00
Cost of fertilizing 6.00
Cost of five tons of manure. . 10.00
Cost of seed wheat 1.50

Now last and most important, is

with carefully selected, improved

This is due to deep plowing, ro
tating crops, and selected seed.
When you sow your land, first, you
rest it; second, you rest your stock;
third you rest yourself, and, on the
other hand, where you cultivate
your land continuously, you exhaust
it; second, you exhaust your stock
and yourself.
Now here is my experience as a
farmer.

Arguments Pro and Con Regarding
“Local” School Tax
AS TO LOCAL TAX FOR SCHOOLS.
Dear Mr. Watson:—ln The Jeffer
sonian of March 31st one Mr. J. R.
Brown, of Hampton, Ga., asked your
opinion, or advice, as to local tax for
schools.
As the most of cities and towns
have local tax for schools, we were
very anxious to find you heartily in
favor of local tax for country schools.
But we find from your answer that
you had not considered the matter;
yet you seem to be inclined towards
the opposing side.
It is not our purpose to try to
wrong you, or take up any great
amount of your valuable time. But,
as we are great believers in local tax
for country or rural schools, let us
reason together, and consider the
number of towns and cities that have
had local tax schools for years, and
it is very rare, if ever, that it is done
away with or voted out after once
being tried.
If it is good for town schools, why
not good for rural schools, too?
Haven’t many people moved to the
towns with the plea of getting such
school advantages? And haven’t
their boys learned to roll a cigarette
to perfection, part his hair exactly
in the middle; wear his hat side
ways; one corner of his ’kerchief out
of his side pocket? All ready to ad
vise any old man who chances his
way?
And haven’t the good women of
the country pleaded with their “hub
bies” to move to town? Where they
could get Mary Jane into a good
school and, incidentally, into society,
where she could keep up with the
latest styles? And haven’t they laced
and piled on the foolish fashions un
til they are out of shape and look
like an ad. in front of a Jew’s store?
From these causes are not our
people drifting, physically, morally,
socially, and not religiously, but
HELLWARDS?
The country maiden doesn’t have
to cage a poor bird to hear its songs,
but lives amid the songs of birds
where they build their nests and
sing their sweetest songs of freedom.
She lives in the open air that is fresh
from the fragrant flowers and puri
fied by the influence of vegetation;
she basks in the open sunshine and
the love of God, and develops into
the most perfect of all perfections,
so that the Great Creatoi' smiles ap
provingly, and when the angels look
down upon them they tune their
harps and sing a new song.
God has shown His dislike for
city people by destroying some of
the great cities. (And in one in
stance, you remember, poor old Mrs.
Lot, who looked back (possibly) to
seq what was the latest style, and got
left, poor thing!)
Isn’t it a fact that the greatest
men that we have account of were
raised in the country and educated in
the country schools? Men who
cheerfully yielded to the proclama
tion of God: that man should live by
the sweat of his brow.
Mr. Watson, I am not after a de
bate with you, I am only a poor old
countryman, and you know country
people haven’t much sense, any how,
and I know full well that I am not
in your class as a debater, and it
would be no credit to you to “clean
me up.”
As you are a man that I have
often loved to admire, and honor by
a vote when there was an opportunity
offered, I will take the privilege to
tell you if I see you get off of your
man, I insist that get back; and tell
Mr. J. R. Brown that you have taken
the case for Local Tax for country
schools. Tell him that it is so much
cheaper and better to put the
amount of money in our own home
community in employing good, com
petent teachers, and in hiring neat
and comfortable school houses, than
it is in sending our boys and girls
abroad and paying high board and
tuition away from home. And to
make country life more attractive
and inviting. Where our boys and
3tffersonian
girls may have the advantages of
parental care until they develop into
mature manhood and womanhood.
Mr. Watson, tell Mr. B. that local
tax does not harm any one, for every
dollar invested in school or church in
any community adds two dollars to
the surrounding property. It in
vites more enterprising people and a
better class of citizenry.
When we moved into this com
munity lands here were selling for
from two to seven dollars per acre,
but there was neither church nor
school.
We built a neat little schoolhouse
and we built a neat little house to
worship in, and we gave it to the
Lord —and voted for local tax. Now
our lands are worth from twenty to
fifty dollars per acre.
Tell Mr. B. that in every town and
community there are ‘“deadheads,”
drones in every hive, that are not
worth the little mound that will be
over their graves after they are
very, very dead, and the poor “we
have with us always.” But tell Mr.
B. that “If he can not give his thou
sands, and the heathens’ lands ex
plore, he can vote for local tax and
help the heathen at his door.”
Home missions, don’t you “C?”
Yes, we Jeffs have been taught
that way.
Yes, we have local tax and as good
teachers as the State affords; we are
content and happy.
Tell Mr. B. to write to Mr. Jere
M. Pound, S. S. C., Atlanta, Ga., and
that he will give him any informa
tion wanted and furnish him with
testimonials from a number of very
intelligent men from over the State,
and the S. S. C. will also send him
the school law.
Now, Mr. Watson, take this case
on to a finish, and your fee will be
that usual amount which you are ac
customed to enjoy, viz., a peace of
conscience for having done your
whole duty.
Yours respectfully,
Richland, Ga. W. W. JESTER.

—told them they did not have tax to
pay, and to vote for local school tax
and make the people who had the
property school their children. It
has ruined our rural schools. The
white children can’t go to school
now as much as before.
There is a negro school and a
white school on my place. Our white
school closed last week; the children
had to go to the farms. The negroes
are still running their schools, and it
is the case every year under the local
tax. People who ride from town to
town on the railroads and see the
town schools only, praise local school
tax, but the truth is it has put the
white country children in the field
and the negroes in school.

THOS. H. ANDREWS.
