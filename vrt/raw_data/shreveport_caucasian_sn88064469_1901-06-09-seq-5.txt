This popular State institution closed its
Situ seseion, June 4. with the best resord
of work and enrollment In the history of
the schoq1. Arriving seme time before the

visitors in their tour of lnsoection through
the building, going irst into the large,
well arranged reaoiag room, them to Ih
work she p and from there to the domestie
1iepa tment in the basement. An inteali
gent clever Kansas woman, Miss Earner,
is at the head of this important depart
ment In the sewing room were beautiful
specimens of hand and machine made
garmente, and fancy w irk. But the
kitchen, with its apo less t bles, polIshed

the most attraetive plane ia the building.

I For it is not so much the things we
have, but the pleasing way we wear
them, that matters.
Long and full at the feet is the skirt
in the visithig costume of the first
sketch, the gown being rendered in sky
ble enshnmere elaborately appliqued
and with blouse and elbow puifings in
white crinkled chiffon. The white par
asol is set off with rows of blue and
green ribbon. and the fancy straw hat
Is conspicuous for its tuft of pink and
white rdser
In costumes of general utility tbp
shirt waist is all powerful. Nothing,
In fact, surpasses the tasteful ahirt
waist and well fitting skirt for morn
ing wear. When completed with one
of 'the new shirt waist bats or a small
French sailor bat with m white lace
veil tied iato a paeefe"spot betad,
NM lave the typiesi A.berican woman
at once.
But the waist re frei to be very well
put on (that li to edcret of duAeess),
worn over a well fitting pair of corsets
and well pulled down and held in at
the waist. The best bdouses are most
simple, a slightly pouched shape over
a narrow waistband.
For morning wear there are the most
dainty cravats and collars in cambric,
anisbed off with stiff little bows, Inlet
Witb gpipure qt the edges.
A sketch shows a fashionable skirt
with sumcient amplitude round the
feet without the a44t1pn of the usual
volante en forme. It is quite easy to
make and looks weB to silk or cloth,
but is peirtlmasty recommended for
washing materials. The seams ire cut
exactly in the shape illustrated, each
seam slanting sharply outward in tn
angle from the knees on one side,
which gives a pretty fullness round the
bottom. The skirt is tight fitting round
the hips.
All that is best in dress is certainly
of a soft, clinging description, chiffon
and lace being perhaps more to the
fore than ever. The fron froze of the
fashionable woman can be beard from
afar, though there is no suggestion of
rustling silk.
Multiplicity of detail characterizes
all the new models. Open stitch ber
ringboning Is a favorite instance.
Seams Instead of being closely joined
are often united by this openwork a
quarter of an inch in width; showing
the contrasting silk lining underneath.

T '" '- qpretty running down the
seaws uw tue skirt in thin materials,
such as voile or gauze.
Voile I certainly the material par ex
cellence, pin spot voile being one of the
season's novelties.
Any light, semitransparent fabric is
fashionable for the more dressy tol
lets. leaving rough materials and linens
for morning wear.

Crravats of the same fabric as the

that shirt waists that are without them
look odd. The turnover edge embroid

finish to baste on the top of cravats to'

Marquise bracelets are th,. very nat
ural results of the resumption of short
sleeved evening gowns and elbow
sleeved afternoon eastames. A umar
quise'bracelet Is usually a rope of fex
ible thin ribbon of gold adorned with a
three t9 five Inch long cameo or min
lature framed in pearls or diamonds or
an ornament such as a crown of Jew
els, the Prfnce of Wales' three' feathers
or a Florentine Illy seemingly adjusted
to the gold Laud by a fluttering jeweled
ribbon bow. Whatever design may be
adopted, the setting must be in, the
long, marquise form, and against a
round, white arm the decorative value
of such a dazzling fetter Is undeniable,
remarks the New York Sun.
A New and Workable Notien.
A novel and very practical idea in
fancy work is to cut out a cretonne pat
tern and put It on another material
as applique decoration. A good thing
about this Is that any one with taste
and clever fingers can do it successful
ly, and if a good cretonne is chosen the
effect is very pretty. The sketch in
black and white gives only the faintest
idea of the work, for the coloring Is
the chief beauty.
The background of the present ex
ample Is black velvet, which forms

TONN E
rather a striking contrast to the red
roses. All the outlines of the flowers
are finished ii gold thread. Where
the stalks in the cretonne are too thin
to cut out embroidery is introduced to
fill the spaces. The effect of this ap
plique cretonne is very rich. As to the
actual method of working, the cretoune
or sateen is laid upon the material in
tended for the background and is tack
ed down all round the lowers and
leaves and buttonhole stitched and the
other material then cut away. The
background may be made of almost
any material.
