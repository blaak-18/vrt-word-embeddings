FRIDAY, MAY 3, 1!95.
IIoll fast to the three fundamental
principles embodied in the Omaha plat
form-finance, transportation and land.
LoOKOctr for the morement to put
delegates in the next national conven
tion woho do not indorse the Omaha
platform.

Populists who don't believe in a
single plank platform are turning
the hose loose on the single plank

going to get wet.

An exchange wants to know
"why Republican and Democratic
farmers will give two and one-half
bushels of wheat for one dollar?"
That's "dead easy"'--to make the
"dollar good in Y urrop."
I anm asked by a railroad wage
slave who has been awakened to
his condition, if I can point to one
instance in history where tyranny
has ever submitted to any argu
ment except force. And if I can
not, why go On teaching the effica
cy of the ballot. I have read of
no instance where the classes have
given up the privilege of living off
the people except by force of arms,
but I also see that no success by
force has ever been of any lasting
benefit to the masses. There are
other factors entering into the
present struggle that were not
present in any previous ones. Chief
of these is the ability of the mass
es to read and write, making a
propagands of ideas instead of
brute force; second, a broader
freedom of speech and press; third,
the oppressed have a franchise
equal to the rich. But more even
than all this is the prominent fact
that until men can be educated
enough to see the tyranny and vote
against it, the idea of fighting
against it is absurd. One duty is
to agitate and get people discon
tented with the present conditions
by showing that a better one can be I
had. When the maies understand
this a change will occur. As my
qdestioner ha got his eyes open by
reading, so will others have their
eyes opened by reading, and when
that sentiment has grown sufficient
y no force can suppress it.-Com- ]

Why it RLalned.
HIaving decided to postpone other
busirness and attond the wanrd 9 Pop
ulist club meetinz at Melrose, we
were at the depot Saturday morn
ing "on time," hnd after swapping
a few phrases with the polite and
Saffable conductor, Mr. A. L.
: Denys, we complied with his "all
0o aboard." and was soon whirling
;; rapidly along toward our destina
tion.
We stopped at Bayou Natchez
Sstation long .enoueh to chat a few
moments with our friend M. L.
o Payne, and to "shake hands" with
those clever Natchez merc',ants
TMessrs. Friedman and Jaffa.
"_ Arriving at Cypress a little
ahead of time, we began to look
Sfor items of interest. The first
:, was a neatly painted sign hanging
on the front of what used to be a
r saloon, but the sign read in large
bold letters, "Keely Cure." As
prohibition has not yet gone into
Seffect, we supposed the change was
due to the prosperity that is every
where evident under the Gold
standlard.
But casting our eyes over on the
porch of Mr. J. C. Johnson's beau
i tiful residence, we saw a prettier
t- picture still---one of his daughters,
Sa pupil, and Miss Lelia Hlolston,
t the teacher of the Cypress school.
T. Tinking Miss Lelia would like to
a hear the latest news from Natchi
toches, her home, we walked over
and told her that her "folks" had
not yet taken the measles, nor had
g Natchitoches quarantined against
:- Cypress on account of the small
s pox. She reported her school in a
flourishing condition.
The rumbling of the regular
passenger on the T. P., called us
If back to the depot in time to get the
morning Shreveport Times, and
e before we had finished it our clev
er and punctual friend, Mr. R. O.
Walters, showed up in good order
to fulfill his promise to "make eon
e nection" between Cypress and Mel
rose.
But by this time the long-wished
for rain that had been promising
and tantalizing the farmers for sev
e eral days began to pour down in
I real earnest, and we took comfort
in being under roof, andi passed off
Yseveral hours chatting with the
pleasant agents at the station.
a About 1:30 p. m., the rain ceas
t ed and the clouds looked broken
f and light as if the sky were about
to peep through, and we took a
Sseat beside Mr. Walters on a good
r stout jumper, drawn by a pretty
3-year old colt of his own raising,
which he was just "breaking,"
which accounted for the jumper in
i stead of a top-buggy, but we had
Sa good umbrella that we s.oon found
r the most useful part of our "rig,"
for the dark clouds soon whipped
back from wherever they had gone
and gave the hardest rain of the
Iday. So you can clearly see that
it would have been raining yet if
it had not sooner got an opportu
nity to give ye editor a good soak
ing. By means of the umbrella,
however, we confined the wetting
to the largest part of our body-
our feet, and that fast-trotting colt
soon landed us safely into the com
fortable and well-regulated home
of our friend, where we were ush
ered into a warm room in which a
fire and a change of raiment soon
dispelled all idea of dampnees 1
Next we joined Mr. Waiters and I
his accomplished better half in the
dining room where an elegant re-I
pat had been prepared by the I
skilful hand oft this good lady.
While we were disappointed over
the failure of the young folks' pie- I
aic ad the club meeting that were
intended to make the day interest
lag and enjoyable, we could not
complan of the cause-the much
needed rain. And as the mia
uhic we enjoyed at Mru Walters'
bmatifuL M.c~ld not be sar- .

remember, and our l,leaant anti
cipations were more than realized.
After a refreslhin:; sl-ep and an
early, but appetising breakfast,
we bade the entertaining family
adieu. and ;hrouhii the kindness of
our hoet, reached Brevelle in time
for the North bound train on the
N. & H. R. V. road. Aboard
11
were Col.''. I). .Boyd and Prof.
Bg . ('. ('aldwell, of our Normal,
nearly all the prominent men of
Bayou Natchez and other distin
guished personages (like ourself)
whose names we did not learn,
with the usual complement of ho
tel drummers and hack boys.
At the depot we took Deveren
nes' "buss" and was soon in Char
k ley Tucker's famous shaving par
t lors, reading the latest papers and
waiting our "turn" at the lather
a and strap.
Shortly afterward we reported
at headquarters and gave an ac
count of ourself to our better two
thirds.
Intrinsle Value,
d -
BATON ROUGE. LA,
c April 24th, 195. .
- Editor LA. PorULIST:
r Your fellow-townsman, Mr. Cos
grove, has given us a good article
in the Times-Democrat on this sub
' ject, something in line with the
one I had just sent you bearing on
o the subject. Since the attempt is
i- being made to surrender our lpeo
pr ple into the hands of a gold trust
d by the trusted servants of the peo
d pie it is necessary to go to thf bot
tom of this finance question and
it settle it rightly and for all time.
I- As the intrinsic value has long
a since beeoon abandoned in theory, it
must now be discarded in practice.
It is out of t'e lines of reason and
r can only have a foothold in tradi
8 tion and supcrstition.
e What is value? A creature of
d the mind; an invisilble, intangible
entry; the offspring of circum
stances and conditions growing out
of the ordinary atfair4 of life, and
r the relations arising t;erefrom and
- becoming existent between men
- and things. For instance; iron,
which in itself, and independently
of man, could be of no use and
- therefore, could have no value, be
r comes in the various uses to which
- it is put and applied by man, ex
tremoly useful and valuable. The
same may be said of gold; but
Webster in illustrating the mean
ing of the word value, declares
a that iron has really more value
than gold.
Economists tell us what value is
not; but they doe not tell us what
it is. An affirmative definition of
t value is what we want. Value, as
Mr. Cosgrove tells us, is not an
entity inherent within a thing
but, is extraneous to the thing,
and arises from the uses to which
the thing may be applied by man.
Value, therefore, can not be inhe
rent or intrinsic with the thing,
but the properties which serve to
make a thing useful to man, and so
impart to it value, must be inhe
rent or intrinsic within the thing.
I It follows then that while iron,
gold, silver, wheat and corn, and 1
many other things have a value at
taching to them ,v reason of pro
perties within t[lem, and which I
render them susceptible to use by I
man, they, none of them possess
intrinsic value, and as a rule, the
degree of value which may attach I
to any particular thir'1 from ex
traneous causes, will depend upon
the time, labor and skill required
to produce the thing taken in con
nection with the quantity of pro
duct and demand for it in use.
While iron is more useful, more
essential to the needs of man, and I
more in use than gold, and ,:onse
quently really more valuable, gold t
takes on a much greater fictitious
value, because of the fact that it
has been elevated to the position of <
an exclusive medium of exchange V
by law; and the credulity andl su- I
perstitions of man have been fur
ther worked upon to ele, ate it to
the character of a "Rodeemer."
Gold is no god on whose altar
should be sacrified millions of in- a
nocent, helpless women and chil- I
dren, victims of mans vice or in
capacity to govern.
Yours, truly,
o J. T. HOWELL. t

d!the present fine weather continue.
We have always had an over pro
duction of one product in this
country, and I fear it is going to
continue, and that is an orer pro
º- duction of fools who allow their
minds to be warped by party pre
judice to such an extent that they
cannot go to the polls andt east an
intelligent ballot for Home and
good Government. It does seemn
that the time of party prejudice
should be lost sight of for all time
to come, and the people learn one
lesson, and that to vote for their
1 own interest.
r The question of the distribution
of wealth is now up for settlement
1 and you have got to vote it fight
or shoot riglht, and if this confiding
Speople continue to vote in the fu
ture ias in the past. the latter is the
most likely to follow. We are
surely on the high seas of financial
ruin, and every day carries us fur
ther away from the shore.
Ignorance and servitude go hand
in hand, aind no densely ignorant
people can long remain free. The
plutocrats of this nation have read
hist,rvy and know from tlhe past

1Honest Democrats.
In Jackson parish the predom
inancy of the Populist is conced
ed, the result of the late congres
Isional election establishing this
fact, and in the next election they
will have full swing in selecting
parish officers, as the l)emocracy
of the parish, aware of the situa
tion, will make no fight over these
positions, content to lend whatever
aid we can to swell the vote of the
State officials, and the opportuni
ty will now be granted to our Pop
ulist brethren to give us a term of
the reform government, they so
loudly demand.
Largely in the majority, the
right of selecting is justly yours
and we will concede the point, and
will stoically stand by while you
exercise your prerogative, well
aware of the hopelessness of any
contest in the face of an establish
ed majority. At the same time
trusting that wisdom and inteli
gence will be used in the selection
of officers, and that good and com
petent men will be chosen to ad
mminister our local government for
the next four years.
So go in Joseph, the pie is yours;
we have had our term and will take
a back seat some other day to come
sgain.--Jacksonian.
Bro. Bell and his Democratic
supporters in Jackson parish are
honest, and as they are willing
that the people should rule, they
are true Democrats.
There are many Democrats in
this parish (Natchitoches) who like
their brethren in Jackson, are wil
ling that the people should rule,
and taking the result of the elec
tion last Fall-nearly 50( wHrr
majority for the Populists-they
concede the parish and all of its
offices to the People's party; and
many of these honest Democrats
will join us in selecting good men
to fill these offices.
But we regret to state that there
are those-call them what you
may-who under the silly pretext
that many of their kind staid away
from the polls last Fall and that
they just let us win, are laying
their plans to revive the old er at of
fraud, perjury and corruption of
the ballot.
When we consider the fact that
attemps to use such methods tn de
fet the will of a large majority of
the intelligent White people of this <
pariah will produce revolution and 1
bloodshed, the conspirators and all
those who favor such violations
of all law and public mobrals, should
be looked upon as anarchist, and
diaounanoad in asociy as I
ulss threto.t
lHowever. we believe that a lIa
jorit v of the opposition to 1Popu
listu in thi- parish Hill agree v;ith
Sthe ni:rnly and platriotic p-liti, n of
the .lJ k.onian as eoxl,r-used in theI

)Dear Sir:--I wrote you recently
that I was glad to see the move
menat to harmlonizc all elements fa
t voring honest methods in polities
' in the approaching campaign. I
' had reference only to the supposi
t lion that all parties shall azree on

r ticipate in a Democratic primary
without surrendering our honesty
i and self respect, or abandoning our
t party organization. In case the
t l)emocrats will not agree to a white
j primary, we must tight in a minor
ity until dishonest practices and
e corruption and abuses of the Dem
e ocrats drive enough honest white
men into our ranks to enable us to
beat them at the polls, and then
whip them if they count us out.

Populist Club,
t
Battle Flag.
Last Saturday a Populist Cen
r tral Club was formed in Robeline.
- This club is organized for the pur
Spose of distributing educational
I matter among the people of the
r sixth ward. W. V. Page was
elected President, J. A. Tetts see
, retary, C. J. Smith treasurer. A
resolution pamsed, making each
t member of the club a committee
of one, to enroll the names of the
populists who will join this club,
t olution was adopted admitting all
over 18 years of age to member
ship in the club. After some gen
eral discussion the club adjourned
to meet again on the first Saturday
in May at 2 o'clock.
J. A. TErra, Secretary.
That's right, boys. Organize,
so that when the Democrats at
tempt counting us out, as they
sometimes threaten, we can make
it hot for them.
Gov. Foster and Ballot Reform.
It is currently rumored that
Murphy J. Foster, Governor of
Louisiana, will, within the next
few days, through the medium of
some personal friend, make a state
ment to the people of this State in
which it is proposed to show the
ardent devotion of the Governor
to the matter of Ballot Reform.
This is a case of "blowing hot and
cold," and The Item anxiously
awaits this statement, and will give
it the attention which the great
importance of the subject demands.
The people are in earnest on the
question of improved suffrage.
They were thwarted at the last ses
sion of the legislature through the
machinations of their executive,
and are not now in the humor to
be trifled with any longer. Since
May 1894, Governor Foster has
played a star engagement as Jekyll
and Hyde, giving the promise of
Ballot Reform to the ear, only to
break it to the hope. It is time
that the responsibihity be fastened
where it belongs.
The man who so completely dom
inated the legislature as to force it
to select, in a single night, two
United States Senators of his own
choosing, could unquestionably I
have afforded some assistance to
advance ballot reform had he had
the least inclination in this direc
tion. It is puerile to think other
wise. True, he did elaborate upon
this subject in his message to the
legislature, but subsequent events
show the utter insincerity of his
recommendations. It was mockery.
That famous committee of four
teen, composed of members of the
Senate and House, to whom all
questions of suffrage were prompt- a
ly referred, was his- creation No a
member of this committee could
have been appominted unless author- '
ized and accepted by the Governor,
and it is a fact worthy of mention
that every ballot reformer in
the legislature, including Senator
Montgomery, Representative Be
noit and others equally prominent, s
was excluded from appointment on
this committee. Every ballot re- 1
form measure sent to this commit
tee was strangled, and every ballot
reformer delegated by the league a
of this city to appear before the s
committee in the interest of this 0
great cause received but feele en
couragement. Who doubts but a
that results would have been differ
ent had only the Governor of the
State so desired?
But we wait an explanation, s
shortly expected from the execu
tive or some representative friend,
before entering into aditicual de
tails.--Daily ltem.
