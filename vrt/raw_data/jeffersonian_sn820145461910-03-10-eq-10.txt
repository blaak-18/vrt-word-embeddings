OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM '
TWO NEW FRIENDS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here come two
little Georgia girls. We are eleven
and thirteen years old. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian and the Magazine,
and we like to read The Jeffersonian
and the Magazine, and the Post-Card
Club. We live on a farm, and do not
think we would like to live in town.
We go to school every day we can.
Our teacher’s name is Miss Gertrude
Crayton. She lives about a mile
from us. We will answer some of
the riddles asked by the boys and
girls. The answer to Carlyle Giles’
is: One man had five sheep and the
other seven. The answer to tide oth
er riddle is a wheelbarrow. We
think the answer to Zeenie Huff’s
riddle is a pair of firedogs, and the
answer to Dewey Campbell’s riddle
is Tom Watson’s weekly Jefferson
ian. We will ask a riddle; Two
legs sat upon three legs, with one
leg is his lap; in came four legs, ran
away with one leg; up jumps two
legs, catches up three legs, throws
them at four legs, and makes four
legs brink one leg back. To all who
answer this riddle, we will send a
post-card.—Your new friends, Willie
and Eva Sullivan, Silver Creek, Ga.,
Rt. 1.
GET YOUR BIBLES.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. As it was raining and snow
ing today, and I could not go to
school, I thought I would write to
The Jeffersonian. I have just been
reading the letters from the Post-
Card Club, and I noticed one where
Florence Smith said she wanted the
Club to write questions on the Bi
ble, and quit asking riddles. I think
that would be much better. I will
answer one of her questions: Moses
was one hundred and twenty years
old when he died. He died on Mount
Nebo. Let me ask you some ques
tions: No. I—When the first alarm
of the trumpet was given, which
tribes marched first? No. 2 —Who
fasted forty days and nights? No. 3
—How old was Hezekiah when he
began to reign? No. 4—How many
titles does Isaiah attribute to the
Lord Jesus? I think I can answer
Sarah Ponder’s riddle: No. I— A
yard gate. No. 2—Fire-tongs. The
answer to Miss Flossie Jackson’s
riddle is a cow-bell. I will close,
with best wishes to The Jefferson
ians.—Willie Hutcheson, Temple,
Ga., Rt. 3.
ANSWERS TO RIDDLES.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you ad
mit a little girl eleven years old, in
your band of boys and girls? Papa
takes both of your papers. He is
also an agent; he sent off six sub
scribers this week. I live in the
country and like it very much. My
father is a farmer. He raises cot
ton, corn, potatoes and syrup. I will
answer some of the riddles asked last
week. Zeenie Huff’s was fire-dogs.
The answer to Carlyle Giles’ was a
churn. The answer to Stella Faires’
was air. Now I will ask one: Down
in the garden was a little green
house, and in that little green house
there was a little white house, and
in that little white house there was
a little red house, and in the little
red house there was a lot of little
negroes. I have three sisters and
three brothers.—Your new friend,
Delia Coggin, Brooks, Ga., Rt. 1.
RUSS AND JAP.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little North Georgia girl to join
your happy band. Papa takes The
Jeffersonian, and thinks Mr. Watson
is a smart man. I will describe my
self. I am a little girl, eight years
old; have blue eyes, light hair, fair
skin, and weigh ninety pounds. I
live on a farm, two miles from town.
Papa raises cotton, corn, wheat and
oats, peas and potatoes. I think the
answer to Stella Faires’ riddle Is
©h* Tleffcrsonlan
smoke. I will ask some riddles:
Who was the fastest runner in the
world? Why did the Russian sol
dier wear brass buttons on his coat,
and the Japanese soldier wear steel
ones on his coat? To the one that
gives the correct answer to these, I
will send a post-card. With best
wishes to Mr. Watson and the Post-
Card Club,. I remain, Jeromie El
liott, Hiram, Ga., Rt. 2.
HOW MANY CATS WERE THERE?
Here comes a little Georgia boy
who wishes to enter your Post-Card
Club. Papa takes The Jeffersonian,
and likes to read it very much. I
am eleven years old; am going to
school and am in the fifth grade.
My teacher is Miss Rosa Callahan. I
hope to see this in print. I shall an
swer some of the riddles. The an
swer to Zeenie Huff’s is a pair of
andirons. Easter Matthews’ is the
whale that swallowed Jonah. Car
rie Lewis’ is a blackberry. Now I
shall give some: There was a room
with eight corners, a cat in every
corner; -seven cats in front of each
cat, and a cat on each cat’s tail; how
many cats were there? I will close,
with best wishes to Daddy Jim, and
The Jeffersonian. — Your new friend,
Grady Mangham, Thunder, Ga.
BIBLE QUESTIONS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you ad
mit a little Mississippi girl into your
happy band? It seems that there
are not many letters coming from the
little folks down in this part of the
State. Hello, Miss Smith! I ap
prove of your plan of leaving off the
riddles and taking up Bible ques
tions. I think they will be more in
teresting to some of us, if not all,
and probably do more good. I will
answer one of your questions. I
think Moses was one hundred and
twenty years old. Well, I guess I
had better close and leave space for
some one who can probably write a
more interesting letter. I will go by
asking a question: What Bible char
acter was the father and grandfather
of his children? Good-bye.—Verna
Boydston, Plattsburg, Miss.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
Dear Daddy Jim:—This is the
first time we have written to the
Post-Card Club. Papa takes The
Jeffersonian, and likes it very much.
This is a cold and stormy day, has
been snowing and sleeting. The
earth and trees are all decorated
with ice. Papa made us stay in the
house all day. We are two small
active boys, seven and nine years
old, in the first and second grades.
We love our teachers very much.
Their names are Misses Angie and
Annie May Burden. We have about
sixty pupils. We like to go to
school very much. We play ball.
We have a good Sunday-school and
like to go very much. Will close,
with best wishes for The Jefferson
ian.—Clay and J. T. Seymour, Bow
man, Ga., Rt. 2.
ANOTHER TOM WATSON BOY.
. Dear Daddy Jim:—We are staunch
friends to Tom Watson. The Jeffer
sonian is our favorite paper. I am
dead-anxious to hear Mr. Watson 1
speak. Father and mother have
heard him. I have never been to
school, except five weeks last win
ter. Mother teaches me at home. I
am eleven years old and am in the
fifth grade. When I get through at
home, I am going to the Agricultural
College. I am always ready to tell
people that I am named for Tom
Watson. What is the first thing a
gardener sets in his garden? Why
is Ireland likely to grow rich?—
Yours very truly, Thos. E. Drake,
Bethlehem, Ga.
AFRAID OF THE BASKET.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
for the first time. I see so many
writing that I couldn’t put it off any
longer. I have black eyes and dark
complexion, and dark hair. I will
answer Florence Smith’s Bible ques
tions. Moses was 120 years old, and
was buried in the Land of Moab,
over against' Betheror. I will ask
her a Bible question: Who was the
second son of King David; what was
his name? What was the name of
the mother of King Solomon? I
think myself they had better quit
asking riddles, and ask something
else. We think there is no paper
like The Jeffersonian. I am afraid
of that basket. —Dennie Self, Thom
aston, Ga., Rt. 5.
