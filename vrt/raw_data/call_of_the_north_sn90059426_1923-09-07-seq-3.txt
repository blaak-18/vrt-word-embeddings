s he SON SPOT
A MESSAGE TO FATHER
In every boy’s heart there is a
spot. It may be more prominent or
pronounced in some boys than in
others. It may be a deep, silent long
ing in some hearts, and in others it
may find expression in a frank,
whole-hearted, boisterous, good fel
lowship. But it is there. For the
lack of a better name, and I doubt if
there is a better, I call it a “pal”
spot.
That spot in the boy’s heart keeps
growing with the boy, and, as he de
velops into manhood, it keeps calling
until it receives a response that fully
satisfies. If I had not answered that
call from my boy’s heart, he would
have gotten the answer from some
other boy or some other boy’s father;
and, too late, I would have awak
ened to a realization that I was miss
ing the one great privilege of my life
by not being a “pal” to my boy.
In due course our boy made his ap
pearance. When he arrived, his fa-,
ther resolved that he would make him
his pal. He was determined that no
boy or man should usurp that place
in his boy’s life. Of course the boy
could be chummy with his mother and
sisters, that was their right and pri
vileges, and it was duly cultivated
and enjoyed. He could have his
friends and playmates a plenty; but
for his pal, that place was claimed
by his daddy, and he counted the cost,
and was ready to pay the price.
Play Square With the Boy
As the boy grew older I found him
ready to meet me more than half
way on every proposition that gave
him a part in the game, and we be
came real pals. He played square
with me and I played a square game
with him. I found that he was not
just a mischievous scamp who wore
holes in his stockings, soiled the
towels, and ate everything in reach.
He was a human being with muscle
and bone and an understanding. He
wanted to do things,—wanted to
learn. He was a son of his father.
He was my boy. He wanted a father.
He just naturally wanted a pal that
he could go to for counsel, for knowl
edge, for help in the very same prob
lems and perplexities that his father
wanted help in when he was of that
age.
The boy is now twelve years old,
and the other evening we were walk
ing home from the office, where we
frad been on a late errand The
conversation was on an item of mu
tual interest in business and recrea
tion combined. I swung my left arm
across the lad’s back and let my hand
rest on his left shoulder. Immediate
ly his right hand went up to my right
shoulder, even (though he had to
stretch for it. After a few efforts I
succeeded in dislodging a troublesome
lump that had made its appearance in
my throat. I realized anew that my
boy and I were pals.
He was three years old when we
first noticed in him a hankering to do
things. We were having a new house
built, and the wife and I had gone
over to see how the work was pro
gressing. Of course the boy and his
little hammer went along. Our at
tention was directed elsewhere, and
the wife looked back just in time to
see a little white hed disappear be
tween two floor joists. He had tried

to make the step like the big folks,
but his legs were not quite long
enough. When we got around to the
basement entrance, we saw him
crawling up the incline, hammer in
hand, occasionally rubbing the back
of his head. A few days afterward
I had gone up the ladder to the roof
to talk with the shingler. A few
minutes later we heard a little noise
in the direction of the ladder, and
there was a little head and chest in
view, and a small voice said, “Me
want to help, too, papa.” He wanted
to do everything he saw anyone else
do, and was ready to try. You see
he was just a normal boy. He only
needed to be taught,—needed to be
guided. '
As he grew older he wanted to
make things,—tables, chairs, etc., —
for his little sister, three years
younger. His little saw would get
the parts all fixed for him, but they
would not fit together just right.
Then he would come up from his lit
tle workshop in the basement, and
lay the situation before his pal.
Down to the basement they would
go, those “two big boys,” (for that
was what they always called each
other when working together.) New
pieces would be secured where neces
sary, and the job soon completed.
Then the radio game came on. He
wanted a So we “chipped in.”
We always do, we two boys. He got
his wire and parts and put them to
gether, but the thing wouldn’t work.
Then he came to his pal for help.
But that was a new thing for his fa
ther, who soon discovered that you
can’t just look at a coil of wire and a
few rig-a-ma-gigs and solder them
together and get the desired results.
I saw that if I was to hold my rec
ord with that boy, it was for me to
master the amateur radio game.
He had the journals and I went at
it. After a few evenings I knew a
few of the things by their first names,
and thought I could connect up the
set for him. Together we worked one
evening, rewinding coils, and finally
had the set completed. We hooked
it up, but all we could coax out of
that aerial was what the boy called
“static.” I’ll not soon forget the look
in that bey’s face when he realized
that, for the first time in his experi
ence, something his pal had made for
him had failed to accomplish that for
which it was designed. We both
agreed that it was put together ac
cording to specifications. The next
day a new crystal was secured to re
place the one in the set, still nothing
but that static came to our ears. A
finer adjustment, however, soon
brought the music, but it was the boy
who was tinkering with the set at the
time results were obtained.
It may be arithmetic, or carpentry,
or radio, or boats, or bicycle, or rol
ler-skate or coaster repairs; what
ever it is, the boy goes as far as he
can. Then he knows, when he has
reached his limits, he can get help
from his pal. That help is never
denied him.
Stepping in Daddy’s Tracks 1
The teaching is not all one-sided.
It is about fifty-fifty, I think. A few
years ago we were walking down the
street. He tried to catch step with
THE CALL OF THE NORTH
me, but I am a six-footer and he
Was only ten years old. I shortened
my step and began to whistle a mili
tary march. He joined in the march,
with shoulders back and heels snap
ping. Then he said, “We’re keeping
step, Diaddy.” Keeping step with
father! That is still filtering. It
challenges me for a pace well chosen.
Last winter we were on our way
home, tracking through the snow. I
was in the lead, with my usual stride.
Then I heard, “I’m stepping right in
your tracks, Daddy.” Following in
his father’s footsteps! That means
not a single misstep of that father
for the son to follow. That lesson
is still soaking in.
For some time he has been talk
ing about getting a job during vaca
tions. He wants to work and earn
more money,—wants to do the thing
himself. He wants something steady.
I think of the stationery and the time
my secretary and I spend in writing
letters of recommendation for other
fathers’ boys. My boy is worth a lit
tle of my time. Not that I find the
job for him, but we have had several
chats as to manner of approach and
conduct. Last summer he burst into
the house, all excitement. He had
been on a trip to the community gro
cery for his mother, and came home
with the announcement that the gro
ceryman wanted him to deliver with
his bicycle. He had made the sale
himself, and he “was a happy lad.
I made an appointment to meet
him at home one day at 4:30, and did
not disappoint him, even though it
inconvenienced me at the time. At
another time he made an appointment
with me at the office for five o’clock,
but he stopped a few minutes with
a boy friend and was late. He had
to wait another day for his new keds,
but he appreciated the situation.
He was down at the plant one day,
with a number of neighbor children.
Hearing suppressed voices outsides, I
looked, and discovered him sitting
astride another boy, holding his
hands. He was sent home. I ar
rived home as usual, but nothing was
said about the episode until bedtime,
then he and I, in our pajamas, step
ped into his bedroom for a little chat.
This particular boy had been chiding
him about his friendliness toward one
of the girls, and, the girl being pres
ent, they were both quite embarrass
ed. The next evening, when I return
ed home, he greeted me with the an
nouncement that he and Bob had
made up. When questioned as to how
it had been brought about, he said,
“I went down and stuck out my hand
and said, ‘Come on, Bob, let’s shake,’
we bottl grinned, and it’s all
right.” He had followed counsel.
Proud of His Muscle
The other evening I had beaten
him into bed. He came into my roonf,
dressed in the lower part of his paja
mas, his trunk being bare. He walk
ed up to the bed, and, with his face
aglow, wanted me to feel his muscle.
There he stood, a miniature Jess
Willard. He then showed me how the
athletes stand when they have their
pictures taken. Many a time he and
his pal may be found in bed together
early in the evening, his daddy’s head
on his arm, talking over the events of
the day, and plans for the future.
That evening is lost, from the popular
viewpoint, but it is of priceless worth
from the pal standpoint.
At certain times during the year,
I am required to spend several weeks
away from home. On these occa
sions, when taking my departure, the
boy and I have a confidential chat
together. My appeal to him is after
this fashion: “Now, son, Daddy is
to be gone several days. There will
be no father here to look after things.
You are my big boy, and I can only
leave the responsibilities with you.
You will have to watch and see that
everything is all right. Mother will
need your help, because Daddy will
not be here. We will have to depend
on you. You will have to take my
place. Be a big boy and see that
everything goes all right. We will
depend on you, mother and I.” His
answer to me usually is, “All right,
Daddy, I’ll do it,’’ and the little man
seems to sense his position, and he
seems to grow just a bit taller, and
he walks around with his shoulders
back, just like us grown-ups. When
I return from the trip there is, invari
bly, a good report of his conduct.
It would not be fair to him to tell
of many of our chats over purely per
sonal affairs. Those interviews are
confidential. We have pledged each
other to play fair and square in eve-
rything. We are real pals, this boy
and I. He is not too small for me,
neither am I large for him. May it
never be otherwise. May the time
never come when he cannot come to
me with his problems, his perplexi
ties, his confidences, and find me in
a mood for an open and consistent
hearing. I have time for kites, fish
ing, a few minutes catch with the ball
before dinner, hikes, with camp fires,
boiled eggs and roast potatoes, with
this boy of mine. He is worth it.
Punch Him in the Ribs
Some day your boy will take the
initiative in the game. A few years
later he will be competing with a
million other fathers’ sons in the busi*
ness game, while you may be a
spectator. See that he gets started
right. Coach him now to win. Make
your boy your pal. It will pay y<
to go more than half-way, if neces
sary, but, if he sees the right disposi
tion on your part, he will meet you
before you get there. It will surprise
you how quickly he will begin to carry
the load, if you give him half a
chance. Whatever you do, play fair
with him.
Does your boy ever want to sit on
his dad’s lap ? Does he grab you
around the thighs and lift your hun
dred and eighty pounds into the air
jusi to show you how stout he is?
Does he ever measure himself on your
vest buttons? Does he ever tie your
pajamas into knots, and stuff things
into the toes of your shoes, when you
do the same for him? Does he ever
throw his arms around your neck and
put a kiss on your cheek, —an expres
sion of love, confidence, respect, trust,
and loyalty that is far above any
thing that this world has to offer?
Does your boy walk up to you, with
a twinkle in his eye, and square him
self for a playful sparring match?
Does he ever lock holds and challenge
you to go to the carpet with him for
a tussle? Does he ever drive into
you and muss up your hair? Do you
ever come back at him in the same
way ? Do you ever give him a
squeeze, punch him in the ribs, and
slap him on the shoulder just like real
pals? Do you ever show your love
and respect for him and your con
fidence and interest in him in any
other way than by a casual notice
or relunctantly handing him a few
dollars to spend?
Or, is he just the ordinary youth
whose father is too busy making a
few paltry dollars to know that he
has a son of his own, —a possible and
probable rival in the business game,
a few years hence?
The Rod and the Pal
Paling your boy is a real tonic. It
is a good recipe for keeping yourself
young. It will show him that he is
part of the family. It will solve
many of the problems, difficulties, and
perplexities in the administration of
home affairs in which he is interested.
Through that intimate association, he
will get a correct vision of the re
sponsibilities of home and business
and national life.
The wise man said, “Spare the rod
and spoil the child.” That is the way
with disciplinarians, but he only said
part of it. You can get away from a
lot of that rod stuff, and make a real
man out of your boy, if you will just
be a genuine, whole-hearted pal to
him. Probably, nine chances to one,
it is not a rod that -L he boy needs, as
much as he needs a father with a
little of the milk of human kindness
in his heart, and an understanding
and appreciation of the boy spirit.
You experience an enjoyable con
sciousness of pride and satisfaction
as you develop the association and tie
the bands of palship a little tighter as
the son grows older. If you have
been delinquent in this, and want to
test out your tact and diplomacy,
tackle that boy of yours.
He is the best pal I have ever had,
or ever expect to have, and I do not
know that I want a better, —is my
own son. I have paid the price, and
how cheap is that price! It is not
reckoned in coin and chattels, but it
is counted in something that will
mean more to him in the ultimate, my
time.
Can I be his pal when he is twenty
and in college? Can I still be his
pal when he enters upon life's new
problems at twenty-five? My body is
worthy, and he is worth my time and
closet, most intimate palship.—The
Watchman Magazine.

How to Keep a Man’s Love.
A young woman who thought she
was losing her husband’s affections
went to a seventh daughter of a sev
enth daughter for a loVe powder.
The mystery woman told her: “Get a
raw piece of beef, cut flat, about an
inch thick. Slice an onion in two,
and rub the meat on both sides with
it. Put on pepper and salt, and toast
it on each side over a red coal fire.
Drop on it three lumps of butter and
two sprigs of parsley and get him to
eat it” The young wife did so, and
her husband loved her ever after.
The Blood of White America
-K-K
IT MUST BE KEPT PURE AND UNCON
TAMINATED.
Diversity is Deity’s delight. You
cannot find two leaves exactly alike
upon the same tree, nor two roses
exactly alike upon the same bush.
The same is true of human beings.
All belong to the one species, but
there are myriad races and types.
The main need is to keep pure and
unmixed, in the human kingdom, the
superior and N all-conquering group of
the White. There is but one species
of man, with numerous races and
countless crossings, the latter pro
ducing the hybrid and the mongrel.
l The great purpose of the Ku Klux
Klan is to preserve in America, as
far as possible, the purity and power
of the White Race, to keep our coun
try from becoming a vast Mongrelia.
This is the basic purpose, under the
Sacred Obligation.
Mongrels a Menace
- It was high time for the effort to
be made. Mongrel hordes already
have flooded our country, until
groups have formed, composed of
millions, which not only cannot speak
English, but cannot read or write
their own native language of jargon
and interjection. Contact between
these hordes and the whites of Amer
ica resulted naturally in diverse
crossing and mixing, with all indica
tions pointing surely to the ruin of
our race and country. Contact and
crossing with the negro was bad
enough and sufficient to cause racial
alarm, but the intermingling with
the mongrel hordes threatens the
wholesale ruin of the white race in
America and the destruction of the
republic of our forefathers. In this
national emergency, with which we
were brought face to face by the se
lective draft disclosures during the
world war, it was providential that
the Ku Klux Klan should be revived,
with its rigid and uncompromising
tenets and requirements. The Klan,
sublime in principle and purpose, is
defending with all its might the
welfare of the white race and the
Constitution of the republic. It is
a counteracting product of unwise
and suicidal immigration laws.
In a few more years, without
counter activity, the mongrels would
dominate and rule America. ' In
South America, where whites, blacks
and natives lortg have been in con
tact, intermingling freely, there are
whole states in which mongrel half
breeds are in the majority, and in
which it is extremely difficult to find
a native of pure blood. These states
are weak, degenerate and backward,
easy victims to alien exploitation.
Is For White Race
The Klan represents the soul of
America, and it deserves the active
support of every white citizen.
A few days ago a white woman
and an Asiatic were married in a
Western state. Throughout the
Northern and Eastern states, misce
genation under the form of marriage
is permitted and practiced between
blacks and whites and Asiatics. This
is an awful crime against the race.
It began with the abolition of slavery
and it continues a curse of ever-grow
ing horror. In all of the Southern
states intermarriage of the white
with any other race is prohibited un
der drastic penalties. A few of the
other states, including Oregon, have
adopted similar wise legislation. The
law is good, as far as it goes, but
the imperative need is to prevent mis
cegenation and crossing in any form
and without exception, everywhere
in America. To this noble task the
Klan is dedicated. Reform already
is general in some sections. Cali
fornia is enforcing her drastic stat
ute, adopted in 1861, under which any
white person convicted of having co
habited with or married a negro,
mulatto, Asiatic or Indian, forfeits
all rights, and becomes subject to
the constitutional incapacities im
posed upon inferior races. The ob
ject of the law is the purpose of the
Klan —to preserve the white race, by
preventing fusion and amalgamation.
The lawmakers simply act like the
proprietor of a flock of pure breed
which he is anxious to keep free

from all mixture. They are right im
ejecting from legal society not only
the offspring of the cross but also
the transgressing parents of the
white race.
Will Shout Klankraft.
The mongrelizatlon of America by
the cross-breeding hordes from Eu
rope, and Asia has gone so far that
the Klan’s great constructive purpose
in behalf of the white race is op
posed actively by organized group#
which are strong enough, financially,
to either silence the press or to
prostitute it for their base defense
and uses. Every American editor,
with any love of race and country in
his heart, knows well that the Klan
in principle is right and that its pur
poses are constructive, wholesome
and patriotic. Some day they will
shout klankraft from the housetops.
Vast masses of our population, in
the congested centers, have no more
pedigree than the street dogs and
cats; they are the product of innum
erable crossings with the mongrel
hordes. This intermixture leads
straight back to the different primi
tive types. Even today we see on
all sides the horrible examples of
atavism. “Throwbacks” are common
everywhere. A single crossing ser
eral generations back may be respon
sible. “The sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children.”
Darwin quotes the case of a poul
tryman who having crossed his
fowls with Malay birds, wished after
ward to free them from this strange,
inferior blood. After spending forty
years in the attempt he still was
unsuccessful, the Malay blood always
appearing in some of his fowls. At
avism attests the physiological bond
which unites all mongrels. The re
sourcefulness and vigor of the oppo
nents of the Klan, their unity of ac
tion and purpose, prove also that
there is a psychological and ethnie
bond between the mongrel groups
which have invaded our country.
If you are a white man, with a
white man’s mind and soul, you can
not withhold approval of the Klan,
giving it at least passive support,
whatever your religion may be.
What Is It All?
—K-K-K
What is it all when all is told,
This ceaseless toiling for famo or
gold,
The fleeting joy or bitter tears?
We are only here a few short years;
Nothing our own but the silent past;
Loving or hating, nothing can last.
/Each pathway leads to the silent
fold,
Oh! What is it all when all is told,
What is it all? A grassy mound,
Where day or night there is never a
sound
Save the soft low mourn of the pass-
ing breeze,
As it lovingly rustles the silent trees.
Or thoughtful friend with whispered
prayer;
May sometimes break the stillness
there,
Then hurry away from the gloom
and cold.
Oh! What is it all when all is told?
What is rt all? just passing
through—
A cross for you and a cross for ms.
Ours seem heavy while others seem
light,
But God in the end makes all things
right;
He tempers the wind with such lov
ing care,
He knows the burdon that each saa
bear,
Then changes life’s gray into heav
enly gold.
Ah! That is all when all is told.
