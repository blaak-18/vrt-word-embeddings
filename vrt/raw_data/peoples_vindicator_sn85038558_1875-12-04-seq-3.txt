Itteullpt inl this country to estnlhlistl nol

enlee of the people; of Almeri:i to thel
clah os of high art. i e)o ll. aus a proper I
appreciationl of the Wanlt and an a;hility
to meet it were shown,, the public at
once rallied with euthlnsiasmn to its stlp
port, and thelresult was a grent artistic;
antd c1mulnercial triuniluh-.lTHE ALl)1N E.
THE ALDINE, while issued with all the
regutalrity. has none of the temnportiy or'
timely interest characteristic of ordinervy
peri dieals. It is an elegant misieillany
o(flpure, light and graceful literrature ; anfu
a collection of piictures, the rarest speci
menIls of artistic skill, in black and whrite.
Although each succeeeding numbll erll aiiordsi
ta fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and Ibeauty of the ALDIXu: will he
most app ireciateEd aiter it has heenl bound
ui.p at the close of the year. While otlher
journals inavylaim supllerior chealmlnes., l Ia
compared with rn ails of a similar class,
the ALDINE is a uiniqulle aund original con
ception-alone and unapplroached -ahso
lately withtt eonpetititin iinprice or
ciEueter. The posses.*. of a colllplehtt
volunme cannot duplicate the qlaut!t: .,F
ine p:aper 1ad engravings in au- otlher
shapeO or nitmlllr of volumes for .te llt I(ln
its 'ost ; anld then, there is the Chrlnnl I
Iesides !
National feature' of THE ALdINE i
lust be taken in O 1llnarlrow sense. T'll ue
art is EorIuopolitan. While THIE AL
DINE isa Strictly Americana iPlstitutiEnl, ,
it does niot conllin itself entirely to tlhe
reproduction of liative art. Its mlission
is to cultivate It broad and appreciuative,
art tasnt, one that will discrinminate olly I
onl grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while jilacing before the patrous of THE
ALDINE. as a leading characteritic, the
prodlluctions of the most Ilotal Anmerican -
artlists, attention wil 'always be given to
specimens from foreign mnasters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and inltrue
tion obtainable from .home or foreign
sourees.
The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original with THIE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its mnagnificent
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
thalln can ibe afforded by lany .inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
antdscape, marine, ilgure, sad animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
implossible where the scope of the work
conflnes the artist too closely to a sinlgle
style of subject. 'The literature of TIlE
ALDINE is a light and graceful IaCOIII
panimelnt, worthy of the artistic feau- i
tures, with only such technical disqtrisi- e
Lions as do not interfere with the popu
bar interest of the work. 1

The Saturday E'ening Post. 
The Oldest and BestStory Paper Pul- e
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a celitury the
Saturdiay Evening Post has been tilhe
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY b
of the Ctonntry, and has ever borne a 3
widespread and ulhlelnisihed repuiation II
for the unsurpassed lpurity, reftinement
nd 'excellence of the Serials, Sketches a
and Miscellaneouns reading matter. t
It is pro-eminently I
The Best Family Paper d
that ia published in thi uonuntry, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any firerside without
objection fromi the most fastidioni.
T'he circulationi of the Saturday Even-.
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as Its younger contemporaries,
is not, lte'tlhat of somne pf them, fluctu
ating, and too often shott-lived, but t
, SUBItE, 8OLID AND.SITBITANTIA.
bMed upon the intrinsic meritof the pa
per itelf, and not dependent on any e.- a
traneous inuencest, such as the ppulari- i
ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the 8aturday Even.
ing Post has heen in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the i
future, and with this object in view we
will elect a marked improvment in eve
ry department of the poper, and will
call to ont assistance wri ters of admitted
ability ant known nrepnrtation.
By increasing its orumer attrartions.
and adding many .ndiceious and pleas
insg novelties, by st~udying bhw to ldease
and cultivate the popular taste, by in.
creasing Industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope s nmake new
friends with eielh andt every tiass, and
continue to maintain l claeim of tihe
