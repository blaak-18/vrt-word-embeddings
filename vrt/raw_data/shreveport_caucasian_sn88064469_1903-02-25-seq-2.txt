A Terrible Weapes.
The weapon common to every part
sof Hindustan, so as to deserve the
name of the national arm, is the "ka
tar." This is a broad, two edged dag
ger, the hilt of which is formed some
thing like an H, the hand grasping the
crossbar, which is generally doublo,
while the side bars extend on each side
of the wrist
t Some katars are made with five
I blades, which unite into one, but by
. squeezing together the crossbars di
verge like the fingers of a hand when
the thrulst has been given. Other ka
tars are made in sets of two or even
three, of diminishing sizes, the blades
of the larger being hollow and forming
sheaths for the smaller. Some of the
southern Indian katars, known as
"death givers," are immense weapons,
nearly two feet long in the blade, and
the hilts are a mass of fantastic scroll
work and mythological moisters, the
cobra with expanded hood figuring
largely. There is also the "bich'hwa,"
or scorpion's sting, a doubly curved
dagger; the "khainar," a larger form
of the same, and the "peshkabs," or
hunting knife. But none of these elab
orate weapons' has about it the terri
bly "businesslike" look of the Khyber
knife (eh'hura), with its ponderous sua.
gle edged, tapering blade and plain
ivory hilt.--Chambers' Journal
