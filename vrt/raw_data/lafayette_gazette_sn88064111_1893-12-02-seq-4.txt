il KErmEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Hao discovered in one of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
lind' of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
-down to a common Pimple.
-He hbatried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit Is always experienced from
the first bottle, and a perfect cure is war
ranted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected It causes
shooting pains like needles passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
tBowels. This is caused by the ducts beIng
stopped, and always disappears in a week
after taking it.
If the stomach Is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.
Dose, one tablespoonful in water at bed
time. Read the Label. Send for Book.

in the national bonseý preaenta
dties. It is expectedthat not less than
fourteen thousatd bile will be intro
duced in the house doing the Fifty
third congwess, -
Every one of the bills that are ins- s
troduced is referred to an appropriate
committee, and if the house takes so- o
tion-upon any of them that action will
be taken upon-the reports of commit- t
tees through their chairman. If you a
have a claim of any character against
the government your representative t
will introduce a bill for yourrelief and i

Messure al
it will go to the committee on claims;
or, if the government became your
debtor during the civil war, it will be
referred to the committee on war
claims. If you think that you are en
titled to a pension and cannot procure
it through the regular channels in the
pension office, your representative will
introduce a bill granting you a pension
at a certain rate per month, and that
will go to the committee on invalid
pensions. If you have been a mail
carrier or contractor at any time and
have not received what you believe to
be your just dues from the government
your representative can introduce a bill
for your relief and that will be re
ferred to the committee on post offices
and post roads. No private bills will
ever be reported by the chairman of a
committee and action be asked of the
house, unless the representative who
introduced the bill goes before the com
mittee during-- its regular hours of
meeting, and states the facts and rea
sons for the introduction and passage
of the bill so as to induce the members
of the committee to agree to a favora
ble report upon it. After that is done
the bill must be favorably considered
by the house of representatives and that
can only be done by the vigorous ac
tion of the gentleman who introduced
the bill, backed by the chairman of the
committee to which it was referred.
There are a great many minor com
mittees of the house of representatives,
and( some of them do not meet more
than once or twice a year. It is a
singular thing, but it is a fact, that
several committees were created not
because they were necessary to the
transaction of the business of the
house, but in order to provide posi
tions for members of congress who
wanted to be chairmen of committees
in order that they might be entitled to
clerks to assist them in their work.
This was done in lieu of the appoint
ment of private secretaries. Till the
close of the Fifty-second congress all
the senators were allowed clerks or
private secretaries, but the representa
tives were not; therefore this subter
fuge of the creation of committees and
the appointments of chairmen was re
sorted to by the house.
There are four leading committees
of the house to whom are intrusted
matters of national interest. It is a
question whether the committee on ap
propriations or the committee on ways
and means is the most prominent com
mittee of the house. Any representa
tive would be glad and proud to be
chairman of either committee. While
the committee on appropriations is
probably the most powerful, the com
mittee on ways and means gives its
chairman a national reputation. For
example, everybody who has been a
diligent reader of the daily papers for
the past fifteen years has known that
John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky: William
IR. Morrison, of Illinois; Roger Q.
Mills, of Texas; William McKinley. of
Ohio; WVilliam M. Springer, of Illinois;
and William L. Wilson, of West Vir
ginia, have been chairmen of the com
mittee on ways and means. Mr. TVil
son has been a member of that com
mittee for a number of years, but was
made chairman only recently by the
. D. sAvERS, TrsxA.
[Chairman Committee on Appropristions.l
designation of the present speaker of
the house.
For many years Hon. Samuel J. Ran
dall, of Pennsylvania, was chairman of
the committee on appropriations. Mr.
Holman, of Indiana, was chairman of
that committee during the last con
gress and Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, was_
chairman of that committee during
the Fifty-first congress. The present
chairnan of that cozemittee, Mr.
SSayeris, of Texas, has been a member
p of the committe for twelve yeArs and
Sis well equipped for his work. lut

reputations as chairmen of the com

ahile Rtheo committee on ways and a

lfor the support of the government,
at tLhe other end of the house o
wing of the cpitol the committee e
on appropriations is learning to say
S"no" to hundreds of bungry and -
thirsty individuals who want appropri- m
ations for their personal welfare or ag
grandizement. The principal work of
the committee is to provide adequate
but economical appropriations for ex
penditure annually by the executive
departmeni s of the government. It in
generally conceded that the best chair
man of that committee during the
present generation was Mr. Randall, of
Pennsylvyia.
There are two other committees who
are regarded as of almost equal in
portance with those mentioned; name
ly, the committee on coinage, weights
and measures, of which Mr. Bland, of
Missouri, is chairman; and the commit
tee on banking and currency, of which
Mr. Springer, of Illinois, is chairman.
To those two committees the house of
representatives looks for the prepara
tion of bills which will prove benefi
cial to our financial institutions. The
chairman of the committee on coinage,
weights and measures believes in the
Sfree coinage of silver, and he will un
doubtedly report from that committee
to the house, and ask action upon it, a
bill providing for the free and unlim
ited coinage of the white metal. o'his
will undoubtedly precipitate a great
forensic contest in the house of repre
sentatives greater and* more exciting
than the one caused by the passage of
the Wilson bill. It is expected that
i Mr. Springer from the committee on
banking and currency will report to
the house, at an early date, a bill to
abolish the ten per cent. tax on state
banks, authorizing the national banks
to increase their issue of currency to
the full amount of the bonds which
they have deposited with the secretary
i of the treasury and for other purposes
of similar nature.
3nThere are a number of other commit
tees of greater or less importance,
among them the committee on elec
tions, to which committee is referred
every contested election case; the coinm
mittee on the judiciary, to which is re
ferred all questions of law; the com
mittee on rivers and harbors, which
prepares and reports to the house
a bill appropriating eighteen or
twenty millions of dollars for the im
provement of our waterways, inland
and coastwise. There are other com
Smittees whose names indicate the ob
ject of their formation and continu
ance. They are the committees on
merchant marine and fisheries, on agri
culture, on foreign afairs, on military
affairs, on naval affairs, on post offices
and post roads, on public lands, Indian
e afairs, on territories, on railways and
canals, on manufactures, on mines and
t mining, on public buildings and
Sprovements of the Mississippi river, on
I education and labor, on the militia, on
e patents, on pensions, on claims, on war
e claims, on private land claims. on the
s istrict of Columbia on the revision of
' the laws, on expenditures in the va
r mittee for each department), on ac
a counts, on mileage, on printing and on
r crolled bills. These are the regular
Lt standing committees of the house of
Srepresentsatives, but in addition to
them there are a numberof select com
o mittees, such as on reform in the civil
; service, on the election of president,
Svice president and representatives in
ongress, on the eleventh census, on
o- Indian depredations claims, on ventil
Sation and acoustics, on the alcoholic
liquor traffic, and a select committee
W to investigate charges of improper con
duct against a member of the house, if
such charges should even be amade cont
cerning any member.
