SUGAR
REFINERY
Will Contiaue to Runa-verything
to be Put in Thorough
Condition.
Messra. Gumbel & Co., the New
Owners, are a Progressive
and Reliable Firm.
The refinery, which was built
through the energy of Col. Gus. A.
Breaux, is being put in thorough
condition for the next season. As
the readers of The Gazette already
know the plant is owned by S. Gum
bet & Co., one of the best known
and most 'reliable business firms in
the South. Messrs. Gumble & Co.
purchased the property of the Lafa
yette Sugar Manufacturing Co. at
public sale about a month ago and
became the owners of the refinery,
w'hich, though not very large, was
built according to the best ideas
and the latest modern inventions in
the sugar-making line.
Messrs. Gumbel & Co., have en
gaged the services of Mr. A. B.
Denbo who is superintending the
work now being done at the refin
ery. Mr. Denbo enjoys the con
fidence and esteem of the people of
the community and a better man
ager could not have been found.
The capacity of the mill is 300
per day or r,8oo tons in a season
of 6o days. The Gazette is as
sured that the new owners can be
depended upon at all times to give
the cane, growers the highest market
prices for their cane, and as to the
reliability of the new firm there
need be no fear.
Aside from the money paid for
cane and for labor this refinery has
been of great benefit to this parish.
It has served as a stimulus to the
cane industry which is growing sur
prisingly fast in this section. La
fayette is destined to become, at no
distant date, one of the best sugar
parishes in the State. The lands
here are every bit as fertile as those
of the Teche and river parishes and
the cane they produce are not in
ferior to any. And when it is con
sidered that we have equally good
transportation facilities and that the
disastrous floods from the Missis
sippi do not reach us, how can it be
doubted that before many years our
beautiful parish will be dotted with
refineries, surrounded by waving
fields of cane.
Let us hope that this refinery will
prove remunerative to its owners
and that its success will serve as an
incentive to those who may be in
clined to take advantage of the un
surpassed resources which this par
ish offers to investors.

BALLAIN AGAIN
In Trouble-He is Charged With
A Serious Offense.
Gustave Ludovic Ballain, who
has gained some undesirable noto
riety upon different occasions, is
again in trouble. He was arrested
Thursday morning by Deputy
Sheriff Mouton and placed in jail.
The charge against Balliain is as
sault and battery and attempt to
kill and murder a woman named
Celestine Kadare and the affidavit
makes the additional allegation that
he tried to kill Virginia Allemand.
It appears that Ballain made the
assault which resulted in his arrest,
while at the notorious resort of
Madame Baptiste in the suburbs of
the towys.
__-Wben Ballain was arrested he af
`4Ldted to cry and became very de
monstrative.
If the affidavit against Ballain is
supported by evidence, he will very
likely serve a term in the peniten
tiary.
A MERCGIFUL JUDGE.
Scene in the Opelousas Court
The Power of Simple Elo
quence.
In the course of a conversation
an old member of the bar related to
a representative of The Gazette a
short story that is both interesting
and pathetic. The occurrence
referred to will doubtless be remem
bered by the older members of the
Opelousas bar. The lawyer, who
preferred not giving his name, re
lated it to us as follows:
"Some time after the war I was
called to Opelousas on legal busi
ness. It was a few years after the
emancipation of the slaves and the
criminal dockets of the Louisiana
courts consisted principally of ac
cusations of petty thefts committed
by the newly made colored citizens.
I was seated with the members of
the local bar, when the late George
W. Hudspeth ordered the sheriff to
open court. After the usual pre
liminaries, an old negro, who had
grown white in the service of his
master, appeared at the bar of
justice and stood leaning against a
chair. He was about to be sen
tenced for the larceny of a hog.
Judge Hudspeth asked the old
darky if he had anything to say be
fore being sentenced. Thereupon,
the aged prisoner approached the
bench, and in a manner that carried
conviction, and in a tone of voice
which had the ring of truth in every
word uttered, addressed the court
substantially as follows:
" 'Massa George, you knowed old
Jack when he was a slave. You
know I was a good nigger. You
know I neber stole what belonged
to my master and to other white
folks. Because, in those days,
Massa George, we had plenty to
eat; but when those Yankees had
done made us free, I had to work
to get something to eat for myself
and children. I went to Mr. B
and I agreed to work in his field
and he would give meat and pro
visions for my children to eat. I
worked well and hard for Mr.
B---, and I asked him for meat.
I told him my children was all hun
gry and I had nothing to give 'em.
He didn't give me anything.
So on that night, my children was
crying for something to eat and I
was standing near the door ot my
cabin, when, as bad luck would
have it, a fat pig came running by.
I picked up an ax that was lying
neat the steps and I said, -Pig, you
b'long to Mr. B3- and Mr.
B- has promised to feed me and
my children and he won't do it.'
Then I struck the pig on the head
and I gave the meat to my children
who was nearly starving. This is
the truf, Massa George.'
"Judge Hudspeth, who was con
fident that the old nigger had told
the truth, was visibly affected. As
there were many hog thieves at the
time, the judge had made up his
mind to give him a severe dose, but
he was so much moved by the sim
ple story of the old negro, that he
ordered the sheriff to take the
prisoner to jail and to bring him
into court the next morning.
"When the prisoner was returned
to court for sentence, the good and
humane judge said: 'Jack, you
have been convicted of hog steal
ing. The law must have its course.
My duty is to sentence you for the
crime of larceny. I, therefore,
sentence you to confinement in the
parish jail for the term of........
one hour I But Jack don't work
again for Mr. B-.'
"When the judge spoke the negro
shook like a leaf, and when he
heard the last part of the sentence,
he almost dropped on his knees and
cried out, 'Thank you, Massa
George.'"

A FEW DAYS
More and the Registration Office
Will be Closed.
The Democrats and those who
are not Democrats, but intend to
vote the Democratic municipal
ticket, are reminded that they only
have a few days in which to regis
ter. Unless they are registered un
der the new law they will not be
allowed to vote.
Let it be borne in mind that
every vote will count at the elec
tion on May 4. One vote may
mean a great deal to this town. It
may give us a good, intelligent and
honest city government, and it is
the duty of every citizen to get his
name inscribed on the registration
list so that he will be in a position
to help bring about this happy re
sult. While there seems to be no
reason to doubt that the Democratic
ticket will be elected, yet it would be
the height of folly to take any
chances.
Let all those who have not regis
tered do so at once. See that your
friend and your friend's friend have
done the same and all will be well.

Auction Sale of Church Pews.
To The Lafayette Gazette:
LAFAYETTE, LA., April 22, 1897
-Easter Sunday is an eventful oc
casion in Lafayette, hardly more so
on account of the religious circum
stance it commemorates than for
the annual auction sale of pews in
the Catholic church, that always
takes place immediately after high
mass on that day.
The use of the pews for a term
of one year is sold to the highest
bidders, and, as the demand for the
most desirable seats always exceeds
the supply, the bidding is spirited,
often finding expressions in out
ward manifestations of enmity that
endures from one Easter day to
another, at which time the oppor
tunity offers itself to "get even."
To intensify the interest on this oc
casion it is the custom to remove
the seats from pews that remain
unsold, to ensure that none may
enjoy the use of these without
being entitled to that privelege
by having paid the rental fee.
The entire affair naturally engen
ders much ill-feeling, which fact
causes the more thoughtful mem
bers of the church to deplore the
annual recurrence of an event that
creates and fosters dissension, and
the congregation longs for another
means of alloting church seats in
better accord with religious senti
ment. LAYMAN.

"Happy is the bride whom the sun shines
on."
One of the prettiest wdedings ever
witnessed in our little city occurred
on Tuesday, at the Methodist
church, the contracting parties be
ing Miss Louise Torian Givens and
Mr. Baxter Clegg. The sacred
edifice was exquisitely decorated
with ferns, moss, palms and a
profusion of cut flowers. A few
moments before eleven o'clock, the
appointed hour for the ceremony,
four sweetly pretty little maidens,
Misses Inez Biossat, Rena Hopkins,
Quintella Morgan and Alice Moss,
stepped gracefully from their seats
near the chancel rail and held the
satin streamers of the wedding bell.
Promptly at eleven, Mendelsohn's
March, rendered by Miss L. Mudd,
pealed forth and the wedding party
-ushers, Messrs. Frere and Givens,
leading; maid of honor, Miss Clye
Mudd, alone; bride on the arm of
her uncle, Mr. W. S. Torian, Sr.
marched up the centre aisle and
stood in front of a beautiful arch;
the groom, entering from the vestry
with his best man, Dr. F. E. Girard,
met the bride beneath the wedding
bell. The impressive ceremony of
the Episcopal church was performed
by Rev. C. C. Kramer, of New
Iberia. As this divine pronounced
the benediction over the kneeling
couple, the organist played the
soft, sweet strains of "Angels' Sere
nade" and the little girls swayed
the bell to and fro, the whole scene
presenting a most effective finale to
the ceremony.
The fair beauty of the bride was
furthermore enhanced by a most
becoming costume of handsome,
dark-blue cloths, stylishly made
and trimmed with rich cream lace,
dark-blue satin and ribbon. Her
hat was a dream of loveliness. The
maid of honor was charmingly
pretty, gowned in lilac Lansdowne,
tastily trimmed in lilac and white
silk, lilac ribbon and chiffon, with
hat and gloves to match; she car
ried a bouquet of white rose-buds,
with satin streamers. The bride's
bouquet was of tragrant violets (her
favorite flower) veiled by delicate
sprays of maiden-hair fern.
Numerous and handsome pres
ents were received, also many tele
grams of congratulation, all testify
ing to the deserved popularity of
the young couple, who left on the
noon train for a short wedding tour.
May the future be as bright and
unclouded as was their wedding
day, Is the wish of The Gazette.
Hannegan-McFaddin.
Another pretty wedding, similar
in some respects to the one of the
previous day, inasmuch as the same
arch and bell were used, was sol
emnized at the Presbyterian church
on Wednesday afternoon at 2
o'clock. The bride, Miss Mary
McFaddin, being one of Lafayette's
most popular young ladies, and the
groomn, Mr. Ambroise Hannegan, a
resident of Arkansas.
Loving hands had transformed
the church into a veritable fairy
land; palms, ferns, moss, evergreens
and spring flowers being exquisitely
combined.
At the first chord of Mendelsohn's
wedding march, excellently exe
cuted by Mrs. J. J. Davidson, the
ushers, Messrs. Hopkins and Mor
gan, parted the drapery and leading
the march, were followed by six lit
tle flower girls, wearing wreaths of
Confederate jessamines. Then on
the arm of her maid of honor, Miss
Susie Hopkins, came the winsome
bride, daintily dressed in white or
gandy exquisitely trimnYed with lace
and ribbon; a pretty hat of white
clip straw and a bouquet of white
and green blossoms completed this
charming toilette. At the altar the
bride was met by the groom who
entered from the rear of the church.
The tableaux formed in front of the
altar was one ever to be remem
bered as a thing of beauty. The
party marched out by the lively
strains of Lohengrin's march. Th-.e
maid of honor was a picture of
maiden lovliness, her costume be
ing white and green organdy, the
same colors predominating in the
trimming of her hat and the ar
rangement of the bouquet she
carried. The little flower girls,
Misses Quintella Morgan, Alice
Moss, Rena Hopkins, Lillian Van
dercruyssen, Hilda Schmulen and
Inez Biossat, were indeed little
elves in their light and airy dresses
and not sweeter or fairer were the
flowers they carried. The cere
mony was performed by Rev. H.
Wallace. Numerous presents were
received by Mr. and Mrs.
Hannegan who left for their
home in Hope, Arkansas, on
the 3:3o train.
Many friends were at the depot
to bid the bride good-bye, and if
good-wishes and rice bring good
luck, certainly this couple will
fare well in the future.

Telephone Exchange.
Mr. R. F. Hoggsett, manager of
the Teche & Vermilion Telephone
Company, was in Lafayette this
week attending to some business
connected with the local exchange.
The telephone service given by
Mr. Hoggsett's exchange, has, we
believe, been satisfactory. The
exchange has undoubtedly been of
great benefit to the people of the
town and if it is extended the pat
ronage that it deserves it will prove
of far greater advantage in the fu
ture. It must be remembered that
Mr. Hoggsett was the first to ven
ture into the telephone business in
Lafayette, and if for no other rea
son, he is entitled to our thanks.
Miss Desbrest, the manager of the
exchange, is ever prompt and ac
commodating and does everything
il her power to give to the patrons
of the line a first-class service.

Those Hondura:s Revolutions.
Daily States.
Another burlesque revolution has
broken out in Spanish Honduras, as
is shown by the account of the
capture of Puerto Cortez. The rev
olutionary army, consisting of fifty
measly half-clad sons of the sod,
under the command of some native
statesman out of a job, sneaked into
town early in the morning and
took by assault the garrison of a
dozen or more men while the latter
were eating their breakfast. Very
little if any resistance was offered
to the dashing invaders, as it is
characteristic of the native Hondu
ranean to surrender when attacked
at meal times, because he finds
more pleasure in eating than fight
ing. The quarterly and semi-an
nual revolutions in Honduras have
been a subject of much comment,
and they are invariably the result
of a lack of cash on the part of the
members of the country's aristoc
racy. When Don Rufino de Hid
algo discovers that his too frequent
participation in the fascinating
game of monte has depleted his
customary trips to and gaities of
Havana and New York, his proud
spirit becomes restless and the
flame of war begins to burn within
his breast. In a couple of days he
succeeds in enlisting under his
banner a band of shiftless and half
starved peons, and watching his
opportunity captures a town. This
done the rest is easy, and the revo
lution rapidly reaches the zenith of
its success. The next movement is
"*to raise a forced loan" from the
merchants and well-to-do inhabi
tants of the town, and this secured,
Don Rufino de Hidalgo gives each
of his twenty-five or thirty soldiers
ten cents and a bunch of bananas,
disbands his army and boarding a
vessel leaves the country to spend
the money he "*borrowed" in his
own peculiar way. This is the
manner in 'vhich the majority of
the revolutions in Honduras -begii
and end.
