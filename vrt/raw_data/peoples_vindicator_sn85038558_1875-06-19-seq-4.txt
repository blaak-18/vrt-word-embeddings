WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS TOR 175.
(Champion American Comic Paper ! .
- I
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri- e
can artists, anid contributed to by the y
most popular humorists and satirists of Ii
the day. t
Wild Oats now enters successfully up- F
on the sixth year of its existence, and ii
has become the established hlmorous and C
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a S
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of s
the public, it was changed to a fortnight- ii
Sl. Still continuing its good work of a
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up p
the political and social shams by its c
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials, c
it achieved even greater success than I
before, and was recognized as tin ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
' Lave yielded still further to the public A
e demand, and now publish Wild Oats S
a weekly! It has literally grown into its a
e present shape on its intrinsic merits, be- a
ing the first successful weekly humorous tj
it iaper ever published in this country. ti
" Among the artists especially engaged
it to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are 3
. Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins, e
It Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels, n
Stuckhardt, Day; Poland, and several c
it others who are yet known to fame. j
ý. In its literary depattmeuts Wild Oats t
wt will, as it always has, stand alone and p
unapproachable. At least one first-class ii
serial story will always be found in its I
pages, by the best humorous, satirical, r
e and character writers in the United
h States; while its sketches and squibs I
r will be sparkling, original and pointed. I
of Wild Oats will be first-class in every 1
Lt particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
it or suspicion, as no word or illustration
'- will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.
