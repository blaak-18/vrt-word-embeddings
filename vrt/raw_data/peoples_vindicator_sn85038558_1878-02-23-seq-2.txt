Some of the owners of the Judg- tnil
ments to which we referred last week f
have discovered that they have been
charged by the late tax collector, com 1
Bonullt, with a large amount of divi- they
dends which they never received. In rlpt
suit No. I77, the owner gave orders
for its cancellation which was lmoe,
and still he is charged with monies Dital
on it heo has never drawn. In suilts
frien
776, 7787 and 7751, the owner is
charged with $678 82 he never re- D
ceived.
The VINvmcATro article has de- 'a' h
veloped this at least; and it goes to O rI
show how fraud and rascality was tilhe si
rule with tile 'Prince" during his it
"ring days."
The total amount of Judgments ob- Id b
tained against this parish from 1)e- no
cmber, 1869, to June, 1874, (four A
and one half years time) was 1l4,- pe,
663.28, and the amount collected and stit
pail thereon during the same time
was $100,189 47; leaving a balance of t
due of $64,5:33.81. Of this $23,81o.
94, has never had a cent paid upon van
it, and is due for Sheriffs fees, pay vga
of officials, supporting prisoners in remu
jail, mechanics work, and witness Roi
and jurors, &c. The balance $40, .
716.88, represents the remainder due
on claims upon which an average of ona
over 71 per cent has already been Sta
paid, or 21 per cent more than the the
Lighest prier paid for the paper. It whi'
is safe to gay that the owners of this be
$40,716.88 have made at least 10 per Cu
cent on their investment. and
The people of this parish are not
able to pay any more to these parties
who have already received 71 per cent;
nor are they able to pay in full the a
amount of claims due, and it should no
not be asked or expected. $23,816.93 obi
is about the gross amount due, and prr
which the parish should be, and is An
willing to adjust. The first step in o
the settlement of this $23,816.93, tio
should be a suit for the recovery of of
the $6,932.24 paid upon .claims pro- ter
sounced fraudulent. After that, the IIe
adjustment of the remainder should
at once lie done. sti
Honest Judgments,
bra
Some of our frie-nds very strangel3 the
imagined that the article iu last do
weeks' VINDICATOR was a general go
attack on all the Judgment Creditors thl
who field claims against the patsh. an
Such was not our intention, and we sli
fail to find how the article can be so gu
constraed, . an
What we meant to convey was the O0
fact that, in the clamor being raised
about the payment of the judgments, C;
a great many of these judgments dI
were based on fraudulent claims, and at
tflinat no honest debt could or shouil
be used as a rider to force the pany- C
mnent of a dishlonest claim. h
There are.honest debts due by the ft
parish which they sholnid and will to
pay-sudl for instance as the balance el
due for constructing the Court House p
and Jail, incurred previous to the ci
war; Messrs. Parsons' atdl Burkes' ce
claims as Sheriff's, for fees of office to
andt maintaining prisoners; Keyser
& McKenna, for work done in put. -I
ting down banquette around the parish ii
property-the Court House and Jail; d
and some other claims which we can- e
not now repnembner.
But there is also a very large c
amount which had its birth in tlhe
frauds of a ring-which was issued
in utter violation of law and which
no honest Court can or wjll sustain
when probed to the bottom, that
never should and never will be paid.
We cited's number of these claims I
thlat had tailed to stand the test of a
Board of Arbitration, and notwith
standing which the owners thereof
have received large dividends thereon.
We insist that suit shlould be entered
for the recovery of this money, and
when recovered, it should be applied
to the payment of honest claime.
The *'Conservative element" has
cut a pretty figure in the legislature
for the Past forty days, consorting
with Charley Howard's Lottery hench
men and tileradieal members in order
to defeat tae will of the white men of
the State. If the "Conservative ele
ment" is any better than "Kellogg's
crowd" nobody can see it.
The "business interests" of New
Orleans invoked eggs and sich like,
in order to break up a mass meeliug

claims to be extra honorable and law
