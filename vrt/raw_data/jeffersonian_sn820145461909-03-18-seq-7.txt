I want not less than 100 men’s names,
who mean business if they approve of
the plan. The 100 men are to be the
nucleus to start, and would like to
have them from all the States. The
question is, ‘ 4 Shall there be an effec
tive organization?” Let us see how
many organizers there are, who want
to organize.

POPS NOT DEAD IN NEBRASKA.
Doniphan, Neb., Feb. 23, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I will drop you a few
lines. I guess you think all of the
Pops are dead out here, but that is a
mistake. Here is one left, and he is
not afraid to speak out in meeting.
I voted for you last fall though I
had to write your name on the ticket.
I told the people I had rather vote
for what I wanted and not get it,
than vote for what I did not want
and get it. But don’t think lam the
only one that is left here. If we had
had a ticket, there would have been
lots of them to show up. The Demo
crats killed the Pops in this State by
fusion. After the ygot them killed
what did they do ? They lay down
by the still waters and are now graz
ing in green pastures. I wish some
one would tell me the difference in
our Democratic Legislature of Ne
braska and the Republican Congress
at Washington. All either of them
are doing is making appropriations
and raising salaries. Well, I will quit
by saying I have got four of my
neighbors that what the gospel of
truth that is in the good old Weekly
Jeffersonian. I enclose a money order
for four dollars, asking you to send
the paper to the enclosed for
one year.
I was a little boy living in North
Carolina during the war and would
like your book, “Bethany,” but have
failed to find the price in the Jef
fersonian.
I have ’Voted for you every time
your name has been out and hope to
yet help elect you for President.
Yours truly,
W. A. Bowden.
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO
ASSIST IN REFORM
MOVEMENT.
Carroll, Maine.
Mr. T. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.,
Dear Sir: As I have moved back to
my old home in Carroll, I shall have
to ask you to shift the address of the
Weekly Jeffersonian from Lincoln,
Maine, to Carroll, Maine.
I have been reading your paper
since the first issue. I took the New
York Magazine from the start and
was still taking it when they forced
you out. I received it a while after
you left, but it soon stopped, and I
was glad, for I was taking it for
what you had to say.
My time will expire in June next.
You will find inclosed one dollar, with
which you can extend my subscription
for another year. I can’t seem to get
along without it. I will do anything
I can to assist you in your good work.
From a true believer in the prin
ciples that you advocate.
Yours truly,
J. F. Richardson.
REEL FOOT LAKE AND BOSTON
TEA PARTY.
Belden, Miss.
Dear Mr. Watson:
I wish to thank you for the infor
mation so kindly sent. I have just
been reading your editorial in regard
to Reel Foot Lake, and after reading
the piece carefully and your ruling on
it, I think every newspaper in the
United States ought to raise a howl
and demand the pardon of the six
men that are to be hung. I admit
that the act was unlawful. So was
the act of the young men that threw
the- tea overboard at the Boston
Harbor. Sometimes it takes unlawful
acts to effect justice.
Please find one dollar to help pay
campaign expenses.

ARKANSAS POPULISTS WANT TO
GET TO WORK.
Steprock, Ark., Feb. 14, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Friend: Having received so
many inquiries about the proposed
conference of the people’s party, I
find myself at a loss to know how to
answer. Would you be so kind as to
furnish me such information, if at
hand, as would enable me to give some
definite answer?
I like the plan of L. W. Watts, of
Center, Ala., as a means to carry on
the work. I think that of J. M. Bur
rus, Kansas City, the very best. Your
presence at the State meetings would
add much to the interest and enthusi
asm. In my opinion the only way in
which we can hope to maintain our
party, is to thoroughly reorganize.
Let’s see what reorganization has
done. In 1904 there were two votes
cast for the Populist nominee in this,
Jackson Township. In 1908, we or
ganized a Watson Club and polled 28
votes for the Populists.
If you decide to make a tour of the
States, please remember Arkansas. I
have tried to get a copy of the Jeffer
sonian in the hands of every honest
thinking man in my community and
they all express a desire to become
regular subscribers soon. The rank
and file Democrats and Republicans
of this part are thoroughly disgusted
with the two Siamese twins, Bryan
and Taft. Let the reformers enter
the field. I think the harvest is ready.
Yours in the fight to the last ditch,
L King.
ORGANIZE.
Pelham, Ga.
Dear Sir: I think one of the best
things to do is to make a thorough
organization of the People’s Party,
and have out a full State and county
ticket in 1910. There is no question
but that it would stimulate interest in
the selection of officers, and would
bring out many voters who have not
taken any interest in elections since
1896, when we were duped so shame
fully by the Democratic party.
I could name many who did not
even come to the polls on our last
election day and who were Watson
men to the core, even some right here
in town who said they had forgotten
that it was election day, and they
were all good Pops.
As I see it, a reorganization is
necessary to bring out the proper in
terfstt It Wpul4 cause good men to
Gfye
fall in line who have heretofore taken
no interest in the selection of our law
makers. They say, “It is no use; it
is going Democratic anyway, so I’ll
just stay away from the polls.” I
fully agree with you that it is neces
sary to have two white parties in the
South before the South will ever be
recognized politically.
Then let us wake up to our duty,
and organize NOW. We need not ex
pect other factions to organize for
us.- The army has got to be raised
by us, and each one has got to do his
part to carry the battle to victory.
Let recruiting officers be stationed in
every county and district in this, and
every other, State in the Union, and
let able speakers go upon the stump
and proclaim our gospel to every
creature, and in 1910 we will send a
few congressmen and senators to
Washington, and we will elect a good
ly number of representatives to our
State legislatures, and we will elect
some judges, and perhaps some other
county officers. All this will gather
strength, and in 1912 or 1916 we will
have a president and full house.
Will write again when I have more
time, but let us organize.
Very truly,
T. T. Roland.
“ASKS FOR NAMES OF THE
" FAITHFUL.’’
Little Rock, Ark., Feb. 26, 1909.
The Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga.
I note in recent issues of the Week
ly Jeffersonian that the populist spirit
in Arkansas is not wholly extinct, and
that even some are advocating a re
vival. To all who favor this I make
the request that they send their
names, and as far as they know them
the addresses of others who favor
“trying to do something,” to Col. A.
W. Files, chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee, and the “faithful” in
this city will confer with him and see
if some action cannot be taken that
will lead at least to an educational
movement.
O. S. Jones, of Prescott, Ark., sug
gests the idea of Populist Clubs with
ten cents monthly dues to provide lit
erature for educational purposes.
Make it a motion, Bro. Jones, and I
will second it with an application for
membership. Very truly,
L. H. Moore.
Villa Rica, Ga., Feb. 27, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
My dear Sir: I have just read your
papers on “The Day of Rest,” and
on “Legare,” in the March magazine.
Either is worth more than the
price of your magazine. They are
certainly extraordinary productions,
‘brimful of practical learning. Any
young person from 14 to 21 years
could get enough learning out of the
two to make an intelligent and useful
man or woman. They are just simply
superb. lam more than pleased with
you and your two Jeffersonians, and I
pray God to bless you in your noble
work toward the enlightening and
elevating of the people. As soon as I
get some money, I will send- a mite
to help pay your expenses during
your campaign for the people. A day
never passes but what I think of you
and your noble sacrifice for the people.
I yet believe that you will lead us
to victory. Kindest regards to your
family.
Your great admirer and friend,
A. H. Talley.
Why
Suffer?
If you suffer pain front
any cause, Dr. Miles ’ Anti-
Pain Pills will relieve it
—and leave no bad after
effects. That’s the impor
tant thing. Neither do
they create a habit. More
often the attacks become
less frequent, or disappear
altogether. Dr. Miles’
Anti-Pain Pills have no
other effect except to re
lieve pain and quiet nerv
ous irritation.
"We are never without Dr. Mlles’
Anti-Pain fills. My husband and
eon, aged 15 were always subject to
Bick headache until we began using
these Pills, and they have broken
them up entirely. Don’t think they
have had to use them for six months.
I recommend them to every one. A
few weeks ago I heard an old lady
friend was sick. I went to see her.
She was down with LaGrippe, and
nearly crazy with awful backache.
I gave her one of the Anti-Pain Pills
and left another for her to take in
a short time. They helped her right
away, and tfhe says she will never tee
Without them again. last winter my
husband was taken with pluerisy on
both sides, and I know he would have
died if it hadn’t been for the Pills.
In less than half an hour he wars
sweating, and went to bed and slept."
