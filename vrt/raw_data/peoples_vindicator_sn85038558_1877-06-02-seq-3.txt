Dear Sir--Your favdr of the {th inst.,
just received. My father is seventy years
old, hence this bhnsiness will rest with
mle I have no doubt that the nmunrdered
man is nty half brothef, Dr, Sidney M.
Cook. He was a mnian alboiit fite feet
eight inchies high, well maide linibs, lIght
hair inclined to curl, sometimes woro a
moustache of a brdwn colri brown eyes,
and very ntat about his dress.
The alleged bank robbery is 4ii lie,
without the shadow of a doubt, andl as
to liigainy, lie was so unforttnate as to
marry a woman with a liifing hiiaban't,
from whom she hitd to divorce, conse
quently it was not a legal mari'iagc, adu
therefore the charge of bigamy is false
also. He was no more a bigamist or
bank robber, than I am or you are. iHe
was born and raised right here fli this
parish.and town, and was well, known
by every one; giradulated in the Den
t'l College of New Orleans, with honor.
A st .tet~ent you can verify by writing
to Dr . A. Metain, M. D. D). D. 8. and
Dean of the College, or Dr. James Knapp,
or Dr. N. F. Chandler, all Dis. 6f D~itis
try, also J. Baldwin Dlnff, Mi D, Vice
President, and Superintendent La., Col.

of New Orleauns. I have his diploma
,here at home, left accidentally by him
on his back visit. I assure you he was a
gentleman of good standing, and to veri
fy the truth of niy statement, I refer you
to Wilson McKerall, .Mayor of Franklin,
La, and J. A. O'Niel, and Donelson
Chaffey Esq ; aml my fathers Attorney, A.
C. Allen Esq.
I am unfortunatey po placed that I
cannot at ptegent handle money enough
to be of any use in this affair, from the
simple fact that it is so invested that any
speedy returns from it cannot be erpect
ed. I cannot even visit your town, but
I am not by any means poor, nor am I
without friends, and I shrall ruse every ef
fort in my power to' bring such influence
to bear as shall make this whole country
too warm for the parties concerned in
this affair. The Police authorities of
New Orleans shall be (if you will kindly
furnish me a discription of G. B. Good
loe and Porter Brown,) on the watch.
I have also friends and relations in Mar
shall, Texas, and Fort VWorth, Texas,
who will a0 their bbst endeavore against
these men; also in Shreveport, who will
hnt them down; in the mean time I
call On Iour and the people of your town

to pursue, capture and convict, (in God's
name, and the name of humanity) these
men. In Marshall, Texas. I have two

Pou i' xli." ixpr'ssilg thie selltiimeltr of thli
imajorinty of our citizens on tihe political
situatllion. I fIilt highly gratillfied t hav
ilg such an able writer, a personl of such
imerited talent and inosteintaton to eilui
chitlte the sentinienis of the people of oir
p:rishli. I filt assiured that in the fuilture
"Vax I'opili" would be, to the parliiish of
Sabineiit, what Hleairsey is to the State .,f
Louisiaina. the true assertor of thie pio
ple's rights, unceasingly wielinig his
trenchant pen in blehialf of an optpressed'i
iiand persetclteti people ; bulit alas ! I find,
'''ox,' is silent and the sentimients of
the people of Sabine, are no longer pub
lickly 'expressed.
Can it be possible that R. K. Goodtlle's
epistle in thle ViSiAlrmt was too em
iliatic and truthful to be refltted or Ibe
cause his assertionls collcur with the
views of "Vtox Populi." I asQure you I
know not but am truly sorry I hat Sallline

conlstrainted to corlllunicatei on thir s oc

that "Vox" will again devote his talent
to the advancemenit Cf the ptarish, by dis
cussiing all tiliestionis concerningu its wel

Mr. Editor--I regret that your valu
able journal is not imore liberally patron
ized by the pleoiplo of Sabine. We,, in
genetrral,.manlifest a great deal of indif
fierence totward'ls reading, which is to lie
regrettel it accounllllts for thlie great want
of inftorliaation noticeable in our people.

for the discussion of all questions cou
cerning the parish ; yet there are not in

Discussiing politics in this section is (I
may say) olbsolete, the people being now
fully satisfied that thievery is at an end :
that there will he protection fir life and
prtoperty ; that the liws will be proper

lawlessness which pervaded our State
will now cease ; anid that peace, halppi

- May 21, 1877.
Dear Vindicator .
The usually unvarying rotine of life in
a rural district, like the parish of Ver
non, afflbrds hut few circumstances that
would interest thIe sensational reader.
Thie sultje't of politics iB worn thread.
hear. Madanr Rnurmor is stlruck dum ly
the sobriety, and dtlecrmi of the people,
even tIhe old ladies are striving for a
sulject for a dish of.gossip. Then air
der these distressirrg circumnstnrces, how
can air nnpretending inldividnal, like
your correslrondent, find mnitter for an
interesting letter I Not even a dtrunken
brawl, r: n-away mlatchl, or a quiet stay
at homne "get mnarried." In thie tirst place,
Ike's whiskey has taken so mich to cold
water, that it won't mnake a mean drunk.
All tne lrorses in the country are too
poor (fromnl hard work) to support a ruin
away nratch, if anybody wanted to ran,
and the young gentlemen can't go out
courting yet, because they are just cut
ting their beard, at least I suppose that
is the reasibn; to say the best I can for
themr, they are very bashful, and seecm to
te afraid of the girls, for I saw several
of them i'de tip to church recently, with
olut gaIllhitk,, and after services, ride off
as tile'y caine.
I think from tihe best informiation I
can ge that the ipland crolis of this
pirish aire pronrising, thongh from some
sections, the report is, the crops are
needing rain; in the viciuity of the Ana
coco ptalirie the.e is yet Sortle .planting
to do, and it catnnot be finished until
there Its rain. Most of the fflacklarnd
planter, have had to plow up and plant
over several tir'es, whIich baA thrown
them behind. The ciops that afe up on
the Blackland, are looking very well,
and the dry weather is suiting them.
The general health is excellent, in fact,
I think it would be difficult to find a
more healthy locality in the State than
Vernon. Onr School Board met and or
ganized on last Saturday, and it is to be
hoped that schools will soon be in opera
tion throughout the parish.
Yours truly,
We leatn thiat the Olan'ders, that
dreadful and fatal horse malady, has
broken out among the mules near
the upper river line of our parish.
Mrs. Tally Brown has lost eleven
mules and a number of horses and
mares; in fact her entire stock. Our
farmers and stock friends had better
keep a look out for this 'disease or
they may suffer seriously likewise.

they understand their bnsinuess and
their duties.
We trust that the new police jury
will see to it that no favoritism is
shown in the payment of claims due
by the parish. We understand that
the scrip issued for election expeiises
in 1876 is made receivable for licenses
tof 1877. In other words, a debt cre
ated in 1876 was nevet provided for
and is expected to be paid from the
budget of 1877 all of which is always
covered by anticipated expenses. No
wonder the parish is in debt when
such illegal !~inalgmeunt as this oc
curs.
The Commission appointed to sit dn
ling the recess of tihe General Assem
bly, consisting of Messrs. Zacharie,
Chatle, Sclhrieler, Shiakspeal, and
Berry, organized Monday, May, 22d.
This Commission is to examined into
and "'eport 111pil licenses and pmst
charges., The license system to this
State is a grlinding fraud, introdured
by Rieley, the Spanish Governor of
Louisiana when a Province, in order
to kill the industries of the then
youthfuil Colony, and throw all im
migrants and ai tizans into Mexico
and we, in our bli nc bigotry, have
clung to this wreck of despotism like
griin death, when in no other State
have they such laws to drive away
cotnlmerce and hrt!zat:s.
G. T. Beauregard, late General in
the Confederate army, and Colonel
Blatant Duncan, are in correspond.
ence on the Turco-l1oss war. Gen.
lIia'regard sends General Forrest
(by letter) h ti Middle Russia, andl
plays the very devil with the Czars'
supplites (on paper). The G(enk'al
winds up this g,'ohing "what I would
idot)," with
"But I am a man of peace, now
that Lomsiana is free. I remain
your fi iend,
"G. T. BIEAr.'T.Er A.'.
"Col. Blanton Duncan, Louisville, Ky.
The gallant General might have
consistantly added ; "I am alsi Agent
for ChIarley IIoward's Lottery swindle,
and if there are any damned fools in
Kentucky who think ther can beat
it, my dear Colonel, send 'emi down."
Tilhe first number of the Southern
Sportsman accidently found its way
into our office one day last week, and
was read with considerable interest.
It is thel only paper of thelkind puti
lished in the South, and a.s ft home
institution, should receive the en
couragement of Southeri: gentlemen.
and as it "grows in usefulness and
strengthens witl! years" it will be
come a weekly visitor, none will wish
io) be deprived of. The Sportsman is
published in New Orleans, by Messrs.
Goodwin & Babbitt, is handsomely
printed, and bids fair to "climb''
into notice by not 'f arieg to "fall."
We bespeak for the enterprise in this
section a full share of patronage,
andi wish the publ-'hers the!' full
measure of success.
'"I ha:e unsed serdral liotties of

have suffered four years and aim
grateful for relief.

II. C. Myers, District Judge of tlhe
late and not lamented Boullt ring, is
at it ,gain. This blundering thief,
alter gobbling up a large amount of
the funds previously paid the School
Board of this parish for proper dis
birsement; and for wlhich he stands
indicted with a strong likeliliood of
conviction, proceeds to take in the
Juno and Seitember apportionments
of 1876, as well as the January bal
ance of 1877. Tile school teachers,
who taught under his regeme must
suffer, as it would be utteriy inipos
sible, as well as nnlawful, to attempt
to pay Myers' old debts from tile col
lections made in future for school
purposes.
Thle schools 6'ould hIve to lie clos
ed for at.least two years to do so, and
the public is not prepared to stand
such a "pospolineiment" in order to
settlo up the dtealings of Henry
Myers.
WVe are velTry sorry fr the teachers;
who rende red honest service, but we
see no relief for them undcer tile law
and tile imperative detnmands of pub

properly remarks, out of Myers and
his securities.
