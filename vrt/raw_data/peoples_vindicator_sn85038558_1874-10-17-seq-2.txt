It must seem strane to the mass of

Rapides Fair.
The second grand Fair of our en

will 'take place on the 19th, October,.
and continue four days. Too much

Agricultural Asseociations are to the
farmer, the artist,, the mechanic, and
all skilled laborers, the medium of
suggestive improvement, and have
done more to foster, encourage and
promote their respective interest, than
any thing else.
It i44 means whereby permanent
good :will accrue, not only the en
couragement of agricultural and oth
er interest, but to a solution of po
litical dificulties, which now threaten
to overwhelm us. To the parish that
has its yearly reunions of our agrl
cunitrists, immigration is called; it
shows abroad a spirit of enterprise,
and will certainly call with it popu
lation of a superior character and its
attendant wealth. The enterprise of
Rapides deservesa't our hands imits
tion And eno6urage ent. Let our
citizens subscribe within their means
to the purebae of tickets, which will
give them;.an opportunity to draw
sown of the numerous prlses offered,
and at the same time show our ap
preciation of the labors of of our sister
parisb. Tickets for sale at T. Schu

all would be well. But'these men,
