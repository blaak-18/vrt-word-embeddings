The Seventh Day Adventists are
having a hard time of it. The
poor fellows are jailed because the)
follow the precepts of the bible and
observe Saturday as their Sabbath.
And their persecutors are invariably
members of other churches. Queer
way, some people have of practic
ing Christianity.
It is said that the friends of Sen
ator Brice are preparing to launch
a presidential boom in the interest
of this great corporation senator.
The trouble with the Democratic
party ntow is too many millionaires
are allowed to shape its destinies.
WVith an almost monotonous reg
ularity the people of this country
are informcd that a girl has been
born unto the worthy helpmate of
the chief executive of this great re
public. While extending our hum
ble congratulations we, like all good
Democrats, sincerely regret that the
third member of the presidential
household is not a boy. The presi
dent will have to answer to the
party for this serious disappoint
inent.
The New Orleans City Item is
getting to be quite a popular paper.
Some months ago it was practically
unknown in this section, but to-day
it is very much sought after by the
people. The Item has displayed
considerable enterprise and a won
derful amount of courage and back
bone in denouncing corruption in the
Crescent City. May it become a
powerful factor in securing munici
pal reform in perhaps the worst
governed city in the Union.
Yet they (the goldbugs) recognize
their weakness, and their great hope
of victory rests in their belief that
an apparent revival of prosperity
will be mistaken by the people for
a permanent andt natural revival.
They have faith in thcir ability t,
1hll. the people into a feeling of se
curity, false thought it may br
therefore, the members of the bond
syndicate are likely to forego innie
diate profit and exert their Ipower
to uairntain the gold reserve, hop

tJUat another raid on the treasury
would arouse the people, a raid
would be made at once and ano:her

The' New Iberia plan to' enforce
the Sunday, law suggested by an,
official of that town is indeed a
most novel and refreshing method
to deal with this troublesome off
-pring of Puritanism. It is p o
posed to close the front doors of
the saloon and leave the back doors
open to visitors. This plan niay
have the merit of originality, but
beyond that it does not possess a
single redeeming feature. The Ga
zette is unalterably opposed to the
Sunday law for the simple reason
that it is an encroachment upon
the rights, personal, civil and re
!igious, of the citizen. It is the
first step toward the rule of fanati
cism and intolerance. WVtile it is
claimed to be American it is op
posed to the spirit of the American
constitution. It robs the citizen of
that liberty of conscience guaran
teed to every one by that great in
strument. The Sunday law has
placed a dangerous power in the
hands of fanatics in Mississippi and
other States where the Seventh Day
Adventists are persecuted and
jailed though guilty of no crime,
unless it be that of worshiping
their God in their own way and on
the day designated by the Bible.
What it did there it will do here if
not checkmated. But as much as
we hold in abhorrence all kinds of
Sunday legislation, we believe that
the Sunday law, as it stands on our
statutes, should be enforced to the
letter. Not enforced according to
the Iberia plan by closing the front
doors only. That will be a perfect
mockery of law and will encourage
men to violate all statutory enact
ments. It will make sneaks and
hypocrites of the people and it will
cultivate a disposition among the
officers of the law to condone viola
tions of laws whenever they are con
cealed from the eyes of the public.
AIV ILVSUL T TO THIL SO UTII.
The Financial Chronicle of New
York, a newspaper read exclusively
by the wealthy classes of Gotham,
has been saying somethings lately
that are not likely to please the
Southern voters. The columns of
the Chronicle are seldom if ever ex
posed to the vulgar gaze of the
common people of the land, and
probably owing to that fact this jour
nal says anything that suits its own
fancy and meets with the approba
tion of its aristocratic Eastern read
ers. The Chronicle looks upon
the people of the South as we xknced
and unprincipled voters waiting for
an opportunity to sell out to the
highest bidder. It suggests the
lplan to raise a large fun,' in New
York to be devoted to the work of
-"furthering the Sound money cani
paign in the South." \With bold
effrontery and unparalleled impu
dence this goldbug organ coolly
proposes that a committee of the
New York Chamber of Commerce,
of which one Gustav Schwab is
chairman, proceed to raise the ne
cessary funds to pay the expenses
of the "sound money" candidates
and to educate the people with
"sound money" speeches.
The people of this section will
ha dly submit without protest to
this monstrous scheme of the New
York goldbugs, who, with all the
pursuasive power of their go d, can
not teach the pco le of this country
a tceith part of what they have al
Sreadly learned from experience dur
ing the past decades. Mloreover,
,info. mation emanating from such a
source will be received with nluch
distrust, for, like old Abe I.incoln
used to say "you can not fool all
the people all the time." Since
when do New York capitalists love
us so much that they will spend
some of their high-priced gold to
clucate us:, in order that we may
not be led astray by designing po
liticians. This beauitfil abnega
tion in our beihalf, if it be sincere,
augurs well fir an early oblitera
tion of the last vestige of sectional
rancorl, or perhaps it may be taken
as a warning to the people of the
South that if they intendiil to win this
fight they will have to do soie tall
hustling. -
T'ie (;alvcston News says that
ihc b st that can be said of "''the
addlrss of the Memphi.5 fiatists'"
is that 1by logical implication it con
tsinIlhates both practical and doc
trinal schismi from the Democratic
party withtout declaring openly and
co'urageously for that course, as didtl
the silverites of Illinois. This is a
wonderfully bright conclusion to
arrive at If the News had read
the particulars of the great conven
tion hlere, it would hardly have in
sisted that anything really opposing
Democracy, or that anything Lot
entirely for the goodi of the part'y,
_=
iCuld have ematated from a con
vention in whichr .the leaders of Dt
mocracv in the South were chief
actors. When Senators Turpie,
Jones and Harris, not to mention
hundreds of other men who have
acknowledged fealty to the princi
ples of Jefferson from boyhood up,
are caught departing from the tenets
of the old party, then the millennium
may be considered well on the way.
But perhaps the News heard of that
reported threat of Messrs. Cleve
land an-i Carlisle, that they in
tended scratching the ticket and
otherwise acting the fool if silver
should be the shiboleth.-Commer
cial Appeal.
W. II. Harvey, more familiarly known as
"Coiin," is an openly avowed Populist, and
yet we find people in Mlissisippi who call
themselves D)emocrats following his teach
ings. How can genuine Democrats hold
sach an anomalous position?-Natchez De
nmocrat.
I'Perhaps the following of "Coin" are not
genuine Democrats. They are Populists at
htart, but have the courage to go over to
the nondescript party to which they truly be
long.-Pittsburg Post.
Well, that is hitting the nail pretty squa
rely on the head.-Daily States.
If bimetallists should be called
Populists because they entertain the
same financial views as Mr. Harvey,
it would not be altogether illogical
to say that the "goldbugs" are Re
publicans because they advocate
John Sherman's financial policy.
The "silverites" of the South are
nearly all Democrats who will be
found battling for Democracy when
perhaps the fierce howlers for gold
monometallism have deserted and
joined the Republican party-the
party of "Wall street, the tool of the
goldbugs, and the enemy of the
American laborer and producer.
Three hundred coal miners have
caused great excitement at Spring
Valley, Ill., by offering to go into
voluntary slavery if guaranteed for
themselves and families comfortable
houses, plenty of fuel, food and
serviceable clothing. They repre
sent the best element among the
miners and are willing to thus serve,
without a cent of wages. They
will sign an ironclad contract.
They say that it will prove that th e
present trouble, which threatens a
strike, is not of their seeking. Dur
ing the last three years they say they
have often suffered for the necessi
ties of life, and that, rather than
see their families so sufler ar.y more
the) will becciie serfs. Thie lot of
the average Illinois coal miner, says
a correspondent of the New York
Ilerald, has never been much above
serfdom if all reports are true. If
a history of the alleged slffer 'n
endured in that StJte by the eii
ploy)ees of mining corporations Is
ever written it imay cause the organ
ization of a newt abolition party in

A very strange story is told by
\Miss Lilian WVhiting, the well
known Boston correspondent and
essayist, in the July Arena. It is a
story of pyschical communication
and has an immediate bearing upon
a contested will case now in the
courts. Miss \'hiting vouches
for the authenticity of the strange
. experiences she relates. It is a pa
per that will be widely read.
In the July Arena one of the fea
tures to attract attention is the
symposium on "The Age of Con
sent," to which several well-known
representatives of different states
contribute. Anmong those who op
pose any change in the present
