Washington, Feb 14 -Herbert W.
Cowen Fr.day night signed with mach
of the allies' representatives here a
protocol providing for the imm,ediate
raising of the Venezela blockade and
for the reference of the question of
preferential treatment of the claims 'o
the allies against Venezuela to The
Hague arbitration tribunal. The rcai
fo.malities occurred at the British em
bassy. At 11:30 o'clock Mr. Herbert
Deering, first secretary of the British
embassy announced to the Associated
Press that the British protocol had
just been signed. The Italian protocol
was signed at 11:50 and the German
protocol at 12:10 o'clock, the presence
of Baron von Sternberg at the white
house musicale delaying a final close
to the negotiations until after mid
night.
The British protocol was in English,
the Italian and German in German and
English. Mr. Bowen signed ii dupli

Des Planches for Italy and Baron Spec
von Sternberg for Germany. Immed
lately on the signing of the past pro
tocol cables were dispatched to Lon

fact.
By the provisions of these prelimi
nary protocols, which have required
more than three weeks of constant ne

tinct gains. The immediate raising ol
a blockade from which she has been
suffering for some weeks and the re
turn of all vessels, war and merchant,
which has been captured by the al

Great Britain, Germany and Italy re

pounds Sterling each, Great Britain

Venezuela Was Necessary.
Liverpool, Feb. 14.-Premiet Bal
four. in a speech at a luncheon given
by the Conservative club here, de
clared the British government had no
choice but to take action against
Venezuela. The ministers had shown
no undue haste, no greed for money
and no inhumanity. The United States
government he said had been taken
into the confidence of his majesty's
government at every stage of the pro
ceedings. The Monroe doctrine had
no enemy in this country. It would
be a great gain to civilization if the
United States would more actively
concern itself w,th arrangements to
prevent the constantly recurring dif
ficulties between the EUiropean pow
ers and the South American govern
ments by getting the latter to observe
the principles of international court
esy.
Continuing, the premier said there
was no ground for Lora Rosebery's
criticism, with respect to British re
lations with either the United States
or Germany. Some arrangement with
the latter for joint operations was the
most reasonable step possible to en
forcing their several claims.

themselves plainly and in difinite

only work harmful results, for no one

await developments and closely watch
these big combinations of capital.
Practically 80 per cent of them are

readily cured when these make them
selves fit. I am in favor of allowing
