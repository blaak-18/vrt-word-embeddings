a few who admit that they are indifferent

S Professor Laenbly, of the Cornell ex
e periment station, Ithaca, N. Y., gives
o the result of a number os experiments
t he tried with fertilizers on potatoes, the
9 seed consisting of medium sized tuber.
e cut into halves, dropped a foot and a
half apart in the row and covered five
inches deep The fertilizers were
strewed along the furrows and well
mixed with the soil before planting.
With no manure, the product was at
the rate of 13 bushels per acre: and
with Stockbridefertilizer only 135 busb
els, probably a natural variation from
no manure, and showing it of no value
on that soil. Hen manure gave 145
r bushels, Peruvian guano 158, Lister's
Ssuperphosphates 184, and ground bone
i Sis. Farmyard manure, spread along
the bottom of the turrow and the seed
Sdroppd on It, gave only 163 bushels,
but place above the tubers the result
was 907 bushels. This diference might
have been owing to several causes-as
the greater depth of the seed under the
manures, more moisture and a wider
spread of the manure.

An English farmer does not agree with
Sthose who say that one ood weeding is
worth two hoehlng. He says, never
* weed any crop ian which a hoe can be
.ot between the plants, not so much for
t the sake of destroying the weeds and
F vermin, which 'must necessarily be the
case if the hoeing be done well, as for
Sincreasing the porosity of the soil, to
allow the water and air to penetrate
freely through it. He adds: "I am well
e convinced, by long and close practice,
r that oftentimes there is more benefit de
ved by crops from keeping them well
oed than there is from the manure
I applied. Weeds or no weeds, I still
e keep stirring the soil, well knowig from
f practice the very beneficial effect it
ihas."
