' AVAsnrsoToy, March 1.—The
House resolution declaring Kellogg
(invernor calls the action of the
lb-turning Board fraudulent and
contrary to law, and recommends
the seating of the Jive ejected mem
bers.
WAsniNOTO?;; March 1.—The
Revenue bill was defeated iu the
Senate at 11:45 p. m.
Washington, 1). C., March 1.—
In the Senate tho force bill was re
ceived from the Hon se of Represen
tatives and read a lirst time by ti
tle. Messrs. Thurinan, Bayard, and
others objected to a second reading
mid it remains on the vice Presi
dent's table until to morrow. The
»ceo ml reading will throw it over
another day, and it will come up on
direct issue Wednesday, and the
Kt'Kfion closes Thursday noon.—
'I he Democrats are determined that
the bill shall not reach the Presi
dent.
1 n the House a motion to suspend
the rules and adopt the resolutions
reported by the Louisiana Commit
tee was defeated by a vote ôt $ pas
154, nays 85, not two-thirds in the
affirmative. A similar motion to
bring the resolutions to a vote di
rectly and separately was canied
bv a vote of yeas 172, nays 85, Ste
phens, of Georgia, being the only
Democrat voting aye.
The resolutions recommending
the restoration to the Louisiana
House of Representatives ot the
persons wrongfully deprived ot
their seals was then adopted with
out a division, and the resolution
t recognizing Kellogg as I lie Gover
nor until his term expired, was
adopted by s party vote.
TllK ItiVEit.—After falling slow
ly for several days, began to rise
after the heavy rains of last Tues
day, and has since risen about tour
feet. Although low for this sea
Koii of the year, is high enough for
.the largest class 6f steamboats.-
From tlie stage of tho river during
the last two months wejudge that
the extreme cold weather has dri
ven the rain belts this season fur
ther South, for the amount of rain
which has fallen here since Christ
mas if it had fallen in Northern
Texas would have given us an ex

the nc&ptanea of the W
promise by the cancus of t|ie Con
servative members of the Leghda
turo. The opponents of the com
promise 'had a largÔ meeting' on
Friday night which waa addressed
by several prominent politicians,
and a series cf^wptatloua expres

in
its
of
ted a card or memorial to the mem
bers of the crtticns who voted for
the compromise, urging thein to
maintain their position, and to this
memorial were appended the names
of perhaps every prominent mer
chant in the city. Among them
we see the names of Messrs Rich
ardson & May, J. If. Phelps Si Co.,
C. L. Walmsley & Co., John M.
Sandidgn ts Co.,
Such a* memorial, with auch memo
rialist ia one of the moat significant
documentstliat ha« appeared upon
the chess Imard of Louisiana poli
tics. It is virtually a vote by the
most influential and intelligent
class of citizens iu New Orleans, of
a want of confidence in our- politi
cal leaders. It surely makrs out a
strong prima facie case; and we
imagine will do more to convince
politicians that they are wrong
than solid argumenta One of the
most potent influences in favor of
the Wheeler compromise was a dis
patch or dispatches trom Washing
ton, from some of those u lio left
New Orleans, its most bitter oppo
nent«. . To ua there ia nothing more
sad," thàii the tone of those dis
patches» not because they urge an
acceptance, but on account of the
reason given. They virtually »fly,
these are the only, and best terms
you can get. and if you reject them,
Louisiana will be ruined ; trampled
out by the fury of the President.
It has long been evident that
Louisiaua politics have not been
manufactured in Louisiaua, but in
Washington. We have been led
to believe that tlie wrongs, and
outrages against Louisiana would
eventually overthrow the Radical
party, by producing a revulsion in
the North and West, and'that all
we were required to do, was to en
dure. But now comes v the message,
that we had better accept the terms
offered, or Louisiana will bo ruin
ed. It is virtually admitting what
ought to have been apparent long
ago to the most casual observer;
namely, that the conspiracy which
placed Mr. Kellogg in power ; the
military interference which presid
ed over the - organization of the
Louisiana Legislature; and the
Arkansas message, instead ot weak-^ijj
ning the party iu power, were but
lessons devised to accustom the
public mind, to contemplate still
bolder strides to absolute power.
Each of these at the time it occur
ed, was a shock to our ideas of lib
erty, but now each can be contem
plated without lui emotion. But
these lessons have hardly become
familiar when another aud still
bolder lessons is given in what is
termed the caucus- bill which is
boldly advanced and uu-blushiugly
advocated upon the floor of Con
gress, Nothing in Louisiana or
elsewhere; not even the Arkansas
message is so bold as this, and
these parties who were going to ac
complish so much with the Louisi
ana torpedo have uow despaired,
and tell us to endure no louger, but
accept such terms as the conqueror
may give ua

willingly submitted to be made the
crucible, in which the wrongs and
tyranny of an arbitrary and uncon
stitutional federal government have
beei: mingled aud fused and which
are to produce that wonderful po
litical reform in 1876 which is to
restore ns our liberties.
Our commerce is equally illustra
tive of the fetters in which we are
bound, and no part of our com
merce is more illustrative than that
upon the river upon which we live.
Thirty or forty years ago, Red
River to steamboat navigation was
the most dangers of rivers, aud the
Insurance Companies not only
charged a higher rate of Insurance,
but would not insiire at all, unies»
a boat was built with plank 4 or 5
inches thick on the hull and with
requisites in inoddle and
strength. The result was that
iioats for Red River were a special
ity. The canses which produced
this were good and valid, but these
causes have long since ceased to
exist. The navigation of Reil Riv
es* for 15 years 'has been as safe as
tint of the Mississippi or Ohio, but
the shadow of these causes havo re
named. The same moddles of
strength, the saine thickness of
plank were still required, the same
high insurance exacted, and of
course the same high freights fol
lowed. The result was that in a
competition of three years-; the
Carter Line front St. Louis depriv
ed New Orleans of one third of the
tride of Red River and the Rail
— ads of Text?s have now deprived
lief ot oue third more;
Our agriculture haa been tetter
ed by the same shadow of old
ideas. Our aneestors fifty years
ago planted corn and cottoït and
nothing else, and we arc doing
same iu a country, adapted to the
raising of Sheep, Horses, • Cattle
Hogs, Rice, Grapes, Barley and
every variety of fruit They plow
ed with thé turning plow and dou
ble team, to the depth of from 1J to
2 J inches, and wo in spite of steam
plow8 and gang plows and subsoil
ers and agricultural works, are still
doing the same.
Their system of farming was as
much'the result of slave labor, as
of any other cause, and although
slavery bu* passed away we are

The vocal organ of mammals, nn
i&.e that of birds, is iu the npper
part o{ the« larnyz. It consisis of
four cartilages, of which the largest
(the thyroid) produces the promi
nence in the human thront known rs
Adam's apple, and two elastic bands,
called vocal cords, just below (he
glottis or upper opening of the wind

which is effected by Ve raising or
lowering of the thyroid prominence.

Tlie vocal sounds produced by
mammals may be distinguished iwio
the ordinary voice, the cry, and th«
song. The second .13 the . sound
made by brutes. The whule, por
poise, armadillo, ant eater, porcu
pine, and giraffe ure generally silent.
The bat's voice is probably the
shrillest sound audi able to human
ears. There is little modulation in
brute utterance. The opossum purr«,
the sloth and kangaroo moan, the
hog grunts or squals, the tapir
whistles, tlie stag bellows, end the
elephant gives a hoarse, trumpet
sound from its trunk aud a deep
groan from its throat. All sheep

all the cats miau , from the domestic
animal to the lion ; all the bears
growl ; and nil the canine fum ly

gorilla« have a larger cavity or sac in
the throat for resonance enabling
them to utter a powerful voice ; and

octave of musical notes. The human
