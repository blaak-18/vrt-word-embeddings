home my wire was delighted. I was
bright and Cheerful. I had taken
morphia, not abandonly, for I was
determined to quit; but the weeks,
yes, the months passed. Finally I
gave up all thought of quitting, and
began to increase my allowance. It
was a long time before my wife sus
pected that sihe had married a mor
phine-eater, and I thought that her
heart would break when she made
the discovery. She urged me to make
another attempt to quit, and declared
that sihe would help me. How little
she knew!
About this time I made a discov
ery—my strong tendency toward ly
ing—and it was not long after this
until it was almost impossible for me
to tell the truth. 1 went home one
day and told my wife that I had
bought out my partners, and when
she asked me where I got the money,
I thus replied:
“My uncle came to this
morning and gave it to me.”
“Dear,” she said, “you must be
joking.”
“No, I’m telling the truth.” The
truth was that I had been requested
to sell and get out of the store.
By this time the drug had ceased
to have a pleasurable effect. All that
I could expect was freedom from
pain. I became more and more talk
ative, but what I said amounted to
nothing. My wife would often go
to 'bed and leave me sitting up,
talking. I would go into the bed
room and talk her to sleep, and
then feel disgusted. A hellish
idea occurred to me one night. “If
I should g-et her into the habit of
taking the drug, she would then be
companionable. I cannot live with
out companionship. But how can I
get her to take it?”
For several days I succeeded in
putting it into her coffee. I ought to
have been shot down like a dog. She
was a nervous creature, and the ef
fect of the drug was wonderful. She
found no more fault with me, and
was anxious to sit up and talk. By
this time I was out of the store, and
had nothing to do but sleep all day.
One day I did not give her any
morphine. It had become too much
trouble to slip it into her coffee. I
would make her take it of her own
accord. By noontime sihe was almost
raving. Her nerves were unstrung.
I told her what I had done, and she
cursed me, not with oaths, but with
an upbraiding that no one could ever
forget.
“Dear,” said I, attempting to calm
her, “it was love for you and a yearn
ing for your society that caused me
to give you the drug. You once said
that you would help me to quit.
There is is one way you can help me.
Take morphia for a while, and then
let us quit together. Your nerves
are unstrung. Let me quiet them.”
I measured out a dose. “Come, take
this, and in a few moments you can
look back upon this distress and
laugh at it. You know how I wor
ship you, and if you love me you will
yield to my entreaty.”
She yielded. My mental and mor
al sinking had so much affected her
that she seemed to have lost all hope.
Sometimes we would sit up all
night- and sleep all day. I was not
happy, but felt a dull sort of con
tentment. Our friends fell away and
we were deft alone. I did not attempt
to engage in any sort of business, al
though my deposits at the bank was
shrinking. Several years passed,
and we were forced to sell our house.
We resolved to remove to a less ex
pensive city, and we came to Omaha.
We rented a respectable-looking flat
and continued to live pretty much in
our old way. I knew that I should
soon be compelled to do something,
but I put off the attempt from day
to day. The time soon came when I
was compelled to go out and solicit
employment. I tried at a number of
dry goods stores, but my appearance
was against me, and I failed. It was
not long after this until I was re
duced to so urgent a necessity that I
was willing to do any sort of drudg
ery. I found miserable employment
in a brick yard. We were unable to
pay rent, and were ejected from the
flat. We took a small cottage, a
mere shanty. My health failed, and
I was compelled to give up my work
at the brick yard. We were not wor
ried over our daily bread, but over
our daily morphine. I resolved to
steal. One night I broke into a drug
store, and for weeks afterward we
lay in besotted contentment. We
managed to beg what little food we
needed, but the rent fell due. We
could not beg that. I went out in
the street one night and roamed
about looking for something to steal,
but could find nothing. The hour had
grown late, and the streets were al
most deserted, when I took refuge in
an alley and waited for some one to
come along. I held a brick in my
hand. Echoing footsteps —a man. I
sprang out and struck him. He fell,
and, bending over him, I recognized
a grocer who, the day before had giv
en me a ham. But what difference
did that make? I found a purse in
his and ran away with it.
“We are all right now,” I said,
when I reached home.
“How much have you?” my wife
asked.
“Twenty dollars.”
“How did you get it?”
“Borrowed it.”
A month passed, and our stock of
morphine was exhausted. I went out
in the street, expecting to rob a drug
store, but every place appeared to be
watched. I took my place in an al
ley, but a policeman drove me away.
It was nearly morning when I went
home. My ■wife upbraided me.
“We have just enough to last un
til tomorrow,” slhe said. “Some
thing must be done.”
The next morning I was so ill and
weak that I could not go out. We
passed an awful day. At night my
wife, almost raving, cried: “I would
give my soul for morphine.”
“Then give it,” I answered, point
ing to the street. “You are still
good looking.”
She went out, and after I had
wertchedly waited an hour, she re
turned with the drug.
The months passed. She went out
every night. I had ceased to attempt
anything, but spent my time in driv
eling idiocy. One evening When she
lingered at home longer than usual a
brute came after her. “Come ou
here now,” he said.
“In a minute,” she answered.
“Come on, now, I tell you.”
I said something, and he told me
to shut up. I saw her go away with
him, and I raved like a madman.

“This shall be stopped,” I swore. I
prayed for a return of my faculties
—I wanted to write a confession. I
had heard that cocaine had a won
derful effect, and that for a short
time it would bring back the lost
mind of a morphine eater, and then
leave him a wretch, with a dead
brain.
Early this morning I took cocaine
and I have been writing all day. I
have full command of my faculties.
Amy will not go out tonight. The
brute came to the door just now, and
I told him she had gone away. She
now lies on a pile of straw near me,
breathing heavily. I gave her poison.
Tomorrow morning all will be chang
ed. She will soon be dead. I will
watch her until her poor, soiled soul
passes away, and then my blackened
spirit shall follow her. I know not
what to expect in the world beyond,
and I do not care what may come,
for I know there can be no hell worse
than the one I have passed through.
Amy is dead. I will now swallow
the poison.
R. B. Maylliew, a former coroner of
the county, and the man who gave me
the manuscript, said: “We found
them lying dead upon a. pile of straw.
The man’s face bore evidences of hor
rible suffering, but the woman must
have died peacefully.”
GEORGE T. ANGELL.
Crowds line the streets; the horses
wear
Their black rosettes with drooping
head:
The birds fly silent through the air:
The friend of all the dumb is dead.
The man -who stood in halls of state
To plead for those who can not
speak,
Who knew that only those are great
Who bear the burdens of the weak,
Who saw the patient creatures fall,
Through heavy loads, or cruel blows,
Who -heard the sick or homeless call
Tn summer’s heat or winter’s
snows;
Who hated wrong; who knew no fear;
Who never failed where duty led,
With tireless zeal from year to year;
The friend of all the dumb is dead.
Was this a king whom we bemoan ?
One famed in war, or rich in gold?
Ah! no, far better than a throne,
He ruled a vast and helpless fold.
His kindly face is bid away;
His kindly voice no more is heard;
But through the long, eternal day,
He lives in every spoken word.
The dawn of kindness streaks the sky;
The peace he sought comes on
apace;
The children voice the gladsome cry
Os justice to the speechless race.
We honor him for glorious deeds;
He blazed the path for us to tread:
No other monument he needs;
“The friend of all the dumb” is
dead.

Animals.
