Rev. M. V. Huffer Charged
With Using Mails to
Defraud
ARRESTED IN COLORADO
Libelous Articles Published by
UurOffieial Ohio Weekly
Klau Paper
(Special te The Fiery Cress)
WHEELING, W. VA, May s—The
Ku Klux Klan is going to rectify the
mistakes of the rtev. M. V. Huffer,
Chester, former Kleagle for that or
ganization in Brooke and Hancock
counties, it became known here to
day.
Huffer, who is in jail at New Cum
berland, W. Va., is alleged to have
used the United States mails to de
fraud, obtained money under false
pretenses, forged his name to a
school certificate and is also said to
have been a party to the publication
of several malicious articles relative
to prominent persons in Brooks and
Hancock counties. The articles were
published in The Buckeye American,
an Ohio paper which claims to be a
Klan organ, but which is not recog
nised by either the national or state
organizations. Huffer was arrested
in Pueblo, Colo., recently, by an
agent for the Klan.
Proving conclusively that the Ku
Klux Klan does not protect its mem
bers in any wrong doing, and that it
always stands for the enforcement of
law without fear or favor, the great
American organization is sending a
Klan attorney from Atlanta, Georgia,
to assist in the prosecution of Huf
fer.
A special field man for the state
department of extension is already
on the ground gathering data on Huf
fer’s alleged misconduct and is try
ing to rectify as near as possible all
mistakes that the former Kleagle
made.
Huffer’s conduct and the articles
that appeared in the Ohio paper near
ly discredited the organization en
tirely in the two counties. The atti
tude assumed by the national organi
sation and its willingness to bring
Huffer to justice has created a very
warm feeling for the Klan here, and
it is not unlikely that the Ku Klux
Klan will once again become the lead
ing movement of this section.

SENATE VOTES FOR
INCOME PUBLICITY
Tax Returns Are Put on
Same Basis as Public
Documents.
Washington.—Defeating the Repub
licans of the finance committee de
cisively the senate adopted an amend
ment' to the tax bill by Senator Nor
ris of Nebraska, providing for com
plete publicity of tax returns. Tbs
Norris amendment was adopted by a
vote of 48 to 27. and In addition to this
action, an amendment by Senator Me-
Keliar of Tennessee, which makes all
claims for abatement or refund of
taxes. Including the decisions, public
records and subject to Inspection.
Amendment Is Brief.
The Norris amendment, which ap
plies to all tax returns, was adopted
by a combination of Democratic votes
and progressive Republican votes. The
action of the senate on publicity of
returns was a blow at the finance com
mittee which had reported a provision
providing that congressional commit
tees, under certain machinery must
see tax returns and make them public
If deemed advisable. The Norris
amendment Is a brief one which writes
Into the bill the provision that records
’‘shall be open to examination and In
spection as other public records under
the same rales and regulations as may
govern the examination of public doc
uments, generally."
The McKellar amendment provides
that "all claims for abatement of re
funds of taxes, including the decisions,
shall likewise be subject to Inspection
under similar rales.”
Limit on Exempt Papsr Killed.
Senator Smoot and other committee
leaders do not Intend to rest with the
decision of the senate, which was
made In committee of the whole. They
will force another test in the senate
proper, when the bill reaches that
stage In Its consideration.

forts to lower the legal working age
from 18 to 16 in the proposed consti
tutional amendment now before the
senate were denounced by Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, as being the re
sult of inspired and misleading prop
aganda. Mr. Gompers said he believed
1 resident Nicholas Murray Butler of
Columbia university had been misled
or he would not have written to Sen
ator Wadsworth, of New York, that
the “notion that every boy gnd girl
should be kept in school until 18
years” is “sheer sentimentality.”
The constitutional amendment
would not provide anything of that
kind, Mr. Gompers pointed out. The
amendment itself merely gives con
gress the right to prescribe the labor
of children up to 18 years of age and
in enabling legislation it will pre
scribe these labors in accordance
with the demands of people at the
time the legislation is passed, he
said.
