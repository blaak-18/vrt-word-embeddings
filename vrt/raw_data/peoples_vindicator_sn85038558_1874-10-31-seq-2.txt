Who Will Cut the Rope ? 7
An old sea Captain once thought
he would like to have a little more
excitement than is' to be found on a
board ship, and concluded nothing a
could afford him more pleasure than a
to go bear hunting and lasso a griz. I
zly bear. The only dread he had was i
that lie would not be able to find oneI
large enough to suit his purpose. i
However, with his man in attendance, I
and armed with a long new lasso, lie i
started for the hunt. In Wandering I
through the ivoodshe necessarily sep. I
arated himself from his attendant, I
and fortunately for him (as he thought) I
pretty soon came up to an immense I
grizzly, just the thing lie wanted; he 4
immediately prepared the lasso and i
with wonderful dexterity threw it i
over the neck of the bear-when lie
found lie had him, he put spurs to his
horse with the intention of dragging
the bear into camp. But much to his
astonishment the bead did not more,
and lie found it impossible to stir
him-when the bear however felt the
rope begin to draw tighter and tight
er around his [ncck, thought it was
about time le was looking out for
his own safety-lhe first tried to slip
the rope off-failing in this lie then
tried to bite it in two, this lie also
failed in, and looking around for the
first time apparently, discovered the
gallant Captain at the other end of
the rope. Then his rage knew no
bounds, and to get at him was his
first thought, aid he began pulling in
the lasso hand over hand as it were,
inevitably drawing the Captain to
him-who then endeavored to extri
cate himself from the coils of the
lasso and free himself from imminent
danger, and greatly to his alarm he
found it impossible, and there was
the bear quietly doing his work. The
Captain concluded that something
must be done and that quickly--ie
called out manfully for help from his
attendent who being at no great dis
tance, heard him and came to his re
lief, cutting the rope, and both fleeing
for their lives.
If appears to us that the Radical
leaders at this place have been out
on a bear hunt, and have lassoed the
bear,. but-the great difficulty is they
have none to cut the rope. They
may tell the bear as much as they
please that thy did not mean to las
so him, that they intended him no
harm-and say to him,"naow please
Mr. bear don't get mad, I did not do
it, you can't charge it on me." "Now
look here Mr. bear if you will only
stop pulling qn that rope I will make
a compromise with yoea, and tell you
all I know." "I pledge you my word
Mr. bear, I will never try to lasso you
again as long as I live." The bear is
too old to be fooled by such profes
sions, and away be pulls and thele is
no one to cut the rope. ii
"HIelp e Turn Him Laoose."
Some few years since a recently im
portedl)atchman wuandering through
the wilds of Chliifornia, came ~croas'a
SIhuge painther, and seeing no harm in
him canght the apimal by the tall apd
began to tog at hi engough to arouse
him. At sight of hfs glaring eyes
Sand ferocious looks-lis lowr, but lear
ful growl-he began to appreciate his
Sdangerous condition and called out
rmost lustily for soshe one to come
and ielp him "turale panmer loose."
Jast the condition of the parties hemr
! who worked so faithfully toget troops
come among us.
Hold on to youear panther Mr. Doss

The Radical Meeting here last
Saturday.
The meeting was called to order _
or at least what' they call order, by p
some one being called to the chair tl
and some one else appointed Secreta- e
ry. J. E. Breda was the first speak- e
er and drew from the crowd loud ap- II
plause and cheering, something like ti
a nan draws a cork from a chain- ii
pagne bottle"-by main strength and 8
awkwardness," constantly calling on fa
the negroes to scream at the heighth Y.
of their voice," so that the dead, It
though they have no ears, could hear t
them." His speech was an insult to a
the most ignorant negro on the ground. t
Col. D. Pierson was then introduced a
on the part of tihe people's party and I
in eloquent language and bold terms a
ventilated the ruinous role of the r
Radical officials in this parish and e
throughout the State. With such a
power and force of argument did he t
show them up, that even the negroes r
cheered him. The guilty parties there '
present mnstLhave writhed and wrig C
gled under the lash of hie teriible I
truths, and their feelings can better i
be imagined than discribed. Next
came E. L. Pierson, the worthy imn t
itator of his illustrious predecessor, I
Yates of Coushatta notoriety. One I
would have supposed to hear him, t
with his be d-n's and by G-d's I
that he was driving a lot of hogs to I
slaughter, or herding a drove of cat- I
tle on the- praries of Texas, in the
place of talking to intelligent human
beings.
ยบ Next followed one J. G. Lewis, i
who thinking he was at liberty to
abuse and villify our best citizens,
attacked the character and honesty
, of two of our former members of the I
, Police Jury, charging them with
3 wrongs they never committed. After
he had finished, they attacked him
a immediately and made him like the
car eating his romit, then and there
. swallow his own words and inform
. the crowd that every word le had
a uttured in relation to them was false.
About this time some difficulty
I arose in the crowd, and many provo
cations offered our people to get into
a general row with the U. S. soldiews,
but, although our trials are great,
P forbearance ruled the hour, and the
r Radical meeting ended as it began, in
t loud talking and considerable con
- fusion.

D Troops Have Come.
In July last, on the eve of another
r meeting of the Tax Payer's Assocla
r tion, H. C. Myers and Judge D. H.
B Boullt, not having the .moral courage
a to stand before an outraged people,
I left here fbr New Orleans with the
a3 p avdwesdrpose ofgetting troops, sent
s through their influence with Kellogg
- and S.'Packard, chairman of the State
('entral Executive Committee of the
Republican party of this State. The
movements of 'ihe grand army being
too slow to suit the 'purposes of tlhe
leaders here, E. L;. Pierson was sent
down to aid them vith his eloquent
and argumentative powers. And for
their ends and aims troops were start.
ed from 8hreveport-destin at i o n,
B Natchitches. At the time of their
a leaving and to arrive with them, came
t the afore meitioned Boult and Pier
son, to-witness the successful triumph
of their well laid scheme. On his kr
rival here U. 8. Deputy Marshral
Stockton, was sent for by the ex-Tax
Collector, D. H. Bonuilt, Sr., and in
his oilee and in ;ansultation with the
leadingRepubtlicna of this place, the
program iwas agreed upon whom they
'ihould arrets awhm they should in
timidate, and whom they should
i make take the woods!
*i "This 6LW 'is lSa s day-this is wy

Election Day !
Fellow-citizens of the parish of
Natchitoches, the day of election ap- R
proaches, and this is the last issue of $1
this paper before that important q
event. It has been hitherto conduct- c0
ed in a bold, manly, and fearless man- a
ner, to show you "the light and the
truth." It has been devoted to show- n
ing the many wrongs the people have ri
suffered in this parish, from corrupt 5'
and dishonest officials. It has shown I
you why you should vote to put down ri
the thieves and "ring master" in au- i
thority here. For this, its founder ti
and people's champion, is now con- tl
lined in Packard's Bastile, suffering r
martyrdom, that your shackles should 1p
be broken, and that you should feel t
once more as freemen, and cowards d
will you be and unworthy the name t
of American citizens,' if you allow p
anything to stand in the way of ve- a
ting on next Monday. 1)o not be
alarmed at the presence of armed t
men and U. S. Deputy Marshals, but n
come furnished with your registration 1
papers, and strike one more blow at
dishonesty, corruption and usurpa- I
tion, strike one more blow to free
this State from Radical misrule and
plinder. 'ee that none of your
neighbors are left behind, see that
they all have their registration pa
pers with them. If they have no
horses to ride and are unable to walk
hitch up the ox-cart and bring them,
Vote you must cost what it mnay.
DIED.
On his plantation in this parish, at
4 o'clock ; it., on Saturday, October
24th, 1874, of Acute Anemia, Capt. B.
A. TERRaTT, aged 2 years.
Capt. Terrett was one of the mont
promising young men of our State,
young, educated, the very soul of hon
or. Life was opening for him with all
of its bright and luring hopes, when
death came to his door. During his
last and fatal illness amidst his suf
ferings and the distress of his family,
nervous, weak and prostrated on his
death bed, caime the blood hounds of
Marshal Packard, to summon :him to
their bastile-his house was surround
ed and the sanctity of his deatlh chanm
ber invaded by them. Findieg him
too weak to be removed it u'as pro
posed to leave a guard over him,
which the offticer in 'command declin
ed, leaving him on his parole to re
port from time to time.
Thus lie died a virtual prisoner to
the U. S. deputy Marshal, prefering
to return his noble soul to the great
God who gave it, leaving his body to
earthly changes and the darkness of
the tomb. The parish and State have
sustained an irreparable loss in his
death, and to his. bereaved family
we tender our heartfelt sympathy.

Can any one be mistaken as to time
g meaning of the "slang"n'rords used
t by the Editor of thre above paper?
, "Go for him" means simply to attack
.with deadly and mnurderous intent,

What Says Sabine ?
Throughout this exciting campaign,
when every white man's heart was v
supposed to be beating in. unison b
with us, thoroughly enlisted in our a
cause, rumors would be whispl,d
around that "Sabine was indiffereat !" d
" Sabine was divided !" "Sabine would a
not register"; and strange to say these a
rumors always come from the same a
source and from a person particular- Ib
ly well acquainted in the parish. The e
registration is completed and the fl
largest number of voters is found on v
the poll book that have ever been s
there before. The registration re- a
veals the fact that every man in the
parish is furnished with his passport t
to the ballot box ; and that on the
day of election will be found there,
to deposit it in favor of the People's t
party. Yet, again the rumor comed,
and always front the same source: t
"Well Sabine, is now frightened at I
the coming of the the troops, and J
most of the men have taken to the
wood and will not vote." What says r
the border parish I Are they children
to be frightened with tile cry of"raw
heads and bloody-bones."
The Late Judge C. ChaPlin.
Judge Chichester Chaplin, who died
at his residence in this place, on Oct.
14th, 1874, was born in Ireland in tile
year 1800; came to New Orleans at 1
the age of 18 and went into the office
of Judge Hennan as a law student ;
came to Natchitoches in 1822 and
was appointed soon afterwards to the I
office of Parish Judge, for the Parish
of Claiborne. After this went to Tex
as at the time of the first revolution
wuider Edwards. There held tie of- i
flee of Alcalde, and on the failure of
that revolution, returned to Natchi
toches and the practice of his profes
sion.
He held for many years the office
of District Judge and so conducted
himself as to win the love an confi
dence of all those who knew him. He
died with the blessed hope of the
true christian, a reward in a bitter
world for a well spent life.
We publish below the proceedings
of a meeting of the members of the

To the Colored People
Those of you who can read will do
well to take tlA piece copied from the
Marksville Bulletin home with you,
and read it to all of your friends who
cannot read. Think over it and pon
der well the words. Many colored,
men in this parish can read as well :s
any man, and can explain to those nu
able to do so, Pause and consider
before you act, take the tickets offer
ed you by both parties', and find out
for yourselves, what it all means
what all these alterations'to the Con.
stitution of the State means-be men,
and not political slaves.
You are on the eve of an important
election. In the impending. contest
the gravest issues are involved, and
you in part, are called to solve tih
problem that occupies our soundest
minds. The white people of the
country are aiming to rescue this
State from ruin, and they look to you
to aid them in their efforts. The al
legation that we intended to defraud
you of your rights and privileges is
long since exploded. The falsehoodS
resorted to since your enfranchist
meat, to secure your undivided sup
port, have one by one, been nailed to
the wall, and to-day you stand before
the world as your own guides, know
ing and appreciating your position
before the law. In the past, laboring
under the basest deceptions, you acted
in opposition to as, but to-day things
have changedl. You now know tlw
views and. intentions of the white
people, and knowing this should yon
persist in your headstrong disposi
tion, then yours would be a grave and
sud'dal action.
The white people of the country
are your friends politically speaking,
because their interests are identical
with yours. The future is full oi
promise if you but will it, and even
tihe elevation of your race depends
upon the success and triumph of the
Conservatives. Prejudice existed a
mong you for a long time, but at last
you are perceiving your errors, and
perceiving them you should aim to
rectify them by your present good
will toward the people of the country.
Remember that the downfall of the
white people is your own misfortune.
So long as carpet-baggers remain in
s our midst just so long will dissensions
B exist between both races. Have you
not noticed the friendly and brother
r ly attitude these scamps assume to
wards you on the approach of at
e election. This is done to secure your
support, but when the election is over
they leave for large cities where they
can spend their ill gotten gains, and
where if you would happen to meet
them they would not even recognize
you. Colored men, the election is at
r hand. Choose between the native
I and the carpet-bagger; But let th;at
) choice be one of calm, judicious d,!i
beration, and not made under the
