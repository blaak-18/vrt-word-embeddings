LITTLE FEET.
O you tinty. dimpled feet.
You are fair and you are sweet
Like a sunbeam in the wheat.
If I had my way
I would take a Illy white
(Where it leans to kiss the light)
.And make sandals for you-bright
As the sun in tMay.
'Then I'd fashion a rosetta
Of the bluest violet.
In their silver buckles set
WVouldn't that be gay?
Then, you dainty little feet.
Where you walkeda 'd scatter sweet
Roses, whose glad hearts would beat.
If I had my way.
Xnowing this, dear, dainty feet.
You must haste my steps to meet
WVhen the twilight-rosy cheat
Turns the gold to gray.
Patter, patter. soft and low;
Little feet. I love you so!
I would guide you where you go.
If I had my way.

THE WIDOW'S ARRIVAL.
T WAS "steamer"
day" at Sitka and
amid all the joy
ous stir and ex
citernent that the
monthly boat
brought was one
forlorn. unhalrppy
man. Tonll Doug
las watched his friends as they eagerly
openedi their letters and listened with
assurned interest to the bits of news
they were anxious to share, for at
8itka the population throng to the
wharf when the st"amelrr's whistle is
heardland wait the conning of the ship
and the distribution of the mails. The
people crowd into the tiny post oflice
on the dock and watch impatiently for
the longed-for home letters.
litut Tomn's home letter wvas not a
cornfort to him. "'Well, she is really
elrini!g," he thlought, "a month from
to-day, if the steamer ison time. I will
be a married mail; worse luck. HIow
can I ever tell Natalia, dear little girl:
I wouldn't willingly hurt her tender
feelings for a million dollars, as hard
u;p as I anm," and ToIn whistled rue
fully.
''orn Iouglas was a naval olmcer tand
before being stationed at Sitkca he had
been on duty a winter in 1Vashington,
where hle plunged into society with
that gay abandon that only a sailor
knows. £or after three years at sea a
young fellow is quite ready for the
rush and whirl of the A:ay capital. All
liourles rcere ope-n to the handsomle
lieutenant, but there was one where
he was especially welcome. T'he
hostess was a pretty widow of sonme
twenty-six or twenty-seven years of
age. hler husband, who had died soonl
after their nnarriage, seemed not to
have laid a very strong hold on her af
fections, for after Intourning hit decor
ounly for a yearr Shio lilossolmedi into tile
gayest of the gay and her house be
came a center for tihe youngtl otlicers
who had been thie friends of her hus
band.
It was there thatt Tom spent most of
his time. lie dropped in during the
morning and discusaed the newest go;
sip or the latest inagazines and came
in for a cup of tea in the afternoon
and remained till her cozy parlor was
empty save for himriself and her.
"'Are you going to the assembly t.i
night?" he would ask.
Will you be there. Torm?" firs.
Deering had such a good-fellowship
way of using her friends' first irnaires.
"Yes, I pre.sumel so."
"\Veil, then, I ntul going." the little
-wirlow wvou~ldl reply.!
And that was the way the winter
passed, Tonm running in at all hours,
privileged to smnke or read, to talk or
listen, the most indulg-,ed of all her
callers. When his orders came for his
immediate removal to Alaska he put
the documnent in his pocket and went
as usual to the cheery homne otf 3rs.
)eering. lie told her the news, and
was really surprised and flattered by
her reception of it. She took both his
hands in hers and the tears gathered!
iii her, bright eyes.
"Oh. Torn," she said, "I hate to have
you tgo.
Now, it never occurred to Lieut.
I)Doglas befolre, Iut at this niom(rnt
the idea did come to hirl that lie was
in love with the widow. lie drew her
to him and kissed away her tears, and
before lie knew it he was engaged to
Alice Deering.
lie left soon after arranging to have
Alice join him later in the sunirner,
s i r
but, owing to the loss of a distantrela
she was, her coming had Lbeen Lreatly
delayed. It was now lmore thn l yearc
since Tom and she had part ed in Wash
infgton. In the meantime Tomu had
whiled away his leisure hIours in the
somewhat narrow circle of Sltka so
ciety, but in that narrow bound ihe
had found a fair Russian flower that
he kne'v bloomed for him. Though
Tom had not made love to Natalia-he
was too honorable for that-they had
beenl together constantly and eachn
knew instinctively what was in the
other's heart.
"I believe I'll go and tel.l atalia
all." Tom continued to muse. "righit
ow', for of course as ta gentleman tand
i flltv e I rln boundi to, ltti' iay Wrrtl
hIati j ' Wi is gl jVe to urftl'tl Alb',
hang itt I wish I had never been -bdift
She, too, poor girl, may discover t614t
my love has soreahat cooled. Ifit
ever was love it never was the same
feeling I have for dear. little Natalia,
bless her lov;ng heart."
So Tout went to Natalia and'told her
that he was engaged and that another
montll would see him nmarried.
1Her delicate face whitened, but, con
trolling herself, she: said:
"I congratulate you, Mr. Douglas."
Then, bursting into tears, she turned
away. The sight of her tears was too
much for Tomn. Embllracing her ten
doerly, he said: "I love but you. Natalia,
darling. Oh, that I had met you firsts
My fondness for Alice was but a fleet
ing thing and mny love for you will last
forever."
" Pressing warm kisses on her lips, he
held her close.
"Leave me, Tom.. It is right for you
to keep your word, but you should
have told me of your engagenment be
fore. W1e had best part now. Good
by."
"tHut can't I come to see you, Natalia,
as usual?. '
"'1hy. certainily not. MIr. l)ouglas.
It -oulld only bhe painful, for we can
never, from this time forcwarc be any
thing but the most formal of friends."
Torm was touched by the sinple dig
'nity of the young Russian girl, whose
quiet life had Ibeen slpent by the sea
shore under the shadlow of tile mnoun
tains, far from the noise of city er
town, so he bowed to her will. 'fheir
parting was a heart-breaking one to
both.
*Nattalia, I can't bear to leave you
I must have you, dearest."
"'J'hcre, go now. This is only fool
ish."
"' ell, then. let itie kiss you for the
last time. darlin t," pleaded To'm.
Natalia puitt up hier little, tear
stained face, a'nd Tomu silently kissed

A WHISPERING MINE.
Through It trirderr's Plotters Wee
Frustrated Somae Yeasn Ao.
On the western slope of the main
range of the Rocky mountains, in Stum
mnit and Grand counties, thc legend of
the "Whispering Mine," booked at the
land office as the "Mountain Chief," is
often referred to. As related by P. L.
Stockton, one of tde old-timers, thl
legend runs as follows:
Far up on the sunny side of Grassy
mountain, one of the vast chains that
forms the continental divide, there
staties a tumble-down cabin, once the
happy home of a prospector and his
little family. Overgrown by vines and
nearly hidden by spruce s.hrnbs,
one would little think of it as of
more tthan ordinary interest. Isike
its human counterparts, it may
have been the participant in many
thrilling incidents, though its present
condition gives no indication of such
scenes. It was in 1873 that \Vill Demp
sey, while prospecting in the vicinity,
located a promising-looking prospect
on G;rassy, and by doing the required
amount of assessment work developed
the mere prospect into a very preoniis
ing property. Indications were snch
that he was induced to put in the win
ter at the mine. As soon as ho had
worked his nsseqsment upon various
other propertics Dempsey returned to
the 'tountain Chief, as lie had chris
tenedt it, and built a small cabin, to
which he soon removed his faalmily. In
preparing a place for his cabin he en
countered a jutting cliff, from which
he blasted enough to allow room for
the foundation of his home upon
a bench of the mountain. A prim
itive chimney was built against
Slie wall of rock at the rear, and as soon
as the work was c inpieted l)enirpsey
brought his wife aol two children and
a few belnugings to keep hin company
daring the long winter that would
soon shut them up as between steel
bars. In preparing meals the patient
wife noticed a strong draught of air
coining from the rocks on one side of
Lie fireplace. Tl'his current of air she"
foundn usefu-I in stimulatinga slow fire,
and -when not wanted the crevice was
sh!ut up by placing a small stone in the
opining.
W'inter, with its glassy glare, soon
ruled supreme over nature's domain,
anid tdutring the dull mnouths no coin
niulicatiox, could be had with the out
sidc worl.l. lDreary, steady toil on the
part of the hnsl;iaud had broken the
grasp of nature on the hidden treas
ni-e and various pannin.gs and
simlple tests ihad short n himn that
he had encountered a rich grade
of ore in the claim. Spring. with her
hewitchintg smuiles. had again charmed
I)amne Nature and arousted her from
her sleep. 1iThe spruee and the pine
took on a brighter hue. The snow had
slowly reliilquishele its chilly grasp.
The e:linp-roltbber bird had resumned its
last suniruer's haunts, anti the magpie
uttered discordant notes from the
nei gitboringl trees. I)empsey, with full
faith in his coming good fortune, went
to tile nearest, mining cLmDtp to send
specimens of his quartz to capitalists
of Denver and to replenish his supply
of food. luriug his absencee from the
mountain the children, happy in the
springtime freedom, romped and played
upon the hillside, chased each other
tiirough and among the spruces, as
happy and contented children do. The
clday following her husband's departure
Mrs. Dlempsey was preparing a meal,
and had the stone rcenoved from the
crevice, when she wa.s surprised to
hear the children laughing- and talk
ing. Going to the door she could not
see them nor tell from what direc
tion their voices caine. (living the
subject no further thought, she took
the water pail and went for a supply
to, the sprinu-, a. few hundred yards be
low the cabin. At the spring site
found the two children, who informed
the mother that they had been there
for the past heour. She then decided
that tile crevice was in Solne wnay con
tected with the locality of the spring.
I:eyond speaking of the matter to her
husband upon his return no attention
was griven to the discovery until the
crevice tbrought notice of impending
peril to her husband.
- During the husband's presence in the
little mining camup, the news of a rich
mining strike having been made by
him leaked out and reached the ears
of seieral of that class of men who
taenl more pains to steal from others
thlln to at-cunmulate by honest work.
After a long consultation a party
df live left the camp with the inten
tion of tak ing- the cla im from Dempsey
by force. Arriving on the slope of
Girassly momintain, they carefully made
their way to the spring. fThe hour was
almost noon, and they waited for
)Demtnpscy to leave the claim and to go
to hlis cabin for dinner, when they pro
posed to qliietly enter the tunnel anld
by a show of force keep the owner fromn
assertintg his rights. Seated about the
stnring they stoke in low ton~s of their
plans and the triclk they were about to
play upon the unsuispecting prospector.

THE MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE.
And It Never Wouldl Have Happened If
Arabella Iad Arrived Sooner.
She was visiting her married sister,
and young Mr. lIuucome was extreme
ly anxious to win the golden opinion
of this sister and so obtain a clean par
lor for his dburtship. It was this de
sire which lured* him beyond his con
versational depths and proved the ship
wreck of his hopes.
"I suppose you are fond. of babies,
Mr. ]iuncome?" observed his hostess,
who was entertaining 1.Irn while her
sister was up-stairs putting on her
hat.
"Oh, that is extremely us. They
they are so-so innocent-you know."
"Indeed they are, MIr. Iuncome.
You are a real child lover, I can see.
I want you to see Ivry baby before you
go. I am expecting it home at any
moment now. You see, I wis going to
a reception last night, and the dear
little thing's godmother volunteered(to
keep it for me."
"'Ah-ah, delighted, I'm sure," mur
mured the terrified young man. "Aw
-that is, they-they seem almost like
beings from another world: I-I
scarcely dare to touch one of them."
"Dear baby will go to you at once, I
ami sure, Mir. liuncome. I never saw a
baby Iess-afraid of strangers, and so
willing to kiss them, too."
Drops of perspiration stood out on
MIr. liuncome's brow. "I have a slight
cold to-day, and I once read that one
should never kiss a child under such
curcuxnstances. I have never done
such a thing since then, .1 assure you."
"Ah, you are indeed A rare child
lover, MRr. Huncomne. My baby is so
good, too. and scarcely ever cries-in
the daytime, that is."
"Very nice indeed, I'm sure. Bables
are so-so different about that, you
know. WVhy, a little friend in the next
room at the ihotel kept me awake
twelve hours lalst night."
"l'crhanps the poor little teing was
ill, MIr. IUnucome. Now. m; baby is
not at all like others. Vhal. do you
think of a laby that is so sensible it
will not really cry loudly for. fear of
di:,sturbing others? Yet that is just
what min baby does, though I can
never get my husband to ackuowledge
it."
"Ah-perhaps lie does not really alr
preciate the little angel. Now, if he
had only heard that little howler last
night hlie woul do so."
"I shall-tell him you said so. What
is you hotel, Mh'. lDuncome?"
"The Skyscraper, and I only hope 1
shall not be obliged to move, as I told
the clerk, to get away from that
leather-lun ged infant."
"The Skyscraper! Why, that was
wher'e my baby was last night. Did you
see it'?"
"I-I think not. I am afraid that
Miss Arabella and I will be late for the
mil titnee."
"Oh, no, there is no hurry; Arabella
never cares for the first act, anyhow.
\Vhy, here comes I he nurse with baby
now-you shall see the little darling.
Well, Nora, how did baby get along
without me last night?"
"Oh, very well indeed, mum; ii
dil 'tL be crying as much as usual. But
somie unisty brute iii the next room
kept pounding on the vwall and calling
to uis to strangle the blessed angel if
we couldn't quiet it any other way.
The clerk said he threatened to leave
this mnorning if the baby didn't."
MIr. huncome turned ashy pale and
wondered if Arahella would arrive in
season to save his life.
"I am sure, Mr. Bluncombe," ob
served his hostess, and there was a
blizzard in her voice, "I am sure I
hojpe that mIy baby did not disturb
you last night."
"Oh. no, I amn sure not. Such-such
a manly little fellow as lie is:"
"Mlanly indeed, John Henry Bun
cone., I'd have you to know that pmy
baby is a girl, and she has more sense
this blessed minute than yeu will ever
have!"
And when Arabella at last came
down she found him alone with his
melancholy thoughts.-Chicago.Times
Herald.
A IHeart l'.rty.
iThe old-time donkey party recently
suggested a newv form of evening en
teIrtinmeunt, namely, a "heart party."
A large heart nmade of red flannel cloth
was pinned upon a sheet hung from a

sewed a small circle of white. Arrows
of whlite cloth with pins placed there
in wel-re given to the guests, each ar
row bearing a number, the number
