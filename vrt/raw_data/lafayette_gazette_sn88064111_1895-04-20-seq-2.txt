: `ANTD BY THE NOAIVNEES.
That the ticket norhinated by the
mss imeeting last Thursday right is
-n.*ood one no "fair and unpreju
iided voter wil. deny. There may
be some genaiemen on it that some
,Demockits may not like, but such
'result itle inevitable in the forma
'tioin o a ticket. The wisest men
'on earth could not select a ticket
*.thkt would suit everybody, therefore
all objections arising from personal
dislikes should be overcome in a
spirit of fairness.
All who claim allegiance to the
Democratic party should bear in
mind that the ticket was nominated
by the Democratic party of the
town of Lafayette, and for that rea
son, if for none other, every Demo
crat should support it.
Men who participate in a num
inating convention are honor
bound to vote for the persons
chosen by that convention. This
is an established principle of all
political parties. It has been re
cognized by the leaders of the De
mocratic party since its incipiency.
None but a turncoat or unprinci
pled person will vote against men
chosen by a mass meeting or con
vention in which he participated.
The Gazette again expresses the
belief that the ticket selected is a
good one, composed of business
men, possessing, in a eminent de
gree, the necessary qualifications to
utfufi the duties of the offices for
which they have been nominated.
No town can prosper without the
benificent influences of a wise and
intelligent administration of its
municipal affairs.
'From an economic and judicious
exqenditure of public moneys much
good always accrue. Look at the
towns which are forging ahead and
you will see that one of the
main causes of their prosperity lies
in the fact that competent heads
run their municipal governments.
The election of good men to the
offices of Mayor and councilmen
is of the greatest importance to the
people of the town and nothing
should be left undone to accomp
lish that end.
SO UND £MONEY.
President Cleveland's letter to
the business men of Chicago a few
days ago was simply a rehash of his
monometallic ideas. He" advo
cates a gold standard as the only
safe financial policy, unless silver
shall be adoptedi by an international
agreement. It is safe to say that that
will not happen within the next
hundred years, the more especially
since England being the largest
creditor comuntry in the world, will
never agree to it. Meanwhile in
the United States, the most re
sourceful country on earth, gold
will continue to appreciate and
consequently debts increase" to an
alarming degree. Within ten years
debts have increased too per cent;
that is, it requires twice as much
products to pay $xoo to-day as it
seaired to pay $zoo ten years ago,
snd the teldency is downward all
the time. If sound money can
thus bankrupt the people, it is
about time that we try cheap money
and get even so as to start fresh,
tlse our government will find itself
compelled to repeat history and
enact a law wiping out debts in toto
in order to relieve the oppressed
and groaning people.
Z'TE SITUA ZION.
Every now and then some one
comes forward with an infallible
remedy for the hard times. One
asserts that silver is the Panacea,
another that it is overproduction,
saethe that it is class legislation,
•tc. etc., and the great majority
settle the affair very satisfactorily
.f saying that nobody knows what
is the matter, and there isn't a man
Xving able enough to find out.
T.he fact of the matter is, there is a
*4reae deal wrong and correcting
one thing will not set matters right.
U:ndoubtedly selfishncss is at the
bottom of it all, and this- hydra
a monster has so entwined
9n -our civilization, that it
that -no less than a complete
of . existing ' institutions

is. not of sud
it has been growing
1d is just flowering into
since the people have
_ ,  . .. .
realized it, anid are thoroughly veu
tilatitdg tie itiatter, it is spore than
likely thata change will bewrought;
let us" ole for the better; but when
great changes are made it is always
to be feared that overzeal or incort
siderate haste will for the moment
defeat the purpose.
The Guardian-Journal says that
prohibition in Clairborne parish
does not prohibit, as whisky can. be
bought in Homier in any quantity.
The Sugar Belt Vindicator is a
lttle gay over the prospects of
Republican success. It says that
party will be ruling the country
even when the next generation will
be in its grave. While The Ga
zette will not speak for the unborn,
it will venture to assert that the
editor of the Vindicator is talking
through his hat.
Populist Manning writes to the
Franklin "Vindicator "that if the
Democratic party in Louisiana
should make this (ballot reform)
the main issue" he would be glad
to come down and help it. The
best way for Manning to do effec
tive work for the Louisiana Democ
racy, would be by working against
it.
Is it not passing strange that the
way the income tax now stands the
very people it was intended to
reach are exempt from its ex
actions. It is a pretty hard matter
to reach the coffers of the wealthy
in a constitutional manner, though
the trusts and other monopolies
continue to squeeze the very life
out of the masses and they manage
to keep within the law.
The Opelousas Call is waging re
lentless war against the dagoes or
Syrians. Editor Breaux is a little
too severe on these poor people.
If they commit crimes, punish
them, but why not treat them as
human beings as long as they be
have.

The New Sectionalism.
Milwaukee Journal.
Of late there have been several
developments of sectionalism in
this country along lines new in our
history. Just now, the most prom
inent is the monetary question. It
is the South and West against the
North and East. The geograph
ical line is not definite as was the
slavery line, but zig-zags across the
country from the Southeast to the
Northwest. This separation is due
to business conditions and not sen
timent. It is easy to say that the
free silver men and Populists must
give up their vagaries, and it must
be expected that they will, or at
least, that they will modify their
views. But the situation demands
conservative thought. Opinion and
Interest are apt to go together. In
terests must be made harmonious
and national; then sectionalism will
disappear. Another indication of
sectional tendency in thought and
motive crops out in the disposition
of various States and sections to
seek trade protection for themselves
at the cost of the neighbors. Illi
nois has had before its Legislature
a proposition to tax beer from
other States. Minnesota and other
States have legislated so as to ex
clude, to some extent, Chicago
beef. The West, represented by
California, is using every means to
restrain Eastern trade from compe
tition with her own while seeking a
wide market for her products. One
section of the country wants high
tariff on one class of goods, another
wants the rate low. All this begets
rivalry and antagonism of sections.
Our country is wide; its interests
are as diverse as its parts. In the
attempt to legislate restrictively for
the whole, some part is injuriously
affected. We must take broader
views now than were necessary
when all our interests were east of
the Mississippi. More freedom
must be allowed under any generat
policy.

Then and Now.
Phere was a time when he who would
kc4p informed of the progress of knowledge,
the record of discovery actd invention, and
the currents of liuman thought, - could andd
indeed must rely chiefly 12 not wholly upon
books. That day hias passed. Books we
must still read, as the crystallisation and
permanent embodiment of human thought
and knowledge. But to-day it is the news
paper, the magazine, the periodical review,
upon which we must chiefly depend if we
would follow closely the intellectual move
ment of the day. And now a new difficulty
has arisen. This newspaper and periodical
literature has become so multitudinous and
bulky as to be a heavy burden to the busy
man or woman, while even the person who
has leisure and inclinatlon to read widely
is often unable to get access to the current
publications. Especially is the smaller
cities, villages, and rural districts is the
lack of such opportunity felt. It is felt by
the clergyman, the teacher, the lawyer, the
physician, the merchant, the artisan, the
farmer and the cultured and thoughtful
practical literary question is: With all
these and many other classes of persons the
great practical literary question is: How
can. I best supplement my indispensible
home paper? It was to answer this ques
and meet this demand that PUBLIC OPIN
ION (now published in New York City)
was founded'nine years'ago. It selects the
best, condenses it to the lust degree, and
serves it in convenient and attractive form.

CONDUCTED DY TIIE LAFAVETTE W.,C. T. U.
Freedom or Slavery.
A man said: "I won't sign the pledge be
cause I won't sign away my liberty."
"What liberty?" "Liberty to do as I
please." Is that liberty? Any man that
does as he pleases, independent of physical,
moral and divine law, is a mean, miserable
slave. There is not so pitiful a slave that
crawls the face of this earth as the man that
is the slave of evil habits and evil passions.
What is it to be free? To be capable of
self-government is to be free. To abandon
every habit that vou consider to be wrong,
is to be free. To fight against that which
holds you in bondange, is to be free. A
man that overcomes an evil habit as a hero.
I knew a man who said he would give up
the use of tobacco. He took his plug of to
bacco out of his pocket and threw at away,
and said: "That is the end of the job."
But it was only the beginning. He found
the very tip of his tongue clamored for it.
He said: "I will go and get another. I
will buy another plug, and when I want it
awfully, then I will take a little." And he
did want it awfully, and took his knife and
his piece of tobacco, and then he thought it
was God's spirit striving with him. He
held the tobacco in his hand and said: "I
love you and I want you. Are you my mas
ter, or am I yours? That is a question I am
going to settle. You are a weed, and I am
a man. You are a thing, and I am a man.
I will master you if I die for it. It never
shall be said of me again: 'There is a man
mastered by a thing.' I want you, but I
will just take care of you. I will fight you
right through." He said it was six months
before he could get over the desire for that
tobocco; but he fought i* right through.
That man was a hero. A hero has to bat
tle against an enemy. Cocks can fight and
dogs can fight; but for a man to battle
against himselt, to conquer every evil desire
and wicked passion in the sacred name of
duty, that is to be brave.--John B. Gough.
No statistics are needed to assure you thal
temperance reform lies at the bottom of alt
futher political, social and religious pro
gross. Drink is the curse of the country.
It ruins the fortunes, it injures the health,
it destroys the lives of one in twenty of our
population, and anything which can be done
to diminish this terrible sacrifice of human
life and human happiness if well worthy of
all the attention and study we can give it......
The agitation will go on without us if not
with us. If we are silent, the very stones
would cry out. If there is in the whole of
this drink business any single encoiraging
feature, it is to be found in the growing im
patience of the people at the burden which
they are forced to bear, and their growing
indignation and sense of the shame and dis
grace it imposes upon themn.-Joseph Cham
berlain, M.P. President of the London
Board of Trade and Chairman of National
Educational League of England.
