GOOD ADVICE TO THE COTTON
GROWER.
Lor Angeles, Cal., Dec. 14, 1908.
I Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Editor and
i Proprietor of “The Jeffersonians.”
I Thomson, Ga.
[ Dear Sir: I read with pleasure
( your address at the Farmers’ Union
Convention in New Orleans. I have
C,. been a member of organized labor
/for over thirty years, a student of
J labor and economic questions. I
A want to suggest the way out for the
¥1 Farmers’ Union and the cotton grow
|| ers of the South. A remedy, a solu
|j tion, as I view it, from the Pacific
i coast. That is co-operation. The
cotton growers ought, with their
■ strong and powerful unions, to form
■corporations of their own, build their
•own manufactories, own and operate
JI them in their own interest, employ
■ their own people, and those who
R need employment after the crops are
I matured and sold to their own sac-
J tories; instead of selling their cotton
■ in Northern and Eastern States and
■ Europe for less than it is worth, and
| paying them an enormous profit,
fwith the railroad freights, etc., add
s• 'd, back for the goods that has been
cAianufactured out of the very cotton
I they sold at a reduced price. Why
Knot manufacture their own cotton at
gnome, and buy the goods at home?
Jnve the nine hundred millions made
I <?y foreign manufacturers, and many
■nillions made by the Eastern and
■Northern capitalists and speculators.
■ They could ship and sell the goods in
■stead of selling the raw cotton. Then
■bvote for no man nor no party who
not favor the public ownership
■end operation of all public utilities
■hat require franchises. This gov
■ernment ought to own the telegraphs,
■railroads, ships, etc. Congressman
■Hobson is all the time wanting more
■war ships that would carry a large
| number of men in idleness over the
with millions invested in the
■ips and equipment. This Govern
,J Rd ought to build a large number
largest and best merchant
11 \ that could be converted and
ai Aimed into war ships immediately in
of war; enough ships could
V built to carry on all the trade of
Jiis nation to and from all countries
X the world. If these things- were
y then the farmers could live
’’■> money, and educate their
■ 7 w ought to be. Then,
1 pq.ships afloat on every
. ftsrwould dare to tackle
■ If other people can make so much
■nwuey buying the raw cotton and
it into goods to sell back to
■the fanners and others, why can’t
■ they manufacture their cotton and
■ make money, too? The people of the
are large consumers of cotton
Jr goods; ought to make them and buy
■them at home.
Believing this to be the keynote
the solution for the cotton grow
■ \ I hope you will agree with me
fTt? my suggestions room in The
, V Xins, if you can, and oblige
\ m^ ac^er an d Populist.

LOOKING BACKWARD.
God’s hand has planted another
year
In the fruitful soil of Time —
To the tragic poem of human life,
Is added another rhyme,
And I sit here in a stranger town,
Widowed of all the joy
I used to know at the glad New Year,
When I was a little boy.
’Twas only a few brief years ago,
Telling the days that are dead,
But it seems to me like a century —
Counting the hopes that have fled—
Since my heart, like the gold of Par
vaim,
Was free from all alloy—
Oh! brighter than heaven seems now,
was earth,
When I was a little boy.
I’ve wandered, restless as the wind,
Through many a foreign land
And plucked the pleasure-buds of
earth,
From Clyde to Samareand,
But found no flowers pure from
blight,
No secret that did not cloy—
Oh! never a canker cursed a bud,
When I was a little boy.
*
I’ve found the wisdom that’s born of
pain,
The sorrow that comes with years,
And paid the price that Adam paid
For knowledge—and for tears.
But I’ve lost my faith in friendship’s
vow
And love’s a broken toy—
I used to believe in mother and God —
When I was a little boy.
Oh! sadder than death is the bitter
change
Tn the trusting heart of youth—
Better believe in a wholesome lie
Than forever doubt the truth.
What care I now for Arthur’s fame
Or the ten years’ siege of Troy?
The heroes are myths, that I used to
love—
When I was a little boy.
’Tis true that memories are mine,
Unutterably bright,
But, like the stars, they shine above
And only show ’tis night—
And the darkness is thick with tempt
ing fiends,
Luring to destroy— *
I used to live in the light of God,
When I was a little boy.
It may be true —and I hope it is—
That death will end this pain—
That, on the shores of another world,
I’ll be a child again
And feel, with fullest faith and love,
The olden golden joy
That came of my trust in mother and
God,
When I was a little boy.
—Henry Lynden Flash.
THE CHIEF MOURNER.
The minister had just been giving
the class a lesson on the prodigal
son. At the finish, to test what at
tention had been paid on the
teaching, he asked, “Who was sorry
that the prodigal had returned?”
The most forward youngster in the
class breathlessly answered, “The
fatted calf!”—Home Herald - .

Invest Your Savings
If you have Ten Dollars,
Don’t let it lie idle.
Invest it in a Jeffersonian Bond,
Where it will draw Seven per cent.
Put some money aside for the kids,
Or a little for a rainy day.
These bonds are absolutely safe,
And they pay a high rate of interest.
There is no better investment
In the country to-day
Than a Jeffersonian Bond.
