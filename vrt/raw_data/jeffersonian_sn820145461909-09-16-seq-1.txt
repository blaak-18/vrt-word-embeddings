THE STRANGE CASE OF ELLA
GINGLES.
The other day a Chicago jury dis
posed of the strangest criminal case
on record.
Early in January Miss Agnes Bar
rette, who keeps a lace store at the
Wellington Hotel, had Ella Gingles,
a seventeen-year-old girl, arrested,
charged with stealing some Irish
lace. Miss Gingles, who is an ex
pert lace maker, left Ireland less
than two years ago, and at the time
of her arrest had been in Chicago
only a few weeks.
She had no influential friend, but
denied the charge and threw herself
on the mercy of Captain O’Brien,
who induced Patrick H. ~ O-Donnell
and John P. O’Shaughnessy, two' of
Chicago’s leading lawyers, to under
take her defense. ' They' interested a
number of club women in the' case
and went quietly about the work of
preparing for a speedy'trial.
The girl, having been' released
on bail, had dropped from public
notice, wh§n suddenly one morning
Chicago awoke and found the world
gazing at" her In horror.
Ella Gingles had been found in a
room in the Wellington, bound hand
and foot and slashed about the knees
ahd thighs in twenty-three places,
weltering in blood. She was remov
ed to a hospital raving like a mani
ac,' begging to be saved from “that
nian,” and declaring that site 'would
not go to “French Lick to be a white
slave.’’ In her delirium she 're
peatedly mentioned the -names of
Agnes -Barrette-and Cecelia Kenyon.
■When Miss* Gingles recovered her
senses she told the most revolting
tale ever -framed by human tongue.
Language never portrayed deeper
depths of depravity and degradation
than set forth in her story. For the
first - tirpe -many pure-minded club
women heard how lustful demons in
human form*
- "■ « .
“Delve dowji in degradation to pro
long ..
A saturnalia of rottenness.’’
Things so- utterly vile could not
appear in Devils damned
would blush to own- such deeds. The
shocking’ narrative spread ~~f ro m
mouth to ear- until all had heard.
Each day, when the trial started,
there was ’A perfect' jain of people'
crazy to- hear the sickening details.
The oldest lawyers’ never before'wit
nessed such': exhibitions of morbid
curiosity:
Miss Gingles repeated her charges
to the jlify and brought tears to
their eyes.' Strong men wept. Wom
en'sat petrified with horror. If she
told the truth the Devil will bar the
gates of hell against Agnes Barrette,

ANNOUNCEMENT OF MEETING
I - ------- -
There will be a public meeting on next Satur
day morning, the 18th inst., at ten o’clock, at
Lagrange, Troup County, Georgia, to organize a
JEFFERSONIAN CLUB.
- All white persons are invited, regardless of
age, sex or creed.
A great movement is in progress. All citizens
who can get to this meeting should be on hand.
gentleman might be hid in the judi
cial wood-pile, and gave added
weight to the girl’s story. The
whole matter is still enshrouded in
an impenetrable cloud of mystery.
There was some “tall swearing”
on both sides. .The jury became so
befuddled in trying to reach a ver
diet that it. couldn't tell which of
the two women was on trial, and
pronounced them both innocent.
Here' is the verdict as rendered:
“Wo, the jury ’find the defendant,
Ella Gingles, not guilty. We, the
jury, further find that the charges
against Agnes Barrette are unfound
ed and untrue.”
It.cost SIO,OOO to convince twelve
men that neither side had a chance,
and tha-t all the witnesses were liars.
The idea of finding Agnes Barrette
not guilty, when she was not on trial
makes the verdict unique. It ought
to be placed in the archives- with
the verdict of a jury in a justice
shop which came -to my notice. some
years ago. They could not agree,
and brought in a verdict as follows:
“We, the jury, agree to disagree
on account of a lack of evidence on
bdtlr sides.” . .
In the printable part of her story
Ella Gingles said that the Barrette
woman tried to sell her into‘white
slavery-’and that Tom Taggart was
to be her first owner. In-his testi
mony Taggart swore' that he had
never heard of the girl, and was even
ignorant of the meaning of the term,
“white slavery”.
Nevertheless, “white slavery” does
exist in Chicago, and in every large
city in the country. As a commercial
proposition it is the acme of infamy,
and in many instances has the pro
tection of corrupt politicians and
their henchmen in control of city af
fairs.—Brann’s Iconoclast. -- •
PRICES OF NECESSITIES GOING
HIGHER.
The latest figures published, by
Bradstreet’s show that the. prices of
necessities are rising steadily month
by month. On August 1 they were
higher than-they were on July 1, and
they were higher on July . 1 than
they were on June 1. “Everyone,”
says Bradstreet’s, “knows that com
modities are high and that as a re
sult household budgets in homes of
limited incomes feel the burden of
this upward tendency. In fact, in
some quarters, economies have to
be rigidly practiced in order to make
both ends meet, as it were.”
Between the great production of
gold and an upward revision of the
tariff it is plain that a higher cost
of living has come to stay, and how
far the trend is to be carried is daily
becoming a deeply interesting ques
tion to many deserving people. Be
yond all doubt the new tariff will
promote higher prices and the stand
patters will indeed have a difficult
task when they attempt to justify
their work before oppressed and
overburdened consumers. And the
more prosperous the times are, the
higher the prices of necessaries will
be apt to go. The man who sees his
bills going up month after month
will not take kindly to a party that
taxes him without bringing relief in
any direction. Age-

YOU DON’T HAVE TO DROWN.
■'Ninety-nine times in one hundred
drowning is the result of fright and
frenzy. There is a public horror of
cramps. Not" one case of cramps in
one thousand is dangerous if the vic
tim knows what to do and does it.
Every long-distance swimmer enter
ing a race expects to get cramps, yet
ho doesn’t drown and he doesn't stop
swimming, either. He keeps going
until his legs are in knots; still, he
doesn't sink. He plugs along until
there isn't another kick in him, and
even now he doesn’t go down. In
stead of that he rolls over on his
back-and-waits for the boat to pick
him up. It may be a minute or it
may be an hour, but until the boat
comes the expert will be -floating
around like a ship.
When you catch a cramp in your
arms or legs don't get excited. You
may yell, but keep yourself under
control. Don’t exert yourself, for it
takes little or no effort to keep afloat.
Crush down the feeling of panic.
Stretch out your arm or leg, aS the
case may be; until you are' straining
to the utmost. Then’ strain a bit
harder,’ and watch the lumped mus
cle go down.
The dangerous cramp is in the
stomach. When that takes you your
breath goes, and you are not able to
shout for help or even to articulate
a sound. I have known of just two
cases among hundreds of thousands
of swimmers. When you get that
kind of cramp you may as well say
your prayers, but you won’t get it
if you don’t eat for two hours before
going into the water. Professional
swimmers go hungry half a day be
fore entering a race, and they never
know such a thing as a stomach
cramp.
If a bather in trouble would use
common sense he never would drown.
The belief is general that three times
under water for the drowning person
means crape and flowers. It's true if
you make the mistake of. .taking
water, for air. Hold your mouth shut
when.you are under water, and you'll
keep going down and coming up all
day. Don’t exhaust yourself strug
gling., .Relax every muscle and don’t
move,a hand. You’ll find that you’ll
never sink lower than your ears, and
that an _a. few seconds you’ll rise up
until, your, shoulders . are dry. You
can keep . on. doing, this indefinitely,,
but, of course, if you drink water
you’ll be weighted, and down you’ll
go..—New York Press.
