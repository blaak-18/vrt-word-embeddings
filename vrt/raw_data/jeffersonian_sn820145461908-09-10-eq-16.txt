BRYAN WANTS THE COIN.
A telegraphic dispatch from Fair
view last week stated that Bryan
needed five hundred thousand dol
lars to personally conduct his cam
paign and instead of taking some of
his government bonds and cashing
them he appealed to the beloved peo
ple to help him out.
Vfe need five hundred thousand
plunks,
We need them in our biz—
We want to buy the earth in chunks
And make the jackass sizz!
We want these plunks in lots of one
And two and five and ten —
Gadzooks—but don’t you need the
mon
When you go to buying men !
Os course we’re pure—as pure as
stone,
We’ll make the trusts retreat
By putting up one of our own
Down there on easy street.
Then come across, you sucker brave,
You dreamer and you chump,
Shell out your coin, then dig my
grave
And I will in it jump.
!
Os course, like one who lived before,
My bones shall rise again,
And then, sure Mike, I’ll run some
more,
And bleed you without pain!

THE CHEERY DISPOSITION.
The value of a cheery disposition
cannot be overestimated or dwelt
upon too often. There is a certain
inactive disposition that passes for
amiability, the individual not having
energy enough to become indignant
or to be fretful. There is also a
positive cheerfulness that is deter
mined to look on the bright side of
life through whatever discourage
ments present themselves. It is
fortunate for the house mother and
for her husband and for her chil
dren when she is possessed of an
actively cheerful disposition. It is a
sign of a kind heart and a firm de
termination to make others happy as
well as to be happy herself. The
cheerful woman will fill a dozen
causes for congratulation in events
which to others have a sinister look.
A week of rain keeps her i\t home
from a long anticipated visit, but
she will tell you, she undoubtedly
makes herself believe it, that is is
‘ fortunate, ” for the season of
quiet has given her a chance to finish
a quantity of sewing or to do some
special preserving she was anxious
to have done. —Good Housekeeping.
In answer to the Knoxville Senti
nel’s inquiry, “Who is Ilisgen?”
Why, Mr. John Temple Graves’ run
ning mate, of course. —Greensboro
Herald-Journal (Georgia).
It is suggested that the highly suc
cessful financiers of Count Zeppelin’s
relief fund might take a flyer in aid
of Mr. Bryan. He needs it.—Buffalo
(N. Y.) Evening News.
Mr. Bryan is about to exhibit his
possession of one qualification for the
Presidency, an unflagging lung power.
—Deadwood Pioneer Tinies (South
Dakota).
Say, Mr. Farmer!
Never before in the history of our
country has there been a time when
scientific farming received more at
tention than it is receiving at the
present time. It behooves every man
selecting farming as an occupation to
avail himself of every opportunity to
keep abreast of the time. It is also
necessary for his wife to know the
“ins and outs” of her department—the
home —in order that both may work
systematically. It is every man’s
duty to post himself in all the differ
ent features of farm life and to do so
he must have the right kind of litera
ture. His wife must also have some
thing for her department, and to
these ends the Texas Farmer, a week
ly larm journal, stands without a peer.
This journal should go into every far
mer’s home every week. For the pur
pose of putting it there we are going
to make an unheard of offer, an offer
that will not hold good after October 1
because the price and what we offer is
too ridiculously low for us to continue
it and make good.
We will send the Texas farmer and
the National Home Journal, both, one
year for 95 cents; the publisher’s price
being $1.50. As an inducement for you
to hurry in your subscription we will
give to each of the first 7,000 sub
scribers one share in a well we are
going to bore for oil in an oil district
on on a 2,000 acre lease. If we get oil,
both the least and the well will belong
absolutely to these 7,000 subscribers
and will mean at least one or two
thousand dollars to each of them.
If the oil is found to exist in paying
quantities a company will then be or
ganized by us and each subscriber is
to pay in sll more. One of which is
to go to us for our part in carrying
the proposition through to a success
ful issue, and the other ten is to go
into the treasury of the new com
pany for developing purposes; in other
words, to bore more wells on the lease
and conduct the business of the com
pany in general. The well does not
cost tae subscribers one cent. We are
depositing with the First State Bank
of Dallas, to the credit of a trustee, 35
cents out of the amount received from
every subscriber for the purpose of
boring the well. If we get oil, and
we are going to bore in an oil district,
each subscriber’s share will be worth
one or two thousand dollars and he
will not then mind paying in the
other sll which will develop it and
make it worth much more to him.
REMEMBER, WE ARE AFTER
THESE 7,000 SUBSCRIBERS AND
WANT THEM WITHIN THE NEXT
SIXTY DAYS and will send these
papers at this price until October 1 in
effort to get them by that time if
possible. Don’t lost any time study
ing over the matter, as the well does
not cost you one cent unless we get
oil, and if we do strike it just sll is
all it will cost you afterward. Only
one share is allowed to one person,
which makes it a “square deal” for all
alike. Hurry in your subscription to
day and both the papers will be sent
you for one year and also a certificate
f;r your share in the well. Send
money by any safe means, but no pri
vate checks will be accepted unless
ten cents is added for collection.
Hurry up and get in on time.
