VINEGAR BITTERS.
Grateful Thousands proclaim
Vinkgak Hitters tho most wonder
ful Invigorant that over sustained
tho siMkiug system.
No Person can take these Hit
ters according to directions, and ro
main Ion? unwell, provided tlioir
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and. vital or
gans wasted berood repair.
]{ilious, keinittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which aro so
prevalent in tho valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially tlioso of tho Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Rod, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during tho
Summerand Autumn,and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
beat and dryness, aro invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of tho stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In tlioir
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon tlieso vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Dit. J. W alker's VT neuak
ItiTTKRs, as tlioy will spnodily reinovo
tho dark -colored viscid matter with which
the bowels aro loaded, at the saino time
stimulating tho secretions of tho liver,
and generally restoring tho healthy func
tions of tho digestive organs. ,
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
Vinkgar JtiTTKKs. No epidemic can
tako hold of a system thus lore-armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, iiead
ftche, I'aiu in tho Shoulders, Coughs,
Tightness of the Chest, Dizziness, Sour
Eructations of the Stomach, Had Tasto
in the Mouth. Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of tho Licart, Inflammation of tho
Lungs, I'aiu in the region of tho Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
uro the offsprings of Dyspepsia. Ono bot
tlo will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
.Scrofula, or King's Evil, Whlto
Swellings, Ulcors, Erysipelas, Swelled
Keck, Goitre, Scrofulous Inflammations,
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of tho Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, Waikkk's Vih
K uau H ittkhs have shown their great cur
ative powers in tho most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For I ii Ham ma tory and Cli ron ic
It IlCllilüil ism, Gout, Hilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of tho Wood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis—
cu.s«e are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mcchanical Diseases.—Persons
engaged in Paint* and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Aliuors, as they advanco in life, aro sub
ject to paralysis of tho Bowels. To guard
against this, tako a doso of Walker's
Yinkoar Hittkrs occasionally.
For Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt- Klieum, Blotches, Spots, Pim
ples, Pustiilos, Boils, Carbuncles, King
worms, Scald-head, Sore Eyos, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurfs, Discolorations of tho
Skjn, llumors and Diseases of tho Skin of
whatever name or nature, aro literally
dug up und carried out of the system iu a
short time by tho uso of these Bitters.
Fin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, aro effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, 110 ver
mifuges, 110 anthclminitics will free tho
system from worms like those Bitters.
For Female Complaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, or tho turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decidcd an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse tho Vitiated Jilood
whenever yon find its impurities bursting
through tho skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores ; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in tho veins; cleanse
it when it is foul ; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and tho
health of tho svstem will follow.
