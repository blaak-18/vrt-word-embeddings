ornme Industries.
We heard a gentleman remaik the
other day that artistic laborers anod
mechanics were not appreciated here
in Louisiana as they should be;
"id cited instances which proved
conclusively the truthfulness of his
assertions.
We build, we spin and toil, with
botches and "roughs" at home, but
when we want any thing that looks
decent and neat, New Oileans or St.
Louis is the on!l place it can be had.
Let any carpenter, blacksmith, paint
er, wheelight, or printer do artistic
work here, far superior to the slim,
good looking, gauzy jobs of the
Northern workman, that is made to
sell, and nine of ten of our people
will pronounce it indfferent, good
and cheap, but that New Orleans or
St. Louis, or New York is the place
for such work.
This is the reason why our country
is down and is no more prosperous.
This is the reason why we buy every
thing we eat and wear and use. Our
people produce nothing, absolutely
nothing, and if any poor artistic work
man attempts to establish at home a
competition against outside manufac
ture, and produces articles of use bet
ter in looks, and more lasting, hle is
sneered down because it "don't look
like New York or Chicago."
This is all wrong, and shows a
spirit far from that which is re
quired to "build up" a country. We
must patronize home industry, even
if it costs a little more, for the money
thus spent remains with us, while
that sent away, stays away, and goes
to "build up" some other locality.
Louisiana has built a thousand
Northern Manufacturing towns, while
she has not laid the foundation for a
single shop in her own borders.
Think of that gentlemen, and mend
your ways.

Things Worth Knowing.
To Rid a House of Rats.-Wet a
few pounds of unslacked hlime with
strong lye made from potash; ;et it
be quite soft; spread it around the
holes so that the rate cannot avoid
treading in it ; let it remain a week
or so, and if it gets dry serape it off
'and moisten again. The mixture
burns their feet, and they will not be
likely to make a second visit. Do
not let it come in contact with oil
cloth or paint.
Black Robch Trap.-Fil) an earth.
en or tin wash-basin three parts full
of water sweetened with molasses,
wetting the edge with the same;
wrap a cloth around it in such a way
that the roaches can easily erawl up;
and ironing blanket answers the pur
pose well; set it on theim kitchen loor
on retiring, and the result will be
satisfactory. This may woek for
water-bugs as well.
To Restore the Hair After lDl8ess.
-Equal parts et best brandy and
strong black tea, shaken well to
gether, and rubbed well into the
roots of the hair once daily.v, will
usually restore the hair after long ill
ness. Be careful not to scratch or
irritate the scalp with rough combing
or brushing. The mixture should be
made at least once in three days,
even in cool weather.
For Sore Throat.-Gargle milk as
hot as the throat will bear it. Chlo
ride of potash, sold in a powder by
the druggists, is a good remedy. It
alay be occasionally taken by putting
on the tongae as much as one can
hold between two fingers and4 grad
ually awallo*ing it.
To Recover the Cnd.-For cattle
that ean net raise their cud, hold
threeor four at a timkne of ordinary
ised stalks of white pithed eklder be
tween the griders - pass them up as
they grind them ; keep the animals
grinding the elders hK tea or fifteen
uminutes; then put some small ears of
corn or a little hay into their month..
Few, if any eases ocour that a timely
.pplieation will not care. Cattle
, Lat have lost their cut are not likely
to take food into their Paouths.-Cor.

Fashion Notes.
Worth, it is said, is making many
bodices with round waist and Queen
Ilortense band, which is in satin, and
fast-tne(l with either a crystal or steel
buckle.
There are many new neckties. Thie
soft silk ones have a f'inge of the
same all aronad, while some, with
cream embhroidered haptiste centres,
have colored silk borders,
Robes or morning gowns are made
of botlh white surah and white serge,
and are trimmed with colored lace,
and have waist-coat wade entirely of
ribben.
New polonaises are made with
Breton vests and square collars, and
ti inimed with hands of embroidery.
Sleeveless sicques are sent out with
French polonaises as part of the
suit ; these are slightly loose and are
straight in effect like the French
walking jacket.
Edges cut in scallops or in sharp
points, so much in vogue several
years ago, are again adopted very
frequently. Sometienws trhe seallolps
or points are edged with a cording of
a diftitrent color, sometimes a flounce
of diflierent material Is set under the
scallops ; in a word these scallops
may be employed in combinations
with trimmings of every kind.
Bunting parasols are a novelty to
he otffered for spring and sumrmer use.
They are made of navy blue or white
bunting, with canopy shaped tops, a
ring and bow to close them, and
sticks of bamboo. For trimming
around the edge loops of ribbon half
an inch wide are arranged, or else the
ribbon hangs like a fringe, and is
finished at the edge with a button or
tassel.
Another favomite material for spring
wear is a woolen fabric called "nei
geuse diamautee." It is produced in
all colors, and is studded with tiny
brilliant silk dots, which give the
name diamaunteo to the stuff. In
chestnut brown and cigar brown,
dotted with red and white, it is par
ticularly suited to morning costumes,
the pipings being of silk to match the
dots.
rn collars and fichurs there are de
cided novelties; many collars of the
Louis XIII, form, which is decidedly
large; the onaterial used is tiue ba
tiste, and the border is either white
or ecru embroidery, so worked that
toe design appears to be sculptured
out of the cambric. The most dressy
collars are made of exceedingly fine
muslin, and encitled with colored
lace of an antique style, generally
pale blue or crimson. The ctffs,
which are worn above the close fitting
sleeves, match the collar.
Spring Fashions in Paris.
Philadelphia Telegraph's Paris Cor.
The weather is very charming, and
new dresses and bonnets abound in
the windows, though as yet but few
have come into wear. The new
"Torchon" or "Virginie" barege
seems to be the material most in
vogue for street costumes, and dark
brown the most fashionable color for
such wear. The newest brown,
which is very dark, is known by the
old name of "tete de negre," literally
"niggerhead." It has one advantage
-namuely, that of looking well with
all the new and fashienable shades of
yellow, which are the rage for bounet
trimming. A very pale blue is also
much worn on bonnets, and is the
only tint in fashion that is suitable
for blondes, that once popular type
of beauty having a hard time of it
now-a-days in the prevailing rage for
reds and and yellows. Bonnetstrings
of tulle will be much worn, both in
black and white, and, as they are
universally becoming to the face and
very easily renewed, I can imagine
that they are destined to a long popu
larity. Lace, both black and white,
will also be much used for the same
purpose. Jet is coming largely into
vogue, both on bonnets and in dress
trimmings. In stockings, solid colors
are considered the best style, though
cross barred ones in silk are the new
est. Orange silk stockings with
stripes of black lace inserted set up
the instep and either side of the an
kle are very elegant, and look well
with black dresses. Fine silk stock
ings, embroidered on the instep in
tints to match tine toilet, are beauti
ful and tasteful. It is now thie style
to wear these fancy stockings anrid low,
thin slippers when out driving, the
weareo's dress and attitude being so
arranged as to show off the foot and
its dainty covering. The last novel
ty in Parisian umbrellas may be des
cribed as truly horrible. They are of
orange silk lined with dark red. The
effl'eet upou the complexion can bet
ter be imagined than described. The
milliners and dress-makers are strug
gling wildly with mandarine, the uni
versal unbecomingness of that btil
iHant tint making it hard to popular
ize. But by dint of trimming with it
the crowns of bonnets and the back
breadths of dresses only, they con
trive to introduce it to a considerable
extent. It looks very well with cream
color when not too much of it is used.
Bat when mixed with light blue, as
I ha'e occasionally seen it, the effect
is very dreadful.
Tanning Skins at IIome-Cheap
Process.-The common dog fennel,
wild camomile, or bitter weed, the
same that when eaten by cows makes
milk bitter, is eqaul to oak or hem
lock bark for tanning purposes. A
common molasses or pork barrel may
be used as a tannoing vat. Saw a
molasses barrel in two, put iron or
large wire Ihoops on it, give it a coat.
ing of coal tar or pitch, and it will
last forever--nearly.
Soak calf, deer, sheep, coon or dog
skins, or any other skins, in lime
water to take the hair off, or tan
them with the hair on.
There are thousands of worthless
dogs whose skins, tanned in a decoc
tion of this now worthless weed, ad
ding a little alum, would benefit the
farmers and save the sheep, and at
the same time take the bitter weed
out of the way of the cows.-N. 0,
Picayane.
To Cleanse the Head.-A dime's
worth of pulverized borax, dissolved
thoronghly in a pint of water, Cleanse
the hbead especially the partings,
once a week, afterwards rinsing with
cold water. Will keep the head very
clean, and impart a glossy look to
the hair, especially if each applica.
tion is followed by a vigorous brush
inrg.

Dear Sir:-When in Aiken, last winter, I used your

COTTON GIN "
PATENTI'ED JULY 1 .173.
PRICE REDUCED
TO $4 50 PER SAW. º
TIIIS GIN has been in use for the past
three seasons, and several recent im
prnovements have been added. It obvi.
ates all friction at the ends of the cotton
box, preventh the roll from braking, and
giv& s a LARGER YIELD OF LINT from
the same amount of Seed than any other
Gin in use. The Revolving head light
ens the draft and causes the Gin to run
faster with less driving power, thus do
ing a great deal more work within the
same time, while economizing vteanm or
animal power, than any other G in. The
seed being ginned very close, the length
of the staple is increased, producing cot
ton on this account of a greater market
value. This improved value, given by
length of staple, with extra production
of lint, added to increased amount of
work done, more than covers the cost
of the Gin in every 1010 bales ginned.
