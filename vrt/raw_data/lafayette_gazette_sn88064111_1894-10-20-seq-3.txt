Distriict Court.
Judge Allen adjourned court last
Tuesday after disposing of twenty
four ctiminal cases, pleas of guilty
being entered in all them, except in
the case of Melancon, who was tried
by a Jury and convicted. All .the
prisoners were sentenced Saturday
with the exception of Melancon,
who received his sentence Tuesday.
During his trial Melancon stood
the ordeal with apparent- sang-froid
and manifested little or no anxiety,
but when.the jury returned a ver
dict of guilty, he broke down and
cried, and when taken to jail, he
presented a pitiful sight. His neat
.attire and downcast look offered a
striking'contrast when seen in the
jail with his ragged cellmates, who
seemed indifferent to their own fate,
while showing much sympathy for
their new companion.
The following parties were sen
tenced to the penitentiary: Leonce
Perron, larcetay, 9 months; Joseph
McCoy, 'larceny, r year; Joseph
Broussard, larceny, 9 months; Louis
•Jean Baptiste, larceny, x year;
Eraste Baptiste, larceny 9 months;

Mitchell's Capture.
The Gazette is not given to prais
ing anybo',y for performing his sworn
duty, but when an officer shows the
zeal and detective skill displayed by
Sheriff Broussard in the capture of.
Mitchell, the murderer, it considers
itself duty-bound to record the fact
and to give credit where it is due.
Through the efforts of Sheriff Brous
sard, .principally, one of the most
desperate criminals in the country
has been caught sixteen years after
the commission of his crime and
brought back to stand trial. Mitch- I
ell arrived Tuesday at the depot at'
this place in the custody of Sheriffs
Reid and Broussard. Sheriff Brous
sard stopped here while Sheriff Reid
continued with the prisoner to Lake
Charles where there is an.accusation
of murder against him. Sheriff
Reid stated to a Gazette reporter
that eye-witnesses to the murder of
which Mitchell is charged are still
living, and it is believed that it will
be an easy matter to prove his guilt.
He killed a man named Guidry
about sixteen years ago and since
then he has lived in different parts
of Texas, finally moving with his
Sfamily to Leesburg, Fla., where he
had accumulated a considerable
amount of property.
A number of people entered the.
car Tuesday to take a look at,
Mitchell. Among those who saw,
him were several who had known
irn in this parish twenty years ago.
He was quiet and had nothing to
'say to anyone. I-e is about 40 or
45 years of age, of small built has a
keen eye and lo,)ks very intelligent.
Mitchell has a son in the jail of this
parish, serving a sentence of three
months' imprisonment for having
horse-whipped a man. iHe is a
bright ladi and it is to be hoped that
his prtesent punishment will-serve as

DRi. FELIX C. LATIOLALS.
It'becomnes our painful .luty" to
chronicle the death of Dr. Felix C.
Latiolais, one of our best and most
widely known citizens, who died at
his home in Broussardville last
Thursday, surrounded by his family
and numerous friends. The la
mented doctor had been very ill
several days preceCding his death,
and bore his sufferings with Chris
tian fortitude and resignation.
Dr. Latiolais was born in this
parish 43 years ago, and resided
here continuously to the time of his
death. He was an honored de
scendant of one of the oldest fami
lies of this section. Among the first
settlers in Louisiana was his great
grandfather, who founded an insti
tution of learning known as the
"Coquelin College," in New Or
leans, when that metropolis had not
yet grown to the size of a city.
The paternal grandfather of the"
doctor served as a soldier in the
battle of New Orleans,.and was se
lected by Gen. Jackson among, many
daring men to carry a very impor
tant dispatch, which he successfully
transmitted as directed by that *fa
mous commander.
. Fromrnhis earliest manhood uDoc
tor Latiolais sh'owed a very decided
taste.for th.e profession of mcdicins,
which he -subsequently followed.
By constant application to his
studies and devotion to the profes
sion of his choice, he had estab
c lished a very lucrative practice, a'rd
was recogriized as one of the leading
and most successful physicians in
.this parish.
Felix Latiolais was a man of
very pronounced characteristics;
open and fearless in his convictions
and capable of the truest friend
ship. .In .politics no one ever had
t reason to doubt his sincerity in the
cause that he espoused, as he always
enlisted himself with his whole heart
; and his whole mind. As a citi
i zen he never shirked his
t duties, however irksome they
t might be. At tJ~e time of his
I death he was chairman of the Dem
ocratic Executive committee, and
resolutions passed by that body .ex
pressive of his sterling worth,
shows the high esteem in which he
was held by his fellow-Democrats.
t This distinguished citizen, good
father and husband, was daily grow
ing in the love, -respect and confi
dence of his countrymen, when the
untimely summons gathered him-to
fathers, and well may those who
knew him sincerely regret his depar
- ure. Death is always sad, but ssad
Sder still when it takes away one in
the prime of manhood and in .the
'days of his usefulness.
Dr, Latiolais w\as buried ,ester
- day in the Catholic grave-yard. ;be
ing laid to rest in tioe presence of a
vast concoui se of friends and rel
atives.

PINHOOK, LA., Oct. 16, 1894.
Editor Lafayettte Gazette:
In a monarchy laws are made :by
-the monarch or by the aristocracy,
which is the main support of thC
crown, and the masses of the peo
ple are governed by these laws, the
:part of the subject being to obey.
In a republic the people are .or
I ought to be the sovereign and they
should make the laws to govern
themselves. These laws are to be
made by the people through the.ir
representatives selected by them
for that purpose. Therefore, the
most impo: tant duty the citizen of
a repubhlic is called upon to per
form is to select, by the exercise of
his vote, the representative entrusted
with the law-making power. Now,
the experience of the world has
proved that wealth begets the worst
kind of aristocracy-the arrstocracy
of moniey, which has always been
destructive of republican institu
tions. From this, Mr. Editor, it
i strikes me, a plain and unpreten
tious farmer, that the millionaires
are not the right men to be entrusted
witlh the law-making power. They
live and mox-e withii a social circle
of their own; and conseque~ntly
know nothing of the habits and cus
tomns if thie toiling nmasses, anti far
less of their wants. It seetms to Ile
it would be wiser to seek. our las
makers in the ranks of men who
mix with the people; mnen who feel
the sanie wants. and who necessarily
svympatlhize with thern. Omice uipon
atime thetre was no Croesus in the

Wright, Felix Grundy, were all men
of moderate means, and had no
"barr'l." They served their coun
try with honor and distinction on
an average of a quarter of .a cent
ury, and died if not poor, certainly
not rich. Things have .changed;
today there is piled up in each of
the seats once occuliied by" those
great men one or more million .dol
lars. Under such conditions is it
surprising that the country is fast
falling under the influence of the
money power of the corporations
and trusts. It is time to call a halt
and send men to Congress who are
commendable for honesty, patriot
ism and capacity. I do not pre
tend to say that a millionaire does
not love his country, but from what
little knowledge I have of human
nature, you will excuse me for say
ing that I believe he loves his mil
lions more. OLD TIMIER.
