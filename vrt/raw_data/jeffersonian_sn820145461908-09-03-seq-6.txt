“My dear Niece:
4 4 You can come if you want to, but
if you do, you must leave your city
airs and finery (I suppose you have
them, like the rest) where you are.
Folks here are plain, sensible people,
and I won’t have another niece of
mine making herself ridiculous, as
your cousin Lucile did last year.
44 1 am glad you did not write to me
with that new-fangled machine you
use in writing stuff for the papers.
I had as soon get a letter from my
old cook-stove. I think we shall get
along very well together, so, if you
really want to spend a quiet summer
with a lonely old woman, let me know
when to expect you.
“Your affectionate aunt,
41 Rebecca Wetherby. ’ ’
Leona Darrell was a young woman of
unusual adaptability and common
sense, and she smiled as she laid down
the somewhat ungracious epistle. (She
did want to go, and she intended to
make good her assertion that, in spite
of Miss Rebecca’s peculiarities, she
could spend a happy and peaceful
summer with her —a thing which few
of her nieces had attempted, and
which none had, as yet, ever accom
plished.
Leona closed the despised “new
fangled machine,’’ put her papers
carefully away in the desk, selected
and packed the plainest articles of
her not very extensive wardrobe, and
the close of the following week found
her settled in Miss Rebecca’s quiet
little home, where the click of the
typewriter and the sending and re
ceiving of long, bulky envelopes
seemed things impossible.
During the next few days, Leona
devoted herself to a close, though
covert, study of Daleham fashions,
for Daleham had fashions peculiarly
its own. Then she went to the village
store and bought material for gowns
similar to those worn by the lassies
of the neighborhood, and these she
proceeded to make in accordance with
prevailing styles, succeeding in a
way which won unusual commendation
from her aunt, and went far toward
the successful carrying out of her
summer program.
“I wish you would walk over to
Mr. Thompson’s and pay my milk
bill,” Miss Rebecca said one morn
ing; “I don’t like to trust the money
to the boy who brings the milk.”
Leona gladly assented, and listened
patiently to her aunt’s lengthy ex
planation of just how the account
stood. “I haven’t anything less than
live dollars,” Miss Rebecca conclud
ed, “so be sure you don’t lose the
change. ’ ’
Smiling over this caution, Leona
went out into the fresh morning air,
rejoicing in the half-mile of sunshine
which lay before her. There was not
a human being in sight, and she
walked briskly along, humming gay
ly to herself, until she reached a
bend in the road, just beyond which,
and hidden by a clump of trees, was
her destination.
Suddenly, a man with a repulsive
face and tattered clothes emerged
from behind tree and stood directly
in her way,
WHEN THE MUSE IS AW A Y
“I’ll trouble you for that pocket
book, ”• he said insolently.
Leona’s heart almost stopped beat
ing, but she was no coward even when
the odds were against her, and she
put the purse resolutely behind her.
“It isn’t mine,” she said, steady
ing her voice by sheer force of will;
“and, besides, if you want money, it
would be better for you to get it in
a more honest way.”
“Oh, Miss Preacher,” he sneered,
44 it’s a wonder your congregation will
let you off even on week days! If
you ain’t goin’ to give me that mon
ey, I guess I can take it,” he added
savagely, and stepping forward, he
seized her wrist with a grip that made
her dizzy with pain.
Then something darted past her;
the grip on her wrist was released,
and when the mist cleared away from
before her eyes, she saw the tramp
lying prostrate in the dust, while a
man in blue overalls and big straw
hat stood menacingly over him.
4 4 Now, get up and take yourself
off.”
The tramp rose slowly in obedience
to the command, and shuffled down
the road, muttering as he went.
After watching him for a few min
utes, Leona’s rescuer came over to
where she sat by the roadside, trying
to regain her composure.
“I hope the rascal didn’t hurt
you,” he said, with some concern;
44 isn’t your wrist bruised?”
44 0 h, it is nothing,” she assured,
him, “but I think I should have died
if you hadn’t come.”
“I don’t think we need a formal
introduction,” he said, after they had
talked for several minutes; 44 1 am
Gilbert Murray, an unworthy nephew
of Mr. Benjamin Thompson.”
44 My name is Darrell,” she said,
smiling, 4 4 and I am supposed to be
on my way to your uncle’s to pay a
bill for my Aunt Rebecca Wetherby.
1 think I can go on now; I have hu
mored my silly fright quite long
enough. ’ ’
When Leona had done her errand
and was about to start home, she
found Murray again at her side. 44 1
am going your way,” he said easily,
4 4 so, if you don’t mind, we ’ll go along
together. ’ ’
He had divested himself of his big
hat and overalls, and now Leona no
ticed that he was a man of very
pleasing appearance, evidently not far
on either side of thirty; and as they
walked back over the road she had
come that morning, she found in her
rustic knight a suprisingly interesting
companion.
From this time, a new element was
introduced into Leona’s carefully
planned summer —an element which
had no place in the plan itself, and
which had its personification in Gil
bert Murray.
At first, she plainly discouraged his
attentions, having', on several occa
sions heard her aunt express unqual
ified disapproval of 4 4 the way young
folks act now-a-days,” and not wish
ing to do anything which might incur
her displeasure.

44 Why didn’t you go to the picnic
with that young man?” Miss Rebec
ca asked one day, after Leona had de
clined the invitation in her presence.
44 I’m very glad to see you careful
about whom you go with, but I 4 knbw
the nest the bird is from,’ as the say
ing goes, and his people are all good,
honest folks.”
Leona made some evasive answer
regarding the picnic, but she took
■her cue, and Murray found smoother
sailing in consequence.
As the days glided by, it seemed
to the girl that her work and real
self were alike blotted out, and that
she had slipped back into the time
when life was lived in all its sim
plicity and sweetness; and, yielding
to this fancy, she pushed the present
far out of her thoughts, and dreamed
and drifted with tire tide of her
imagination. Murray in no way dis
turbed these dreams: indeed, he
seemed rather to belong to them, hav
ing first appeared upon the scene in
the role most approved in the old
chivalrous days, and afterwards pay
ing his court in strict orthodox fash
ion, always promptly taking his
leave when the winding of the big
clock announced that Miss Rebecca
thought it time to retire, and treat
ing that lady herself with a courte
ous deference which firmly establish
ed him in a high place in her good
graces. The quaint, sedate life of the
village; Miss Rebecca and her prim
little home, which alike bore the
stamp of five decades before; the sage
and lavender, pinks, marigolds, and
verbenas in the old-fashioned gar-
Ten- —all seemed to blend in one
sweet, harmonious whole, and Leona
found this playing at being one’s
own grandmother, as it were, intense
ly fascinating.
But time will not long be ig
nored, and one night Leona awoke
to the realization that only a single
week of her vacation remained. It
came to her with a. shock, rudely
brushing away the cobweb of fan
cies with which she had surrounded
herself, and as, with that clearness
of comprehension which characteriz
ed her in matters of real life, she
looked back over the past weeks, it
was more and more strongly borne
in upon her that what she had ac
cepted merely as a part of her make
believe world, while allowing her im
agination to run riot, was a most
serious reality to Gilbert Murray.
She was no coquette, and she bitter
ly reproached herself for the selfish
thoughtlessness in permitting affairs
to drift into the state in which, from
numberless incidents which recurred
to her mind, she plainly saw them to
be. She was by no means without
experience as a woman of the world,
but somehow this case seemed differ
ent from the rest, and the fact that
Murray was, as she knew, far above
the other men of the community in
intelligence, and possessed of quali
ties which commanded her entire res
pect, only made her blame herself
more for having made him the vic
tim of her childish whim, She tried
U-liAj i * * - W
to think that perlhaps he, too, had
been carried on by t\je dreamy sum
mer days, and that, anyway, he
would soon forget, but cshe failed to
gain much comfort frons these pos
sibilities.
It was with a pang that Leona
noted the glow which came into Gil
bert Murray’s eyes next morning, as
she ctame out on the porch where he
was waiting to accompany her on an
expedition in search of some wood
ferns for Miss Rebecca. During the
walk, Leona’s mind was a chaos of
conflicting emotions, but she made an
effort to chat and laugh as usual,
though the manner with which her
companion regarded her from time to
time told her that her efforts were
not entirely successful, and made
the task harder by convincing her
more firmly of his attitude towai ds
her.
“I believe you are tired,” Murray
said, solicitously, after the ferns had
been secured, 4 4 let me help you to a
seat on this bank; the emerald throne
awaits the queen.”
When she was seated, instead of
releasing the hand he had taken to
assist her, Murray clasped it in
both his own, and the next moment
Leona found herself listening to the
passionate declaration which she had
dreaded. Then another fact which
had come forth during the previous
night of introspection, only to be
driven back in half-fearful haste,
boldly asserted itself; and when, en
couraged by something in the eyes
momentarily raised to his, Murray
folded her in his arms, Leona did
not resist, for she knew that giving
up the rest of the great world and
the hope of a literary career was
but a trivial circumstance, if she
might stay within the reach of those
strong arms and the sound of the
voice, which was telling the old, old
story again and again. Farmhouse
or mansion, what did it matter, if
love was there?
4 4 Sweetheart, ” Murray said pres
ently, with some hesitation, “do
you think you would mind living in
the city?”
44 0 h, no!” she answered in sur
prise. “I’ve always lived there,
though I usually run away for a few
weeks in summer. But why do you
want to leave your home?”
44 Leave my home?” he repeated,
the surprise on her face reflected in
his own; 44 why, my work and home,
if a forlorn bachelor can be said to
have a home, are in the city. I was
rather out of sorts in the spring, and
came here to Uncle Ben’s to try the
simple life for awhile. It has work
ed wonders, and now I am ready for
work again. I am editor of the 4
Magazine.’ ”
Leona was convulsed with sudden
merriment. “Gilbert Murray!” she
(exclaimed. 44 0 f course! Oh, it is
{too funny! ”
4 4 But you —” he said in perplexi
ty; 44 1 thought—”
4 4 That I was a demure little
country girl, versed in all kinds of
domestic witchcraft, ’ ’ she supplied;
“and you wondered if I would bear
