Those Indictcments.
The exc itemtnt broright about ty I (
th, indietnment of Mat WVells and inen
Tomni Aiersti, for forging the e'er- ,
non parish ret urns. continues to grow s '
in volunme as it is dienossed. A great it
deal of unnecessary talk has been in- (
dulged in hby all parties, and even the it
Goverinor' conmes in fO'r a share of the
opinions upon the cave, which we ae tIhe
very sorry to see. The oftlrnse nlhiat' h id
Tom Anderson and Mat Wells corn
mitted, and for which they stand in - sc(it
dicted, is a criininal one proidedt for dhr
by onr statutes, conSeqtietttly this Mir.

We do not believe that Governor he l
Nicholls has ever exprllessed himself past
with regard to this cise. We do not the
for a mnionietlt thlink he has pionmised that
Wells and Andlerson ptriidon in tile fene
event of their conviction, which is tion
alinost certain-.for if w, did, then we snol
wonld believe that G(overnor Nicholls lieuI,
desired to make a repiutation for hini- 1 - o
self equally as odious as ,ell's antd leir
Anderson's. and
As to this "pledge and agreorncnt'' klin
business, we most emphatically de
ny that any was ever mentioned or r'i
entertained relating to Mat Wells or ult
Tom Anderson ; and we prodice in
this week's issne an interview had by -
the editor of the VINDICATOR with il'
C(ol. Witi. M. Levy, ex-membniller of and
congress from this district, who hadt the
as niich to do with the settliement of Ceog
the Louisiana dilicunlty as Mr. Nich- l'at
oils or any one else, and it will be trat
seen that if bat ginis were made, they fort
were latde witholt the knowledge of 'ied
our Congressional delegation or our trat
people, and were anea:led for as well the
as unliutlhortzed. tion
We renlembetr that when :8f0,t) titr
was "'grab hb!" ftotu the trens'v to P"
reward treason, hy pa: in r Packard's
emtiployees, this samrle dodge of ani lan
"agreement" was sprunig as a reason L Va
for it. Thli "lil'areemeniit'" dodl is ti
somnething like Simon Suggs' hettingj
rules, which no one but hiimself knew, I(ha
but when violated by an opponent, ces
that opponent was comlrpelled to fork and
over, while Sinion would blandly say: gi "
"That's agin my rules-pay up !", con
Thirty thousand dollars go out to pay Lou
Packard's hirelings and "agreement"' the
is whined out as an excuse for the 1
"take." Tom Anderson and Mat Stal
Wells are indicted for forgery and tion
"agreement" is to be their vindica- fore
tion. Well, let any man, be he gov- Con
ernor or not, dare interfere with the star
prosecution of the Returning Board antl
scamps. After they are covicted, if
Governor Nicholls desires to pardon halt
the felons ani d is piepared to stand otht
the odiumln of such an act, why lie is his
at perfect libel ty to do so. We say sole
in advance, however, that the peolel i
of I his State " will niever forgi e hiilm, t
and that lie need not exp(ect, if hie ask
does it, support front the honest citi- sIo
tens of Louisianan.
The Times and I'icalunle journals of
the "largest circulation in the South- ll
west"and the smallest political coin
stituency in the krnown world, seenti
moved to the depths with conlpassilon i"
for \'eils antul Anderson. l:vei before
these indictnlret ts were friitd those ca
palpers took Ull the guage of battle fot r
Wells under the thitest of pretexts- -a
that their pro.secution under thle law, I
was a pillitica.lpersecltion, "virolatigas

warned that neither of them repre- pal
sent Louisiana senitiment. If the tlhe
mass of Louisiana's people were dis- Ni
honest, then indeed would tlhe Timnes Co
andl Picagnne be fair exponents of tlhe
their views-lcar what is more dishon- dis
eat than the condoning of the otfenees all
of Mat Wells and Tomi Anderson. of
Evcry thief of radical pursnasion, st
according to the Picayune and Timnes m"S
should not be prosecuted .because it per
might be construed into political per- fot
secution by Mr. Hayesor Mr. Hayes' anl

cording to these astute journals, must pr(
continue in leading strings to sonime as

PLEDGES.-Linikiing tile Governor's cor
name with the Returning Board ex(
indictment case as somne journals pl
have done, is anything but creditable sta
to all parties--tlhe Governor and those me
journals. We remember that during co
the canvass Governor Nicholls made au
pledges to the people of this State the
that no 'guilty person cor'ricted of vie
crime should be pardoned by hint,! bI
'This pledge the governor remembers, for
and we feel assured, he does not pro- coa
pose to violate it, even in the interests wel

n- disperse the Sicholls goverrnment in

of General Grant, was refusecd. IHe
Sstate( to Messrs. Gibson, Ellis, andl
es myself, distinctly, that ie shouldl not,
it pending thle electoral count, interfere
.. for, or against eitlitr of the claim
s ants, that thie troops were instrictrd,
anrd should remain instrncted only to C
st preserve thie public peace, that as farl '
le as thIe armed occuplation or posses
Ssion of thie Couit building was con
cerned, it did not matelially diff- rL
lt from thie armnledl occupatiou or pos- e
he session of thIe State Honuse, and hris c
policy in this matter of thIe claim
ants fr thie State Government, was
r's containedl in the words "hands off,' a
rd except for preservation of peace and II
lh public order. General Grant further 0
le stated, (and hIe carried out his state- d
se ment) that as soon as tihe electoral n
g count was completed, lie would issue f;
ie an order directing the withdrawal of ti
te the United States troops, from the d
of vicinity of the State HIouse, to their (t
.! barracks. The reasons given by him ri
'8, for postpouing that order until the o
o- completion of thie electoral count Y
ts were; that, for political reasons, and ti
in nccordanoe with Lis views of pro-. ci
priety, the issuance of this order ser
pending the count might be miscon- int
stru('d by the two political parties, oul
and w hile neither of the Louisiana thei
a claimatnts would be disturbed by the pai
contitinuance of the Status in quo, the tee
delay could cause no serious inton- to
