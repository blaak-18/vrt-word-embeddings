OF INTEREST TO FARMERS
PARCEL POST.
How many know that there were
years when the parcel post rate in
this country was only half of what it
now is? In 1872 the postage rate
on merchandise was put at one cent
for each two ounces. However, the
weight limit of merchandise was only
twelve ounces. The weight limit of
books was put at four pounds and
the rate was the same—one cent for
each two ounces. In 1874, however
—remember the date—the weight
limit of third-class mail matter, mer
chandise included, was raised to four
pounds and the rate remained the
same—one cent for two ounces. The
express companies became alarmed.
They saw that this parcel post rate
would endanger their monopoly of
the small merchandise package car
rying trade and cut in on their enor
mous profits. No claim was made
that the postoffice was losing money
by carrying parcels for a cent for two
ounces, but the express companies se
cured, in 1875, the amendment of the
postoffice law and in this amendment
was incorporated a change of parcel
postage from one cent for two ounces
to one cent per ounce. This, it will
be seen, just doubled the parcel post
rate. The change in the parcel post
rate was slipped through Congress
almost without discussion. The ex
press companies and their hirelings
in Congress were careful not to
arouse the public. And that rate,
which has given the express compa
nies a monopoly of the small package
carrying trade and has permitted
them to make the most outrageous
charges, has remained in force ever
since.
It should be clearly understood
that our present parcel post is not
only far inferior to that of every
other civilized country, but that so
far as rate is concerned it is only one
half as good as it was more than
thirty years ago. And in no respect
is it better now than it was then.
The thievish express companies
have not only prevented us from hav
ing a proper parcel post; they have
succeeded in making our parcel post
far inferior to what it was thirty-five
years ago!
The powerful publishing interests
were indignant when they found that
by the amendment to the postal law
in 1875 the rate on third-class mat
ter had been doubled, and they made
so much trouble and had so much
influence, for they had wealth to com
mand, that in 1876 the postage rate
on books was reduced to what it had
been before —one cent for two
ounces.
In 1879 Congress made another
amendment to the postal law and
styled books as third-class postal
matter, and other merchandise as
fourth-class postal matter. And to
this day fourth-class pays the rate of
one cent an ounce.
The express companies get more
consideration from Congress than all
the rest of the people of the United
States get.—lllinois Farmer's Call,
Quincy, 111.
This is the time when the garden
ers, male and female, are immersed
in the 'question of seeds. It is the
vital question to all those who grow
for the home, as well as those who
grow for market, which latter class
is becoming larger from year to year,
as the farmer is coming to realize
that from his garden he can have
something to sell to keep up his table
and running expenses the year
around. There are still many farm
ers who regard the garden as a neces
sary evil, by which they are kept from
the necessity of buying food for their
tables, but an increasingly large class
have been converted to the fact that
the garden will, if properly managed,
give larger returns per acre than any
other portion of the farm.
Good Seeds.
In order to get good results we
must have good seed —seed that is
Obe Jeffersonian
not only pure as to name, but which
has vitality as well, and which has
been grown in a latitude which will
insure the maturity of the crops
where you are going to grow them.
It is a sure thing that garden peas, if
grown in Florida, would not do well
in the extreme Northern States, and
this fact is taken into account by all
first-class seedsmen, who have their
crops of seeds grown in the latitudes
where they do the best in order to
fulfill average conditions of growth in
the gardens of their customers. You
should consult the advertising col
umns of this paper for the names of
reliable dealers as such only are ad
mitted to our columns. Lay out this
month the whole garden scheme for
the next year. What you will grow
for home consumption. What your
customers favor, and the quantites
you can market at the highest prices,
and look for some choice novelties to
introduce to them. Keep their inter
est in your garden truck stimulated
by giving them nothing but the best
varieties of standard fruits and vege
tables, and an occasional new one,
which you have proved to be of value.
Send in your order for seeds early.
Keep a copy of it, and write on one
side of the paper only. When receiv
ed, check the packages against your
copy, and if any discrepancies are
found, write the seedsman, sending
along a copy of the order, land a list
of what you did receive, and what you
were over and short. In such cases
the seedsman will make a quick and
satisfactory adjustment of the com
plaint.
Hotbeds.
They should be made, if not al
ready done, and cold-frames gotten
in order. If you have a market for
hotbed or cold-frame lettuce or
radishes, sow them as early as pos
sible, using Grand Rapids lettuce,
and French breakfast radish, and
keep them at a regular heat, with
plenty of ventilation on bright sunny
days. The soil for hotbeds should
be as fine as sand. If it is heavy,
clayey loam, mix it with enough
sifted hard-coal ashes to make it
light and porous, using commercial
fertilizer as given in the last issue.
These crops need close watching
that they be kept picked out so they
do not crowd, but kept growing from
the first continuously.—Up-to-date
Farming, Indianapolis, Ind.
There is so much about parcel-post
in this issue that perhaps we ought
to apologize. But please consider
that this is now a very “live” topic,
that it is of very great interest to
farmers, and that now is indeed an
opportune time to awaken public in
terest. We print so much about par
cel-post because now is the best time
yet to get right after the Congress
man from your district and the Sen
ators from your State. Write them
today. Tell them that you are most
heartily in favor of a modern parcel
post and will watch how Congress
men and Senators vote. And that
you, too, will have a chance to vote
the next Congressional election.
And because it will not be so op
portune a month hence, we will not
in future issues have near so much
abut parcel-post.
It is our editorial policy to treat of
topics when they are timely.—lllinois

EARLY IRISH POTATOES.
For early Irish potatoes the Irish
Cobbler is now a very popular sort.
Plant these early in February, or
late in January, in furrows 2% feet
apart. Apply in the furrows 1,000
to 1,500 pounds of a fertilizer aver
aging 3 per cent, nitrogen, 8 per
cent, phosphoric acid, and 8 per cent,
potash—less potash in Gulf States —
and throw a furrow on it from each
side. Then plow the furrows again
so that the fertilizer will be . well
mixed in the soil. Go over with a
slant-tooth harrow before they come
up, to break any crust that forms,
and as soon as they are up, go over
them with a weeder both ways to
completely clean the crust and any
small weeds or grass that may start;
then cultivate rapidly with the culti
vator. A two-horse riding cultivator
is the best implement; it does the
work very well and rapidly and saves
human labor. Lay-by the crop with
a slight furrow to each side. —W. F.
Massey in Progressive Farmer.
FEED FOR SOWS.
The scarcity and high price of
hogs, and the high price of feed,
makes a general inquiry as to the
most profitable feed for hogs that are
going through the winter, especially
for brood sows. A good authority
is on record in favor of chopped corn
and wheat-bran, half and half, as be
ing the cheapest and best feed for
brood sows. Os course, if it is in
convenient or expensive to have the
corn ground, shelled corn and bran
may be mixed and slightly wet so
that the bran will stick to the corn.
We need not say that such feed
should be given in a trough so there
can be no waste. —Up to Date Farm
ing.
