Thi s ntetiaz as well as the ones
held at New Orleans and Memphis-,
was purely for edlueational pur
poses, and not to form any party
or party combline, and our radical
partisans on both sides should not
cry out against what they seem to
think is a political deal or fusion.
Great forces are now being set
in mnotion to arouse the people on
a leading plank in the Populist
platform and( a principle dear to
the hearts of thousand of the best
democrats-free silver, or the res
toration of the people's money,
and every one should assist in the
great work.
If free silver is a principle of
genuine democracy as is stoutly
claimed, deimocrats should not be
afraid to advocate it, and if it is a
loading plank in the Populist plat
form, certainly that party has
nothing to lose from its agitation
and the education of the masses
upon it. Let's all work for it, and
then stand by the party that is its
best friend.
The Republican party exists for the
sole purpose of affording the Dem
ocratic party something to bark at.
Our wonderful and versatile Po
lice Jury have contracted for the
building of a large, convenient and
elegant Courthouse, that will be
an honor and a pride to the citi
ens, but those of them who are
compelled to travel the public road
from here to St. Maurice, will con
tinue to curse that same police Ju
ry. Itis strange-passing strange,
that these men seem to be willing
to keep up the reputation of our
prish for thrift and progress on
other hmes, and yet leave our pub
lic highways absolutely impassable.
But then who could expect more
of an appointive police jury. If
they represented the people whom
they are suppo ed to serve, instead
at our narrowt-minded little Gov
er-ox, they w uld, of course, do
better.

they are sure to win if they do half

old fogies who believe the world
stands still and things will remain

PERSONAL MENTION.
Rev. J. C. Davis and Son, of Alpha,
calldl in to see us on last Saturday.
They are populists of the "old guard.'"
We had the pleasure of meeting Mr.
W. A. Ragan of ward 4, in our office
Tuesday.
The single-taxers from New Iberia, in
company with their friends of this place,
Messrs M. M. H. Carver and Clarance Pier
son, called on us Tuesday, and made
several minutes very pleasant for us.
They are Rev. C. C. Kramer, Messrs.
Jules 1)reyfuas, E. T. Weeks and - Me
Mahon, and are pleasant, intelligent and
well-read men, and able advocates of
the doctrine of fenry George.
Mr. J. O. Tanner moved his family
beck to his home In ward 5 this week,
where they will remain until the Nor
mal opens again in October. Mrs. Tan
ner a.d her daughter, Miss Florence,
will take a trip of two weeks visiting
relatives at and near Evergreei, before
going home.
Mr. C. E. Trichell one of our thriftiest
farmers in ward 1 paid us a pleasant
sall this week.
Mr. J. W. Jones of this ward was in
town Tuesday, Mr. Jones is one of the
old war horses of the People's party in
this parh and thinks that party will
largely increase its majority next April.
J. W. Baberm and his son Arthur, of
Barkley. pad us an appreciated call
Wednesday.
M. H. Holloway of Matston, called on
us Monday.
Miss Dos Rainey, daughter of Capt.
8. P Rainey, of Prov al, is spending
a few days in our city, the guest of the
isses Tncker.
We had intended to publish the
prceedings of the silver mass
held here last Saturday,
to get a copy in the her
ry to get them off to the daily pa
pers, and they were finally mislaid
in the shuffle so that the dailies did
not got them. However, we can
give a resume of the salient facts.
Mr. L. Chopin was mule Chair
man, with U. P. Breazeale and S.
J. Henry, as secretaries. A splen
did address was made by Col. W.
H. Jack, and a representative com
mittee on resolutions appointed.
The resolution unanimously
adopted were staightforward and
unequivocally for free coinage at
16 to 1, and no "parity" or inter
national agreement.
A large and representative dele
gation of farmers, business and
professional men was sclected to
tftend the New Orleans silver con
vention,
This meeting gives the silver
movement a splendid start off in
this parish.
Ward I* Pepalls Club.
We mislaid a letter from that
sterling populist of ward 10, W.
11. Russell, which we intended to
publish. Mr. Russell states that
they organized a club of 16 mem
bers in that ward near Derry, not
withstanding the rain which fell
all the day on which they organ
ized. With a,good club at Chopin
ward 10 will be safe. The boys are
getting in fghting trim all over
the parish. These clubs are only
beginning and before election they
will contain all the way from a
is.joeity to 9-tenths of the voters of
Se respective wards, and as there
is no possible way of defeating the
will of organized mqjorities the
Peopls prit will be absolutely
rsaf to thI posiahl.
