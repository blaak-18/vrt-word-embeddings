T.Ihe people were in hopes that
the-present Legislature would pass
some measure to protect them against
the greed of the railroad companies,
bun eree sadly disappointed to hear
that the House railroad committee
which met in Baton Rouge Wednes
day decided by a vote of eight to
two to report unfavorably the bill
introduced by Mr. Mouton, of this
parish, for the establishment of a
tailroact commission such as exists
in most of the States of the union.
Louisiana needs a railroad com
oission. The people have been
bled by high railroad freight
ehutges long enough. The exis
tence of a railroad commission
law would not prevent the con
struction of new roads, and it
would force the managers of those
now in operation to deal fairly and
honestly with their patrons.-Mans
field Democrat-Journal.
The only way by which to retain
and perpetuate good government in
these days of alleged general cor
iuption, is to point the finger of in
ecable scorn and public indignation
at every man whose character and
record are smirched, and permit no
one to reach an altitude beyond
their reach. Let truth proclaim
the culprit and then fearlessly render I
judgment.-Shreveport Times.
The proposition to increase the
salary of future governors to $So- a
@oo a year will not meet with the
approval of the people of Louisiana.
Large States like New York and
Pennsylvantia pay their chief execu- r
tives Sio,ooo. Many able men can
be found willing to accept the posi- c
tion for less than the salary pro
posed. It may be well to increase t
the governor's salary, but Si o, 000oo
is too much.
Sam Jones sums up the situation z
as follows: "I have quit fighting c
the democrats or the republicans. I
It won't pay to fight a democrat.
Their hides are not worth ten cents ¬
apiece in any market in the world, <
and skinning a republican is surely c
like skinning a skunk. His hide
won't bring enough to pay for the t
deodorizer to remove the stink." I
AsSam does not give his opinion of
the Populist's hide it is inferred i
that the P. P. man is too tough to be <
skinned at all.
The estate of the late Jesse Selig- <
Sman, which aggregates nearly $3,

will between forty societies and

he made of his vast property illus
trates not only the growth of human
philanthropy in the world but the
.rpid development of a more liberal
spirit among the religious organiza
tions which were formerly strangers
to each other.-Kansas City Star.

It is a well ktfswi fac t which o one
wil deny that for years election in
so~se parts of the State have been a
di~'e and a shabaae.
We, of Lafayette, have been ex
ceptionaUy fostunate in this respect,
and be it said to the credit of our
people, tbtthbey have always looked
with horror upon illegal voting and
false returns.
Every honest man in Louisiana is
anxious to see some good, strong
law enacted by the Legislature.
One that will precihde the possibility
of a recurrence of the election 1
frauds which have been committed
by unscrupulous men in some
parishes of the State. "
Unless some stringent measure is
passed it will not be long before
ballot-box stuffing will become a
legitimate occupation in Louisiana.
So accustomed are the people to the
cry of "election frauds and ballot
box stuffing" that newspapers never
fail to charge,with or without reason,
that the victorious candidate has
been *"conuted in." Nobody is
thought to be too honest to accept
a stolen office. High officials are
charged, with the greatest sang frold,
of being experts in the art of "coun
tug in" and "counting out". And
so frequent have these charges been
made and so little importance are
given to them by the people that
seldom the accused takes the trouble
to deny them. If something is not
done, it does not take a prophet to
foretell what will be the out-come.
It is reported in New Orleans that
a large number of the respectable )
citizens of that city refuse to go to I
the polls and vote because the 'boss' l
makes the return to suit himself S
without the least regard for the y
wish of the majority.
Now is the time to act. Let our I
law makers put aside all questions a
of faction. The people care not ii
who are the mYmnbers of the com
mittee, or where thy live, or who
they supported for governor at the
last election. What they want and
what they should have is
ballot reform. They are united l
on this question and the politician b
who stands in the:r way will. hear f
from them. a
Murder Near Carentro. h
Special to The Times-Democrat. ii
Carencro, June 3.-A man named John
Pope was waylaid and killed at a point
north and near Carencro at 1:3o o'clock i
this morning. The man killed was generally i
considered guilty of the recent attempted
assassination of one of the leading farmers, l:
and it is believed by most of our people
that this fact had something to do with the
killing. He was afforded every opportunity o
and ample time to leave the country, but
seemed to have no fear, knowing there was
no positive proof against him. The occur- a
rence is universally regretted, but many
consider it a just retribution. The coroner's
jury is rendered a verdict as usual in such u
cases. The murdered man was fairly rid
diled with bullets. a
The Gazette hopes that this mys- o
terious assassination will be ferreted g
out and the assassins brought to p
justice. It was a most foul murder C
and the good name of our parish sl
demands that it should not go un- d
punished. This man was waylaid II
and killed in the night without being t<
given any chance for his life' It is p
certainly regrettable that the slayers c.
of Pope selected such a peaceful h
and law abiding place as Carencro w
to do their criminal work. The a
people of the community are natur- s,
ally outraged at the atrocity and tl
unparalleled fiendishness of the d
crime. If there is any way to find
out the guilty parties, it should be t
done. b
A .OUITJERN EXPERI. o

Atlanta Constitution. d
A Memphis paper calls attention I
to a successful farming experiment '
near Sycamore, Ala.
It seems that two brothers are
operating on a five-thousand-acre t
tract of land. They employ eightyt
four whites and not a single negro.
They raise all the food crops neces- h
sary for the people and the stocks
n their little community, and all
the meat they need, but cotton is t
their principal crop. But they do
not ship their cotton to northern h
markets to be worked up in eastern
mills. A mill on the plantation t
manufactures the cotton into yarns h
and another mill grinds the seed P
into oil. The yarn mill cost $ss3,
o.- and pays a handsome profit.
The success of this experiment o
should eonvince northern tarme's
who are seeking southern homes
that they can come down here asd
gt along prosperously with white
tahro aIne, if they prefer it.

The signs, "For Sale" and rTo Let
for the Season," show up with un- I
usual frequency in front of large
estates that have, in the past, always "
been used by their owners and that
heretofore could not be leased nor t
bought. A good many of our busi
ness men, in using the pruning
knife on expenses, are cutting oE
the luxury of a summer home and
are planning either to spend the hot
season in the city ox to take their
outing in a modest soft of way.
All this sort of thing is bound to be
felt by the transportation copapanies,
the big hotels and a ssaiall.army of
people who, in various ways, reap
reach harvest during the summer
from the city visitors. The hard
times are, indeed, teaching some
unpleasant lessons are enforcing
self-denial in a direction that is not
relished, But, while the unfortunate -
stay-at-homes this season try to im
agine that they are just as comforta
ble as they would be at the seashore
or within the reach of the cool
mountain breezes, they can, perhaps,
find a grain of consolation .in the
thought that the economies being
practised are providing the only
right road to a healthy restoration
of property.-Boston Traveller.
It is poor policy to run down
your town. If you see nothing
good in it to talk about, shut up.
If the town doesn't suit you go
somewhere else, nothing prevents
you from leaving. But bear in
mind that wherever you may go,
you will find some good and some
mean people, for every town has
its virtues and faults.
INJfIUAANITY OF A SOUTI
ERN PA CIF C RAILROAD
COND UCTOR.
New Iberia Enterprise.
It has been reported that Charley
Bryant, whose mind of late has
become unbalanced, was thrown
from a freight train and had his back
and head broken. The facts as we
have learned, are as follows: Charley
it seems has the hobby that he can
travel and buy everything he wants I
without money-all that he has to
do is to command. He left the city, d
last Friday, on a passenger train of -
the Southern Pacific with the idea
of going to Laredo to see his brother
Paul, and also, as he claimed, as of
agent of a Sewing Machine Co. th
Wh len the train was about two hours
under way, the passengers noticed p'
a slight commotion and slowing up
of the 'train (it did not stop alto- th
gether) and in looking out were sur
prised to see the conductor putting
Charley off the train, in an isolated
spot, in the swamp, just when the si
day was going into night. A New
Iberia passenger asked the conduc
tor why he put the man off; he sim
ply answered: "Because he is
crazy." The poor boy, finding th
himself alone in a desolated spot, E
with nothing but the blood-sucking
mosquitoes of the Louisiana .a
swamps to keep him company while b
they stung him and hummed their de
doleful song in unison with the muf- am
fled voices of the frog and alligator
to cheer up his demented condition,
bethought himself to try and get out
of such a dilemna and catch on the
first train, which we un
derstand, was a west bound freight.
In doing so, he was violently thrown
backwards in a lot of rubbish on the
way side, bruising him up considera
bly. There was a humane main
though, on that train, who had the
train stopped and looked after the
man that was hurt. Thinking that
he was not seriously injured, and bi
seeing that he could do no good, he
notified the east bound treight to to
take him to the city and have him (
cared for, designing the place where m
he was thrown from the train.,
This was done and Charley was re- E
turned to the c€ty and afterwards to
his home. His father writes: "My
poor boy is now in the Louisiana
Retreat, since Sunday; whether heal
will ever regain his right mind time
only will telL The doctor whe ex
amined him thinks it is a " "very
serious case, but there is some little
hope." . . p
