t Crops.
It is safe to say that there will not be r
'tllicient corn raised in thi4 parish thisi
season for horne cunsntiltion.
Light showers tfell in ditlerent plr.
tions of the parish last Monday, but not t
in entltcient quantity, however, to e of a
any ,benefit to the crops. I
Our farnle.sl shoulid haIe their Paris ,*
Green r'ady, and keep their eyes peeled I
oni that pestiferous varmint commonly r
':tlled the "caterpillar." as they have al- ,
ready made their appearance in the low- e
er part of the State.
From our exchanges we learn that r
calterpillars have already made their ap. c
petaranee in Alabama, Texas and somee
portions of this State. We advise our
falrmers to go slow in buying goods on
the strength of a cotton crop. ti
We are pleased to bear that work is
going on well on the farms, and that the
eolored lahorers have settled down to h
active and honest exertions to make a 0
crop and put some money in tlheir pock
ets, in which we cordially wish them
great tSecess.
Delinquent Taxes. t Ih
The- Convention has adopted articles .,.
10 and I', relitive to delittllnent tax- hi
ptal'rs. Article 9 gives the tax collector
the right to sell without suit property for
non-payment of taxes, which may, how_
ever le redeeemed by paying 29 per cent Ii
in addition to price and costs, within one fli
year. All deed given hy tax eollec*ors ji
are to be recognized by courts as prima ot
fa,.ie evidence of the State. Article 10 ki
prohibits the legislature from passing at
any law which would p ietpone the pay- of
ment of taxes, except in cases of a de- as
struction of crops or other public calami- as

it. The people are well pleased with the

Mr. Ed. Burk, whq we are sorry to

One of the oldest steamboat clerks lit
ing in this city, he has proven himself
hollest to a fault and conscientious to a
I'serapule; true as steel, alwyays on hand,
morning, noon or night, he has bad bunt
one interest, that of his employer. May
hle live for many years, and naiy he al
wa's lihe a- rich, in that which men
llshollnl prize the most, the good will of
his fellow-men.
The Dreonth.
The long con'tinned drougth ef more
than six weeks has completely ruined
the corn crop of this section, and in
jnred the cotton materially. It becomes
,our farmers to secure, if possible, some
kind of forage to replace their lost corn,
and we would suggest a general planting
of peas, and the saving of as much hay
as can be cut. By this means a goodly
amount of provender for stock will be
supplied, whicb will save the outla~r of
money next year for corn.
Gettitg Even.
On our first page we publish an arti
cle headed "A High Old Time," which
shows to the reader that the opportuni.
ty for Kansas to get even with St. Louis
has come, and she has not been slow to
improve it. For some time past St.
Louis has been shipping all of her exo.
dlus darkies to Kansas City, and that
town protesting loudly, could not, help
herself. The railroad war and the con.
sequent cutting down of rates in favor
of east bound passengers, however, has
been taken advantage of by Kansas
City to ship all of her negro emigrants
to it. Louis. The fare is only fifty cents,
and, st that rate Kansas City has been
able to increase the negro population of
st. Lmis very considerable. The chane
es are that the St. Louis authorities will
do some tall swearing.
Lawyer Gallaghar, of San Francisco,
was desperately in love with Mabel Cur
ran,, but she cared very little for him.
He weint to her house when she was ill,
firced his way to her bedside, and asked
her if she would marry him. She re
piled that she certainly would not.
"Then," he said, as he drew a revolver, a
"you shall be united to me in death,"
:jiid he tired two shots-one at her and
o oe at himself. Up to this point the
affnir was dramitic, and Gallagher no
doubt imntended a real tragpdy, .but his
aim was bad. Mabel escaped the ballet
by rolling over quickly, and it siaply
nmade a hole in her night-dress, while
the wound that he inflicted on himself
puenetrated only to the breastbone.
