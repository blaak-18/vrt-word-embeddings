SABBATH MUSINGS.
BY W. C. J.
RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO )RS M. E. H1
Were this world all, were eartd time all
of life,
It were not worth the toil of life tolive,
Litie's purest joys would not repay for
woes,
'lnthat mark the current of our destiny.
It's every s~ene of bliss, of woe, of chbange
Sweep by, cre we can claim them as our
And leave us to fancy their realities,
In the dim, dark visions ofremembrance
Asi.de from life to come, all human life
Is a contilnuosn tale of human sorrow.
lHe irts, Withount number, have throbbed
and thrilled with hopes,
Lov.aly as the rich colourings of the how
That spans the c!o'd, yet like those col
ourii:ns.
Doomed to fadle in the dark mists that
made them.
We only live to die. How shall we live,
That we may die aright ? To meet that
ctldless life,
Which never dies, or that wlhich ever
dies?
There is an endless life-au endless-leath,
Dying, yet living ever, living and ever
dying,
Away froll God; from Heaven and all
the good,
Away fromnt light, from hope, from happi
ness."
The present's but a point oftinme, and fled
Ere we can realize it's being-fled
To bear its record to Eternity.
'Tis thenu a fuearful thing, to be, to live,
If life survive the tomb-more fearful
still,
If, like tile frail casket it inhabits
It vanishes away, to be no more.
'ris only in the future that we live,
To this we ever look, on this we hope,
And as it comes, it comes a mere index
To a future still, a future ever;
'Till the great future of the great here
after,
Bursts on the souls immortal vision.
And will this dust, this frail, and dying
dlust
Be called to life again, when it has passed
The confines of the tomb? Will it be
clothed
In ho gs.and garb of immortality?
It will. So says tti, ip.atrea worn ur mme
Who wore the robe of flesh in human
form,
Whose death upon the cross, the ransom
paid,
And rising from the tomb proclaimed to
all,
Beyond the tmmb there is a resurrection i
Nature herself, is but a ceaseless roll
Of ceaseless change, and in her vast do
main
All things are common, and no use is base;
The tropic flower, which in the torrid zone,
UTnfolds its blushings and inhales its
sweets,
Anon may freeze amidst the Arctic enoc a
Or glisten in the dow-drop. It may float
Upon the ocean wave, or feed the fires
That flash Iland burn amid the clouds. Its
destiny
Like ours is still to be, in varied forms,
And Life and Desth, thro'out all nature's
range,
Are itntricate companions with each other.
Strange; strange to say, 'Tis death and
death alone,
That makes life possible. 'Tis life alone
That makes death certain. Natnre thro'
out
Declares the truth revealed, that God,
thro' all
In all, and over all, reigneth Omnipotent.
From Earth to Star, 'tis all Theology.
And every atom in the boundless vast,
Is a great volume of the Eternal truth
That all is plann'd-designed-and oper
ates
To one grand end, by Him, whose wisdom
sees
The present thro' no medium-the future
Without foresight, the past, without re
membrance.
To whom, all space is but a point,
All truths one idea, and all time one mo
ment.
There is in every human heart a hope,
That bounds froml earth to Heaven; yes
the skeptic
Sighs for higher life, for joys beyond the
grave,
But clouds, dark, dreary, fbarful, sweep
athwart
His trembling hopes, that shudder at
eternity.
Not so the christian's hope..-bis an un
clouded sky,
Alike to him the storms and calms of life,
He sees parental love in each vicisitude,
He reads bright truth on the starry page.
He hears sweet music from the livint
voices
Qf rolling sphere., swept by the hand
Of vast Omnipotence.
Faith with a heavenward eye, looks foz
her home
Beyond the stars. Washed in the clean
sing stream,
Chat flowed from Calvary, she claim
heirship
To immortal life, tojoys ineffable.
She knows that tho' this mortal, shal.
decay
An angels eye shall guard the slumber
ing dous,
12ill God shall bid it rise, and be immor
tiii
She looks to that bright home above the
skies,
Where the bless'd soals, whom desti
alone could sever,
ablu meet again to live ead 1ove for
