t composition and its basic philosophica
t and intellectual ideas-as "masculine to
an astonishing degree." From the in
tellectual standpoint praiseworthy
therefore they must be "masculine'
which leads one to observe once more
that there is nothing small about the
male mind when it comes to claiming
things.
Miss Smyth is English born and rear
ed, the daughter of a British artillery
general. The military social set into
which she was born is one of the most
conventional amonig all mankind in its
notion of what is proper for a well
born and bred "young female." So i
Ethel Smyth found it when, aspiring
and longing, feeling within her a grow
ing impulse of power which she must
express or die, she at the age of twelve 1
announced to her family that she was
going to Leipsic to study music.
The little girl's family checked her, 1
meddled with her natural longings and
sought to kill them. Her work, ad- ]
mirable as it is, shows traces of
Grundyish interference. It is colorless
in the passages where it should be
warm and passionate, the critics say.
as though the young woman could not
burst her stays and be entirely natural
and full in her expression of what
Mrs. General Grundy disapproved.
Still the young lady's opera is so strong
and musical in other ways that the
critics may forgive this defect. She
will probably learn better in time.
Ethel Smyth was persistent She
kept declaring over and over again
that she intended to study music and
compose music as well. It required
seven years to overcome the family.
Then the girl went her way to Leipsic
rejoicing. The seven years. however,
were not wholly lost, for she developed
a fine, graceful physique through exer
cise in doors and out. She is fond of
golf, horseback riding and dancing.
The Smyth family gave her permis
sion to remain in Leipsic a year. By
that time they believed the nonsense
would be taken out of her and she
would be willing to return home and
take the round of life suitable to any
well regulated army -girl. But she did
not return at the end of a year. She
remained in Leipsic, on the contrary.
four years, studying with enthusiasm.
She began musical composition while
there. Leading performers in the city
of music gave at different times a
string quartet and a violin sonata by
her. After Leipsic the girl still re
fused to drop into nonentity, but con
tinued working in Dresden: Munich
and Florence for several seasons. Then
she studied in Rome, whither she still
journeys from time to time to breathe
in the thrilling atmosphere of art and
music in Italy.
It is interesting to note that it was a
man, and a musical authority at that,
too, one with a contempt for woman in
musical composition, who first suggest
ed to the girl to write an opera. He
was Herman Levi. During her years
of schooling Ethel Smyth had been
writing symphonies. sonatas, a mass
and chamber music with more or less
success. She herself plays her own
compositions with rare skill and pow
er. One day Herman Levi heard her
play and said to her:
"You must write an opera."
She has now written two. She her
self composes both music and words.
The first opera was "Fantasie:" the
second is "Der Wald," which was re
ceived with favor in Covent Garden,
London, before it was brought to Amer
ica. Its leading idea is from Schiller's
lines:
Art thou aftald of death? Dost desire to
live, forever?
;tre In the whole! When thou art gone.
It will endure.

that it amounts to a fad. The fad will

tic women are getting good money out
of the homemade rug business. There
are braided and sewed rugs, crocheted
rugs, knitted ones and those woven by
hand in a way similar to that whereby
the most expensive Persian and orien
tal rugs are manufactured. All over
the Union women are catering to the
popular fad. learning from aged moth
ers and grandmothers how these made
rugs half a century ago, except that
the grandmothers made the rugs for
sturdy farm boots to tread upon, and 1
that right heavily, while the grand
daughters make theirs for dainty la
dies to show off in parlors and even in
some cases to hang up for draperies.
The rug foundation can be painted or
stained with the outline of a colored
figure or scene and the rag or wool fill
ing be worked in to correspond. so that
the outer surface reresents a sort of
tapestry picture. To produce the thing
quite perfect all the dyes used must 1
also be the unfading homemade ones 1
used by the grandmothers. A young
lady in New York city is actually mak- t
ing a fortune from the manufacture (
and sale of these rugs. She occupies
all the floors of one house.

TREATMENT OF WALLS.
A Hint For the Woman Who Wishes
an Artistic Eifect.
If the walls arz: tastefully decorated.
a room is more than half furnished.
Wall papers are now produced in suc!
endless variety that something artisti,'
may easily be found for a very s:l::l i
amount.
Perhaps one of the most popular
methods of treating a wall consists iLt
papering it in two colors, or. rather.
Si fil
BLUE AND WHITE
two shades of the same color. the up
per section being lighter than the l)w
er. as a rule.
The diN iding line is conccealcd by a
shelf which runs around the room and
which holds china, books. lyric-a-brac.
etc.
The illustration shows just such a
treatment of a wall. The color sche,:nme
is in two shades of Ilue. harmonizing
prettily with the white woodwork and
the blue and white china.

EXTRAVAGANCE OF WOMEN
They Waste Many Little Things
Which Count Up.
Are women extravagant?
An English paper discusses this at
great length in its usually ponderoin
fashion.
I say they are and they are not.
In household and many important
matters the majority of women are not
extravagant; for, as a rule, they are
not well off ac
cording to their
position in life,
their allowances
are small and .
they have many
expenditures.
Then, too,
they have been
trained to know
the price of
things. and they
usually get their
money's worth.
Woman's meth

She will wear her best tailor made
out in the rain., thereby impairing its
freshness forever and a day, and this
simply to make an impression on some
woman she doesn't really care two cents
about. She will likewise hold up her
umbrella in a rainstorm using a hand
incased in a white glove. She might
at least remove the glove, for one spot
of water absolutely ruins it.
She will buy a dozen veils at one
time, wear each once or twice and then
throw it in a little heap in the bottom
of a drawer. If the veil had been roll
ed lengthwise, it would have lasted
four times as long, and why use so
many at once?
Then she will put rough bindings on
the bottom of her skirts and ruin her
expensive boots, or, worse still, put on
no binding at all, which ruins the skirt.
Yes, and she will waste money for
neck ribbons which are mussy and
don't look half as well or last as long
as a regular collar and buy fancy belts

up her money so wonderfully that she

For Half Mourning.
Half mourning is not now so rigidly
insisted upon, but white voile with
black silk mull trimmings or with chif
fon ruchings and other garniture are
allowable. When such a gown is to be
worn with a hat, the latter should be
trimmed with mauve tulle mingled
with white and with bunches of white
violets. Mauve is used now instead of
the unbecoming lavender. Few people
put their children into mourning now
except for the funeral and for church
for a few weeks, as it is thought too de
pressing for young minds.
