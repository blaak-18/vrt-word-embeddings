The Fire Cow's Owner.
It is reported from Chicago that
Mrs. Catherine ('Leary. owner of the
fractious cow which kicked over a
lamp in the rear if No. 13;7 )e Koven
street, ir. )ctober, 1M71. and started
a blaze which cost Chicago 31 H1.I, ,
(,,. died the other day of acute pncu
monia. A three-story brick structure
occupies the site where in 1I71 stood
the O'Leary cottage. Upon a large
stone in front of the house appear
these words: .-The great tire of 1871
originated here and extended to Lin
coln park." The story will be com
plete when it is known what became
of the cow that objected to being
milked by lamplight.
lncreastng IRtpitdly.
In 1890 there were nearly 4.000.010
women and girls among the class
called wage-earners in the United
ttates. 'Iheir number has increased
in ten years over 1,200,0J0., o~ more
than 41 per cent. In the various
branches of trade the increase in
female empioyes was 263 per cent.
'his is due to the rapid utilization of
women as accountants, cashiers,
clerks, stenographers, typewriters,
and the like. Durine thesame period
the number engaged in the profess
lone show a great increase, in many
instances the percentage of increase
being far larger for women than for
men.

A Long Jump.
Nearly everyone who looks out of
the window of the Washington monu
ment wants to know if anyone evern
committed suicide by jumping off.
Nobody ever did and as far as can be
ascertaine4 nobody ever wanted to.
The only thing that ever did jump off
the monument was a cat. It seems
that when the monument was being,
built a cat climbed the scaffold and
when it had reached 500 feet decided
it was high enough and jumped off.
According to the legend the cat
reached the ground unhurt and was
settling its fur when a wandering dog
killed It.

DOUOIN( WATERSPOUTS.
OUvely Times for a Steamship and a
Flock of Mother Carey's ChbLeas.
A waterspout struck the British
steamship Ferndene south of Cape Hat
teras on May 25th, and the deluge of
water which was poured on her decks
nearly made a clean sweep of every
thing movable. The Ferndene ar
rived here yesterday with a cargo of
sugar from Cardenas and Maltanzas,
and Capt. Millburn told the story of
her rough usage by the spout. On
the afternoon of May 25th. when the
Ferndene was to the southward of
:'ape Hatteras, numerous waterspouts
were sighted, traveling rapidly in dif
ferent directions, and the course of the
vessel had to be changed frequently
in order to keel) out. of their way.
Sihifting winds and numerous sudden
squalls added to the difficulty of avoid
ing the waterspouts, and the steamer
had had several narrow escapes before
finally she was struck. About 5
a'clock, just as Capt. Millburn came on
(ldeck, he saw that one of the water
spouts was rapidly whirling toward
the Ferndene. and it was impossible to
avoid a collision, so the captain shout
ed to all hands to drop flat on the
deck in order to escape being swept
overboard. With a rush and a roar
the great column of whirling water
struck the vessel and broke, tons of
water deluging her decks. The boats
wain of the vessel, who had not heard
the command of his captain, was
hurled from the bridge and dash,ed
against the wheelhouse, and seriously
injured. He was carried to the cabin
by his shipmates and his injuries were
found to be of a most serious charac
ter. Several others were badly bruised
and had bones broken. Peculiar at
mospheric conditions were noticed be
fore and after the vessel was struck.
There was a strong smell of gas, as if
submarine disturbances had something
to do with the appearance of the water
spouts. No rain had fallen for two
days, but soon after the spout disap
peared the rain began to fall in tort
rents from an apparently cloudless
sky. Capt. Millburn said that twen
ty or thirty "Mother Carey's chickens"
had been following the steamer for sev
eral days and they were seen flying
astern just before the vessel was
struck. Evidently some of them were
caught by the waterspout, for when the
deluge subsidedy there were many
feathers on the decks and the birds
had disappeared from sight.-Philadel

TED THROUGH HIS SIDE.
A St. Louis Man Has an Artificial Mouth
Into His Stomach.
There is one man in St. Louis who is
unable to take nourishment in the or
itnary way, and is fed through a hole
in his side The patient is William
Kaselow, seventy years of age, who
was operated upon at his home, corner
,f Manohester road and Grand avenue,
last Saturday, says the Chronicle.
Kaselow has an aneurism of the aorta.
For six months he has been sustained
entirely upon liquid food. Lately his
condition grew very serious, and for a
.eriod of five days preceding the opera
tion it was impossible for him to take
#my nourishment whatever. Dr. Joseph
L. Bauer, assisted by Drs. Louis Bauer,
W. V. Kingsburg and J. D. Nifong,
operated upon him. It was impossible
for the surgeons to diagnose the case,
but the supposition was that a cancer
o'as growth had formed in the stomach.
Repeated attempts had been made to
open the esophagus, but without suc
cess. After an entrance had been made
into the stomach a large tumor of the
acrta, just above the esophagus, was
found. It was so situated as to pre
vent food from passing. It was Im
possible, however, to remove the tumor,
as that would have resulted in the
eatient's death. The problem which
the surgeons had to solve was how to
nourish the patient. An artifcial
mouth was made, and through this he
will be fed. Last night for the first
time since the operation he was sup
slled with nourishment. His diet here
after will be wholly liquid, as anything
requiring mastication could not be
digested. Dr. Joseph L. Bauer, in
speaking of the case yesterday, said
that Kaselow could probably be ke.pt
alive for years.
Cheras Grls ase a se rprise.
This year the members of the sopho
more elas of Rutgers College resolved
to vary the mual monotony of the cre
mation celebration. The effect of the
starttling ilnnovation introduced by the
bold students upon the crowd that
thronged the elrcus grounds to witness
the rlteas attending the annihilation of
"Analytlas" was more than startling.
Beretofore it has been the custom for
the college men to show. their agility
ii celebhrating their release from the
thraldom of old "Analyties" by par
tcipating la a ballt dance as a part
of the ceremonmtal. The committee
sonaidered this too tame, snd promised
a surprise. At the time for the ap
erMace of the ballet a scre of bright
ooryphees from New York pironetted
in the foreground. The latest novel
ties in high kicking and acrobatles
were given in bewildering succession.
It was a revelation to the staid de
sacendants of the Dutch. Many of
them were shocked by the aetions ofI
the dancers, and the wily collegians
ire being eamured tfr their audacity.

(From the Troy, N. Y., Times.)
R. W. Edwards, of Lansingburgh, was
lrostrated iby sunstroke during the war
tllud it has entailed on him peculiar and
serious consequences. At present writing
Mr. E. is a prominent officer of I'ost Lyon.
(. A. It.., ('oboes, and a past aid-de-camp
on the staff of the coummander-in-chlef of
Allany Co. In an interview with a re
lorter, be said:
"I was woundeI and sent to the hospital
at Winche-ter. 'l hey sent me together
with others to \Vashington-a ride of
about 100 miles. Having no room in the
lox cars we were placed face up on the
bottom of flat cars. The sun beat down
upon our unprotected heads. When I
reached Washington I was insensible and
was unconscious for ten days while in the
hospital. An albscess gathered in my ear
and broke; it has been gathering and
breaking ever since. The result of this 100
mlle ride and sunstroke, was, heart dis
ease, nervous prostration, insomnia and
rheumatism; a completely shattered sys
tem which gave me no rest night or day.
As a last resort 1 took some Pink Pills and
they helped me to a wonderful degree. My
rheumatism is gone, my heart failure,
dyspepsia, and constipation are about
gone and the abscess in my ear has
stoppet discharging and my head feels
as clear as a bell when before it felt as
though it would burst and my once shat
teretl nervous system is now nearly sound.
Look at those fingers," Mr. Edwards said,
-do they look as if there was any rhenma
tism there ' He moved his fingers rapidly
anti freely and strode about the room like a
vouting boy. "A year ago those fingers
were gnarled at the joints and so stiff that
1 could not hold a pen. My knees would
swell up and I could not straighten my leg
out. My joints would squeakwhenlmoved.
"I cannot Iegin to tell you," said Mr.
Edwartls. as he drew a long breath, "what
my feelings is at present. I think if you
lifted ten years right off my life and left
me prime and vigorous at forty-seven I
could feel no better. I was an old man
and could only drag myself painfully about
the house. Now I can walk off without any
trouble. That in itself," continued Mr.
Edwards, "would be sufficient to give me
cause for rejoicing, but when you come to
consider that I am no long what you might
call nervous and that my heart is appar
ently nearly healthy and that I can sleep
nights you may realize why I may appear
to speak in extravagant praise of Pink
Pills. These pills quiet my nerves, take
that awful pressure from niy head and at
the same time enrich m) blood. There
seemed to be no circulation in my lower
limbs a year ago, my legs being cold and
clammy at times. Now the circulation
there is as full and as brisk as at any
other part of my body. I used to be so
light-headed and dizzy from my nervous
disorder that I freequently fell while cross
ing the floor of my house. Springis coming
and I never felt better in my life, and I am
loouing forward to a busy season of work."
Its Skes a Difference.
It is noticed that even a short resi
dence in the United States makes a
marked change in the conditions and
standards of the immigrant. Scandi
navian passengers sometimes revisit
their old homes after a sojourn in
this country. They usually take the
steerage passage on the eastward
voyage, but the second cabin on the
return westward voyage. The east
ward steerage passage they flo: clean
and comfortable, but the recollection
ol the ill-smelling steerage of their
first trip to America drives them to
the second oabin. These people as
cribe the difference between the east
ward and westward steerage passage
to the difference in the cleanliness of
the immigrants that have lived in the
U'nited States. It' is to be added,
however, that in days not long ago
the number of westward bound pas
sengers greatly exceeded the number
of eastward bound, and doubtless it
is the cleanliest and most intelligent
of original immigrants who are able
to revisit their old homes. The con
dition of human beings shipped like
cattle Is not the same as those who
travel for pleasure.
A Level Head.
General Booth, the Salvation Army
leader, in reviewing his work in this
country, has many kind words to say
concerning the newspapers. IHe did
not imagine the press could do much
goo, even if it wanted to, and cer
tainly he did believed that it wanted
to. The newspapers have changed
their opinion of Gen. Booth just as he
has changed his opion of the newopa
pers. The old idea that he was a
wild-eyed fanatic, whose sole object
was to gain notoriety, has been aban
doned, now that the American people
have become more familiar with Gen.
Pooth's methods and objects, and
what he thinks of America is best
shown by his act in applying for nat
uralization as a citizen of the United
States.
The O.ly Serviaor.
In 1856 a band of Sioux Indians
raided a little colony of settlers who
had built cabins on the shore of Lake
Okoboji, in Iowa ' They massacred
all of the unfortunates except three
young girls, one of whom. Miss Abbie

There are sixty-two trades unions
in San Francisco. and, according to
the local papers, not one accepted the
invitation of the executive committee
to parade on the national holiday.
Several of the unions formally
voted not to do so. The reasons given
for this attitude are peculiar. The
secretary of the Cost Seamen's union
said that -"many in his union are need
ir, clothes and do not care to parade
their poverty."' The president of the
Paker s union ob~ecteato parading be.
cause he stated that the executive
committee had given out the contract
for music to the lowest bidder. The
president of the Iron Molder's union
said that his union would not parade
because --the people of the head of
the celebration are not in sympathy
with the iron molders." The presi
dent of the Carpenters and Joiners'
union told a reporter that -.the capi
thlists who were heading the celebra
tion were very willing to let them
march with them one day in the year
and be hostile to them the other three
hundred and sixty-four days."
Knew Her i stlness.
It is reported that Kanidia, a Kick
apoo squaw, took a shotgun and held
up the contractors of the Choctaw
railway. in Oklahoma, and all his
men, and would not let them build a
foot of track in her allotment until a
bond of $2U01) was put up as a guar
antee for damages. The company re
fused a day or two ago to arbitrate
with her, and when the men arrived
on the ground she met them with her
shotgun with the above result. Lo!

bought off with a jug of whisky; not
so the red sister, who knows the ways

A novel cause for seeking a divorce
is given by Mrs. E. 1'. Jennings of
C'hicago. She is a slight, mitld!,
aged woman, who declares she is
worn out Ly her husband's abnormal
lisposition to move rather than pay
rent. For the twenty-fifth time in a
brief period,. it is chargel, Mr. Jen
nings came home and repeated his
Sld remark: -.Well. May, the mov
ing van will be here ti,-morrow at 7
a. m. I think you had better pack
up." Mrs. Jenning, says she has
worn herself out acting upon this re
mark of her husband, and she thinks
she should be given an opportunity
to live in one place long enough to
get acquainted with it. No doubt
her plea will be successful. It is
about time for Mr. Jlennings to move,
and the woman thinks she should be
excused from participating in the
next one.
A (Goo I Snake Lttory.
Some of the farmers in the Con.
necticut valley have been having an
exciting time in a big snake hunt.
The snake is a big python, which
escaped from Blarnum's show, and he
has been prowling aoujt among the
farms, eating the strawberries, drink
ing the milk, and even, according to
the report, trying to swallow the
cows. One strawberry raiser asserts
that the snake took at least 10)
pounds of his fruit, and another lost
nine gallons of milk at a single sess
ion, while other losses are reported.
A hunting party of farmers, armed
with clubs and pitchforks, pursued
the snake, but he took to the river
and calmly swam away.
