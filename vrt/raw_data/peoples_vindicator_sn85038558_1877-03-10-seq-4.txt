Don't Neglect the Stock.
Doring late fiall and early winter
f when stock received the most shab.
by treatment, a a rule, it is a great
asistake, and this is the very time, of
all others, when stock should have
the best treatment. It is the time in
whieh we are preparing them lor the
winter's siege, and how we start them
wil have very much to do with how
they wilt get thrlnlglh in our warm
gulf coast country this thing is sel
dom thought of. Here we hare no
winter, so to speak ;. still the same
rule holds good here. The right
kind of treatment at the opening of
the winter, such as it is, carries the
stock thbogh si much better condi
tion than would otherwise result.
The piney woods stock taiser has
so particular treatment of any kind.
He permits hi. stock to look out far
itself at all seasons ; but we are not
now talking about neglected piney
woods stock. Many are getting to
have better stock-stock that they
san asird to feed--and that is the
kind of stock we are treating upon
io tlhis artcleo It i i kind of steok
that demand. atntndnl, and attend
ig.to stoek is like everything else-
he proper attention mast come at
he Â·merps time to rhow the best o
salts.
The hardest time on stock is when
the frosts have killed the summer
vegetation. It brings about an en
tire change of everytling. The grass
.es, if they do not become scarce, lose LI
their nitritive properties, nil of a
sudden, thius presenting a feed for
which the animal organization is not
prepared. As a coisc'lljence tile ani
inll talls off with great rapidity,
wh'erea:s, if it were sustailned for a
few weeks with proper food, and
passed into the chantged condition of
altl'irs gradually, it would get along Pi
Inluc' better. A dollar's worth of riL
teed properly given at this particular 011
lleriill would do morell good tlhan five p
dollaais' worth of feed given later in
the season, prov'ided tlhe animal had uli
lleetn wholly neglected through the
dividinlg line between sauiituer and
\inter.

of
ty From the Sportsman.
a In some parts of Belgium attempts 5
have been made to extirpate the
ei moles from the soil. At one of the
most elegant chateaux in that courn
k' try, surrounded by a park adorned
of by nagniffcent lawns, men were em
sr- ployed to catch and kill the moles.
ed After a timhe they were killed off and
ia- disaprea red entirely, in consequence
all of which the velvety grass of the Y
ta- lawns soon withered. The cause of
'a- the mischief was a small white worm,
Ie which had been kept down by the
ut moles. These little aniimals, thiough
U(1 troublesome at times, are, as the
ice ibove incident proved, very useful on
an estate. Thie pIroprietor of tihe
r- chateau, after he hadr made the dis
covery, was obliged to stock iris place
" with a freshr supply of moles, after -
of which the lawns flourished as for
for lely.

ie For fle principles by which The World
to will he govelted in its discussion s1a
ts treatment of the public questions, it will
to s ice te say that The World, while con
a sernative in polities, desires the conssrt
tion only of what is good and wise in or
public institions and no limitations up)0
the right of plivate judgment and' tl
aspirations of Reform, save those whic'
are imposed by prudence decorum, sad
a rational respect for vested rights aml
for the honest opinions of all elassee pad
. sects of men, While it has labored' fo
the principles and hails the triumph of
the Democratic party as affording uas
practical promise of Reform in our publie
admimetrations, city, state and natiou4
it will not be blindly devoted to the
n vancement of any party or any cliqua
It. will freely canvass the public conduet,
while it will treat with respect the â¢
rate rights, of Public Men, and it will ex1
amine fearlessy into the workingsofoot

rpirit as well as the letter of our lawh,
and a sleepless vigilance in maintiimt
all the great safe tads of Civil5

u igate and not to aggravate the evils i"
separable from Party Government lai

to ill feeling among our fellow-citzens of at
creeds and colors, all sections and it
sects; and to advance both by it PN'
