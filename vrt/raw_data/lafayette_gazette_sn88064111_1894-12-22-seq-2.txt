his song to jump on the frames of ing

but when it comes to the defence of we
our newspapers he wields a very tren- to

his ear, as is shown by this excerpt: be
Why is it that the people of the be
south will not patronize a southern n1

had a. magazine which conparcd Vi
favorably with the best publications r
of the kind atthe north. Frequent- ful
ly the higC biced artists of the Cen- w
tury and Harper's were employed an
to illustrate its articles, while it car- he
ried contributions from such distin
guished writers as Joaquin Miller, ke
F. Hopkins Smith and, we believe, ge
James Lane Allen. Yet it failed wi
from sheer lack of readers. Its st
widest circulation was at the north,
where people appreciate good liter
ture, ind are not only willing, but
anxious to pay for. it. It failed
and yet we are always prating of "a
first-class southern magazine!" la

en It will be seen that there was an '
to increase of 7246 or neatly 7 per tl
air cent over the vote of 1892, rather ra
in- unusual in an off election as com- it
man pared with a presidential election, C
when there is usually a great de- h
Use cline. In nearly all the new States to
ing the vote was smaller this year than e
as two years ago. The result shows A
es how much interest was felt in the I
is- election in Louisiana. This is par- t
ticularly the case in the southern I
ase half of the State; indeed, the re- c
hear turns, if carefully examined, will r
ple show matters to be reserved in as
as a rather peculiar way this year as 1
reju- compared with 1892. The three
bles. southern districts have increased
theirvote 15,912, while the three
hing northern districts have fallen off
be- 8566. The centre of political ac-t
obe. tivity seems to have moved south.
The vote is a fair one for Louis
s of iana, larger than it has cast for many
one years in *'off" elections when there
ents were no candidates but for Con
sub- gress in the field, and fair as com
one pared with other States, the average
