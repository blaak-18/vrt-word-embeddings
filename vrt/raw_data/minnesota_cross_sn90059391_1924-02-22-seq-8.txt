HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF
IN THIRD PARTY MOVEMENT
Radical Senators From Northwestern States Are Exert
ing Large Influence on Actions of Congress Most of
Them Are off Republican Reservation.
Conventions Have Heen Scheduled for Next Summer to Adopt
Platforms and Nominate National Candidates— LaFollette's Name
Looms Large on Political Horizon.
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C- Feb. 13.—1 s this to be the year when
another big third party movement is to be started in this country,
is a question that is being heard discussed nowadays in the Na
tional Capital. So many radical senators have come to the senate
lately that the great northwest is beginning to feel its power in
this direction.
Senator La Follette. of Wisconsin,
has been in the senate a long time,
and he always has been an insur
gent, always off the Republican res
ervation. He thinks no more of at
tacking the Republican party than
he does the Democratic party, in fact,
most of his attacks have been made
on the party that claims to elect him
from time to time.
Senator Hiram Johnson, of Califor
nia, is another senator who strays
away from the Republican reserva
tion whenever he feels like it. He
too, does not hesitate to attack the
Republican party whenever he feels
in the mood to do it.
Then there Is Senator Brookhart,
of lowa, a newcomer, a radical of the
radicals. Senators Frazier and Ladd,
of North Dakota, line up with the
same bunch.
Off Party Reservations
Minnesota last year elected two
Farmer-Laborites and turned down
both of the old political parties. Sen
ators Magnus Johnson and Shipstead
nearly always line up with the Re
publican insurgents or the Democrats
to help defeat the Republicans.
Senator Borah, of Idaho, is off the
Republican reservation most of the
time. Senator Norris, of Nebraska,
is also most independent in his
thought and action. He fights the
administration in the senate about as
much as he fought Uncle Joe Cannon
in the house when the latter was
speaker. Senator Norris has been
joined by another independent man
in Senator Howell of the same state,
this year. However, the new senator
from Nebraska is showing more signs
of being regular than Senator Norris
has ever shown.
In the recent voting, Senator Cap-
Ssr, of Kansas, Senator Harreld. of
klmhoma, and Henator Norbeck. of
South Dakota, uem to have joined
the other insurgents.
It is noticeable that most of the
senators named belong to the agri
cultural farm bloc in the senate, and
It seems they are sticking close to
one another. And on the Democratic
side of the chamber we notice that
Senators Dill, of Washington, and
Wheeler, of Montana, are inclined to
belong to the same crowd and vote
with them on numerous occasions.
.May Hold Convention
Thus it is shown that about 15
senators are inclined in the same di
rection. There are enough of them

CORRECT FOR HEN AND YOUNG MEN-
on the Republican side of the cham
ber to make life miserable for the
majority party at this session of
congress.
All of this gives rise to the com
ments that are heard about the prob
able coming out of a third party
movement this year. Already one or
two such gatherings or third party
conventions have been scheduled for
meeting this coming summer to
adopt a national platform and nomi
nate candidates for a national ticket.
Just who will be picked to head such
a party or ticket is yet problemati
cal, but Senator La Follette’s pame
has been heard mentioned more than
that of any other, and it is well
known that he has had presidential
ambitions ever since he entered pub
lic life. It is well known that this
element in the two parties has been
busy trying to get Senator La Fol
lette to make the race as a third
party candidate, but up to this time
he has not given his consent, but
there are many persons in Washing
ton who profess to believe that he
will be the one chosen and that he
will give in and stand for nomina
tion and election.
A third party movement, with the
greater portion of such element com
ing from the Republican party, will
repeat the history that was made
back in Roosevelt and Taft campaign
days. That’s why the Democrats of
the country are taking on such cour
age after their disastrous defeat of
four years ago. They believe they
see a big fighting chance this year,
especially if they can succeed in get
ting a third party in the field, and
the political wind is blowing in that
direction just now.
Klanswomen Active
Throughout Kansas
TROY, KAN., Feb. 18.—The Wom
en of the Ku Klux Klan are rapidly
coming to the front in the northeast
section of the state. Wathena and
Elwood now have strong organiza
tions and are in the midst of cam
paigns to increase the membership
to still greater proportions. The or
ganization in St. Joseph has ambi
tions to become as great in its mem
bership as is the men’s order in that
«ity, and is working to that end.
Splendid educational work be being
conducted in this section of the
state.

SENATOR HEFLIN, ACCUSER OF TEXAS LAND
FRAUD AGENT, DENIES KLAN MEMBERSHIP
(Burriiu of Publication and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 15. Sen
ator Heflin, of Alabama, denies that
he is a member of the Yu Glux Blan,
or that he ever was a member; and
he also dnies that he is directing or
leading in the management of Sena
tor Mayfield’s contest for his seat in
the senate. He charges that R. B.
Creager, of Texas, hos injected the
Ku Klux Klan into the situation in
order to hide his own land frauds
which the senate is about to investi
gate. In a speech in the senate on
this phase of the matter eSnator
Heflin said:
“I am not a member of the Ku
Klux Klan, I have never been a
member of the Ku Klux Klan. I
have never met with or had confer
ences with the attorneys for Sena
tor Mayfield in the contest pending
against him. I arti not directing or
managing his congest. I have not
heard a senator mention that con
test in two months.
“I will say in this connectioa that
long before the Ku Klux Klan was
heard of in Texas I made a speech at
Austin, invited there by the legisla
ture of the state to speak on the
cotton question. One night while I
was there I delivered a speech to the
dear old ladies of the Confederate
Home and the present distinguished
junior senator from Texas introduc
ed me. and I was a guest at his home
Presbyterians Are
Urged to Sacrifice
In a last desperate effort to ward
off the deficit which threatens to cur
tail for next year the benevolences,
including missions, of the Presbyteri
an church, as those of other denomi
nations have been, or probably will
be. curtailed. Presbvterion mission
aries in 15 countries have volunteered
to have their own salaries /educed.
In this country, a great effort —pos-
sibly the last of any size, as the fiscal
year ends March 31 will be under
taken during the week of Feb. 17-24.
including both Sundays. This will be
observed by the 10,000 Presbyterian
churches in the United States as a
sacrificial Loyalty Week, designated
by the Moderator, Rev. Charles F.
Wishart, and his associates on the
General Council. The 10,000 Presby
terian pastors will tell their 1,800,-
000 communicant members that, un
less Presbyterians respond with in
creased contributions to this call not
more than $9,000,000 to $10,000,000 of
the requisite $15.000 000 will be raised,
and drastic reductions in the world
wide work of the church will be nec
essary.
Among other things which Presby
terians will be urged to go without
for the sake of their contributions
will be amusements, luxuries- and
even necessities, so far as possible.
They wil be asked to give up a stock,
a bond, a piece of jewelry, some arti
cle of personal property, a ticket to
a concert, or a few gallons of gasoline
for an unnecessary pleasure trip, and
to add to their gifts to the church as
liberally as possible, doubling their
portions in every practicable in
stance. They will be reminded that
during war time they gave up meat
wheat, sweets, money, time and con
venience. They are now asked to
make as liberal sacrifices in behalf
of the program of the church for the
Christianizing of the world. Moder
ator WiShart in his official call states
that America is trembling between
paganism and Christianity; that from
Alaska to Porto Rico, the Presbyte
rian Board of National Missions is
grappling with the powers of dark
ness, and that the future destiny of
America is at stake; that in the Far
East a terrible race is on between
chaos and Christianity, and that un
less Christianity wins chaos will come
agaih.
Two of the largest Klan demons
trations to be held in the state of
Pennsylvania are scheduled within
three days of each other within the
next two weeks. The first is to be
held at Coraopolis, Saturday night,
February 23, and will consist of a
huge parade, demonstration and ini
tiation. Monday following, February
25, the Klansmen will assemble at
New Castle, where a repetition of
Saturday’s activity will mark the be
ginning of a long list of activity on
the part of Klansmen In Pennsyl

was installed at the instagation of
Dr. Walter K. Foley, chief of the hos
pital. This physician believes that
one of the greatest factors in health
is a right state of mind, and conse
for dinner. On that occasion I learn
ed to know him fairly well, and his
charming wife and fine boys. That
was in 1917, five yeears before he
became a candidate for the senate;
and I remarked at that time that
this man would go to the senate some
day. He had been railroad commis
sioner of the state for 10 years, and
a distinguished Texas Democrat,
now a member of the Austin commis
sion, said to me: ‘He will go to the
senate whenever he runs. He is one
of the most popular and able young
Democrats in the state.' My personal
friendship for him and hos family
dates back to 1917. I am also a
friend of the senior senator from
Texas (Morris Sheppard) and his
splendid family.
“I repeat, I am not a member of
the Ku Klux Klan. I have not been
a member of the Ku Klux Klan. I
have not met with the lawyers re
presenting eSnator Mayfield in his
contest; neither am I directing or
leading in the management of that
contest. These statetments refute
and show to be false the statements
made by this man R. B. Creager, who
is seeking to inject something into
the situation behind which he can
hide.”
Guess that will hold Mr. Creager
for awhile. He wil now be obliged
to cook up another excuse if he
wants to throw the blame on the
Klan. _____

Thought He Saw a Robed
(From Afton Star-Enterprise)
Last Sunday evening H. T.
(Heine) Schoon had a rather un
usual experience over near Thayer.
It will be remembered that the
evening Ivas dark and gloomy, with
a slight rainfall. Heine had been
over to Des Moines and was on his
way home and when he reached
the Cook hill south of Thayer he
saw something which startled him
for a second. Something white in
human form was standing in the
road with a light in its hand, wav
ing it back and forth as if to stop
him. At first he thought it was
an optical illusion, caused by an
off brand of refreshments, but. as
hp drew nearer he saw that it was
a real person. His imagination
was running wild, and he thought
Eerhaps it was a member of the
Klux Klan, or perhaps someone
wanting to rent him the civic
league room. But with a clear
conscience and an empty flask, he
applied the brakes, and it proved
to be a fellow creature in distress.
The station agent from Cromwell
had got into the ditch and needed
assistance. A daughter was in
jured, so Heine went to Thayer
and secured assistance.
PEOPLE OF TERRE HAUTE, IND., HAVE BEEN
BLUFFED ONCE TOO OFTEN BY MAYOR DAVIS
TERRE HAUTE, IND., Feb. 20
An attempt to slug the Rev. Mr. Mc-
Brayer, of the Liberty Avenue M. E.
church, Terre Haute, recently, is re
garded as a direct result of the at
tack on the minister by Mayor Ora
Davis, in which Mayor Davis called
the minister a ‘‘common dirty liar.”
The minister had called attention
from his pulpit to the immoral con
dition of Terre Haute, and had asser
ted' that the mayor apparently had
made no attempt to close bootleg
joints.
Terre Haute has been overrun with
every class of criminals. Citizens and
policemen have been murdered on
the streets by holdup men, and 17
gasoline filling stations have been
robbed in a comparatively short
time. Few. if any of the criminals
have been caught. Davis has an
nounced his candidacy for the nomi
nation for governor on the Republi
can ticket, and his platform in

WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 15-
Just to show to what extremes the
alien element in this country will go
to thwart the proposed immigration
bill now pending in Congress, it is
only necessary to state thai delegates
from 23 stattes met in Washington
yesterday to attend the meeting of
the Utalian-American Republican
National League The first thing they
did was to pass t resolution endors
ing President Coolidge for nomina

adopted a resolution asserting that
the Johnson immigration bill was un
just and un-American as well as dis
criminating against races
The Washington papers today play
up the endorsement and then show
the Italian League in turn demands
the defeat of the immigration bill.
The League also went on record as
favoring a modification of the Vol

The eLague called on President
Collidge at the White House today,
and its sessions will close with a din

been invited to speak.

against the bill, were paarticipants

ACTION STARTED
TO INVESTIGATE
CREAGER FRAUDS
Senator Heflin Gets Results
From Disclosures on
Floor of Senate
TEXAN IS IN HIDING?
Attorney Janies R. Page, of Kan
sas City, Mo., Knows Rio
iiramle Situation
(Bureau of Publlrntlon and (education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 15-
Senator Heflin, of Alabama, has fin
ally gotten action on his resolution
to have an investigation into charges
of fraudulent land operations in
Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. The
senate has ordered the investigation
made and the inquiry is to be con
ducted by the committee on postof
fice and post roads.
While this investigation will take
in the operations of all land com
panies in that section of the country,
it will especially investigate the
operations of the Alamo Land & Su
gar Company, of which R. B. Creger,
Republican national committeeman
from Texas, is president. Creager is
the same man who proposes to put a
crimp in the Ku Klux Klan by having
the Democratic party and the Repu
blican party insert planks in their
respective platforms in national con
ventions this coming summer hostile
to the Klan.
To Stop Complaints
Senator Heflin said in a senate
speech yesterday that he had inform
ation that Creager had at one time
secured an injunction from a state
court to prevent people defrauded
from writing their complaints to
government officials and send their
tales of woe through the United
States mails. That showed Creager’s
pull with both the postoffice depart
ment and the state courts.
Senator Heflin also charged that
Creager had come to Washington and
was in bidding somewhere directing
a campaign of abuse and slander by
mail to the various senators, trying
to stop the proposed investigation.
According to Senator Heflin, his
source of information comes from
one James R. Page, attorney, of Kan
sas City, Mo., who is the man who
has been through some of the pre
liminary work in the Rio Grande val
ley. He says Page is the man who
forced through the indictment of
W. E. Stewart, for whom this man
Creager is now receiver. Stewart was
the head of the Stewart Land Com
pany and he was indicted on 16
counts which carried a penalty of
SO years in the pen. Senator Heflin
said that Page was not a member of
the Ku Klux Klan as had been charg
ed but that Page had even made
■speeches against the Klan in Mis
souri in 1922.
Reads Extracts
Senator Heflin read into the Re
cord extracts from Collier’s Weekly,
'he Country Gentleman. Kansas City
Journal and others to show of the
•rickery and fraud perpetrated on
he people in the Rio Grande Valley
by the various land companies in
that section. Mr. Creager seems to
be connected with most of them as
an attorney in addition to being pre
sident of one of them which some
people proclaim is the worst one ot
the whole bunch.
Senator Heflin introduced into the
Record yesterday the following let

Quiet Reigns in Nation’s
Capital During Week
WASHINGTON, I). C„ Feh. 16.
Things are about as quiet In the
senate this week as they were
noisy last week. Senators are
getting their breath, apparently,
as last week they talked them
selves hoarse on the oil scandal
and trying to bring about the en
forced resignation of Secretary
I)enby. President Coolldge's
speech In New York on Lincoln’s
birthday anniversary seemed to
take all the sap out of those sen
ators who fought the administra
tion last week, and now they are
watching the reaction. They have
their ears to the ground to hear
what the people have to say.
HELP LIFT CHURCH DEBT
BURLINGTON, KAN., Feb. 18.—
While the board of stewards of a lo
cal church were sitting around the
table trying to devise plans for lift
ing the church debt, seven men in
the regalia of the Ku Klux Klan ap
peared, and after a short prayer at
the altar, presented the board mem
bers with an envelope containing
$26.50. Then they retired as silent
ly as they had come.
$9,000. I am a widow with two girls
to educate. I am now employed by
the above hotel at $12.50 a week as
maid, and I can hardly get by on
“Very respectfully,
“Mrs. Mary Hoffman.’’
Federal Official Perhaps?
“Mr. President, I have one letter
that suggests that one federal offi
cial. high in authority, may receive
commissions from these land sales.
The hearings will disclose whether
that is true or not,” said Senator
Heflin. “There are hundreds of people
stranded in the valley, duped by
these land companies, and defrauded
out of all that they possessed. I am
fighting for them. Let the truth be
known and let justice be done. That
is all I ask,” concluded the senator
from Alabama.
And the man most concerned is R.
B. Creager and he is the man who
wants the Klan abolished. Guess R.
B. will have troubles of his own be
fore he gets through with the senate
and the senator from Alabama. Why
does Creager want the kibosh put on
the Klan?
