-Though often lost the people's bat
tle is ever won. So long as unjust con
ditionscontit, e.so lohng will the people
protest against injustice. So long as
the few live without labor by the sweat
of the many. so long will the outraged
millions insist upin their rights. Men
and women are realizing as never be
fore what is hurting them, and they
will never rest until the causes of
their ills are removed.-Star and Kan

-Isn't it a somewhat remarkable
Circumstance, if the present adminis
tration is (efending the gamblers and
joint keepers, and if the republican
party and its candidates are the im
placable enemies of these outlaws that
they pretend to be. that every last
gambler and jointist should be oppos
ing the re-election of his friends and
putting campaign material into the
hands of his enemies in order to help
them succeed? Hlaven't the republican
managers got the plan of their cam
paign a little mixed?-Topeka (Kan.)

-Frank G. Darlington, superintend
ent of the Indianapolis division of the
Pennsylvania lines, was arrested re
eently on the dual charge of having
discharged William Carroll and Jacob
Walters, switchmen, for being mem
bers of the American Railway union
and with having prevented them from
securing employment on other lines by
blacklisting them. Superintendent
Darlington gave bond and was released
from jaiL Indictments have been re
turned by the grand jury under the
law of 1893, which provides' a heavy
penalty for the offenses upon convic
tion. including imprisonment in the
penitentiary.
-Out west, the people's party is
gathering all the laboring people into
Its folds. In the north, all the labor
anions are declaring for the people's
party. In the east, the new party is
being Indorsed by all kinds of labor
organizations; and down south, whole
states are being enrolled on our side.
The democratic party has been literal
ly wiped out of the political arena, by
the actions of Grover Cleveland and the
last congress, and the republican party
has nothing to offer for the betterment.
of the Industrial classes, hence the peo
ple's party Is the coming power, and
nothing will or can prevent its success.
