There will be a meetlng of the mem
bers of the Democratio Executive
Committee at the Ptlneaix loon to
day, and we trust ibere will be a full
attendance. The object of the meet
ing is all-important, if Natchitoches
designs doing her whole duty in the
approblaching ampaign. Our people
must not allow themselves to be de.
Sladed by the resection that Radical.
Ism is dead in Louisiana. It only
sleepeth, and adder-like, it would
I take but very little sunshine to warm
Sit nt life when the hydra.headed
: monster would prove asvenomous as
in former days.
While we have not the slightest
doubt of our State giving a large ma
jority for Gen. Hanoock, we are still
apprehensive of the tricks of the
wily Radial politlcians who are on
deavoring to slip Into Congress in
some of the Distriots. They can af
ford to spend freely of their ill-got
ton gals in order to secure the ob
ject of their ambition.
Who is it that is not aware that a
Chief Magistrate, however jut and
pure, is powerless for good with a
workIng majority In the House of

What student of history does not
Sremember the embarrassments whob
the immortal Washington had to
contend with during his second ad -
ministration Even In our own day, i
the history of Andrew Johnson's
short lcumbenoy of the Presidn
tial Chair will not be forgotten.
It behooves us, then, fellow-oiti
eas, to be up and doing. Let each
-one ao it that he has nothing to
reproach himself with after the
election. Let the rallying cry be, on
the tod of November:
a "Once moreinto the breech, good Mriends
once more!"
A Gord Omen.
Singular as It may seem, we regard
the election news from Ohio and
India a n ogury of future soc
sase. It will arouse the people of
other State from their lethargy,
and show them what they have to
contend against. The stolen money
of the goverament was freely used
by the bloated bondholders for polit
ial otet in those States, and t is a
- noted fact that "rpeaters" were i i
Sported from every available polnt.
Though Gen. Hancock can, and will
be, elected without the electoral vote
of either of those States, we would
advise our ilenda In that region to I
-watch the entucky shore. Tea

tmasported from that State, without

THE PURITAN AD THE BLACKLEG J
The attack on Gon. Hancock made
Sby that hirol (Itfanmer, U. 4. Orant,
and reported by Rt v. Dr. C. H. Fow
1 ler, was well timed, ard deliberately
planned. They and their employers f
were fully aware that lies and sland
D era however baseless will certainly
e take root in mean and envious m ands
1. and that the impression now made
can not be eradicated between this
V and the day of election. The attack '
I has therefore been purposely and
mollciouely delayed until now. The
a tools selected by the Garfield po
* liticians are also shrewedly chosen
and eminently fitted for the iota
t mous work in hand. The Rev. C. H.
Fowler evidently belongs to a well
I known class of men in the North
who have done more than all others
to inflame the evil passions of man
kind, and to keep alive sectional
malice, hatred and strife. The na
tural benevolence of the human heart
would long since have asserted it
self between the people of the two
seotlons but for the diabolical teach
I lngsof theorthN ernpualpit. Indeedso
atrocious have been these teacbohgs
Sthat those of like denominational
? fath in the outh have been forced
t to sever all ecolselastcal connection
t with these alumnlators of God and
slanderers of humanity in the North.
Who does not remember the memo
ridalsent in to Congress, some time
before the war, breathing vengeance
and hatred of the Southern people,
purporting to be signed by thirty
thousand ministers of the Gospel ?
Who does not remember therand s
synod of the Presbyterian aourch
North which assembled at Philadel.
phia soon after the war in whieh, in.
stead of preaching Christ and him
cruclfied, they solaced themselves by a
passing a series of blood-thirsty re
solutions calling upon the Federal
I government to visit the death penalty d
upOn Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee,
and to inflict "condgn punaishmet"
uI pon all rebels ? T
These are the blasphemous wretch
es who bring the religion of the of
gentle founder of Christianity into v
I disrepute and are doing more for the I
spread of Infidelity than all the Bob UI
SIngersolls on earth. No respectable d
man of the world will Identify him- tr
self with these bands of organized a'
hypocrites falsely called "ohurchee," C
because his self-respect will not al- II
low him to debauch his morale by I
such foul and disgusting associations. ri
What shall we ay of the other con aU .
spirator and assasin, U.. Orant,
the assoolate and confederate of tl

Sdangerous to our republican system t

arouse themselves from the lethargy i

"-Upon whom every god did seem to

To give the world asurance of a man."
Throughout the length and breadth
of this great land his name is hailed
with enthusiasm, for with his election
is secured the fruits of representsa
