It was a lovely spring evening as I
entered the wide graveled pathl that
led up to the broad porch of tlhe old
fashioned Vernon mansion. Squi'e
Vernon sat there smoking his mleer
schaum.

"It's a real lniauty to be able to take
a whiff out of doors, after being shut

Sensible old gentlemann ! hei had not
forgotten Ilhi own young days. I in
timlated, not without considerable I
awkwardness, that the special objett
of my visit had been to 'see Cecil."
"Well, she is in the parlor, all by
herself," said the Squire, good
hlumoredly, motioning ume in. "Walk
in-walk in."
Cecilia Vernon was sitting in the
parlor alone, as her father had sael,
the bright center of a cheerfuil circle
of lamplight. A bit of crochet-work
was lying in her lap, and an open
volume of po,s--poems I had sent
her was on the table.
Cecilia Vernon was always fair to
look upon, in my sight; to-.night,
however, she seemed more than or
dinarily beautiful.
I bat down, and began hesitatingly
upon the never-failing topic of the
weather. A proposal had seemed the
easiest thing in the world as I walked
along the dewy edges of the peace
ful starlight road, contemplating it i
from afar off; but now that I was
face to face with it, alps upon alps of
difficulty and perplexity seemed to
surround its aeeomplishment. I would
have given all that I was wdrth to
postpone the evil day but twents3
four hours-all but my self-respect,
and that was imperiled now.
Cecilia tried her best to keep the
ball of conversation in motion ; she
introduced new subjects, asked lead
ing questions, and feigned deep id=
terest in the most abstruse of topii.
oBut evoei Cecilia couldst talk on for
ever, and presently, with a little sigh
bf despair, she subsided into silence.
Now was the eventful moment of
m - deti ll!" I salid softly.
She raised the liquid brown eyes to
mine.
"I want to confide in you to night

"Certainly, Mr. Markham I"
"I am very much in love, Cecilia;
in fact my heart has long ago gone

I stopped, with the fatal husky
feelisfg in my throat. Cecilia was
blushing divinely I I drew my chair
elose to hers, with the sensation of a
man who has just pulled the string a
on a cold shower-bath.
"Who is the lady I" foldtred Cecilia,
as if lhe didn't know perfectly well
already.
"Shall I shllow you her pictdir, Co
cilia ?"
Miss Vernon inclined her head al
most to the level of my lshoaider to
look at the little earte de visite I drew
trom ty pot6t. I bkillfully tto3 6iIt

"See, dearest!
But, to my horror and dismay, she

"Cecilla! how-what--_

If there is one mean, numanly, nn
womanly piece of ilnjustice that ,ugght,
Miore thanu another, to arouse the
rig liteodts indignation of evtCiy true
maon and woman, it is this tirade
against "mothers-in-law" which has
become so noticeable in most news
plalwrs. 'l'here are, no dotbt, nloth -
era-in-la who aire melddllesomee, in.
terfering busy bodies; but, rest as
sured, the incident of their hIecoutiog
motihers-in-law does not make them
so. There alre-, t las ! young girls alntd
young mlarried womlei who Imssess in
the highest degree those very unde
tirable qualities. Naturally the mar
riage of their sons and daughters, in
after years, does not cure therm of
these evil liopensities ; it only gives
them a fresh field of :perations. But
because a disagreeable girl grows into
a lhateful, vicious womlan, and by her
unalnia|ble disposition makes her
children unhappy, and even contin
ties to torment tlllhe after they have
left her fireside, is that any just rea
son why the whole race of mothers
in-law should be ridiculed, slandered,
and unfeelingly insulted Is that I
any sensonl why our gentle, loving
mothers, ladies in thought, word and
deed, should be wounded every time
they take up their favorite papers by
the would-he wit of the vulgar off
spring of the class of women before
alluded to t
I have a motlher in-law; my hus
band has another perhaps neither of i
them would be considered angels by
our would-be wits, but in our house
hold the "moither-in-law" has never
once been used in a respectful man
ner. They are out children's dear
grandma's, and are loved and revered
as such. "
And, more than this, my love for I
my dear husband is more than doub
led ; his very fautlts sink into insig
nificauce in my eyes in view of the I
unvarying kindness and respect which
he has shown to my nmother diming
our ten years of married life.
It is all old saying that "when the I
young laugh at the old they laugh at a
themselves beforehand." This is par
tiantlnlat i~no thina case. I"or instance,
how could I, with any regard to my
own future, throw slurs at my moth. I
er-ian-law, when I myself asm a moth- I
er n How will it please me, after all I
the weary, sleepless nights, and an
ions days, which every true mother I
bestows upon her little ones, after all
the kisses and caresses and loving I
care lavished upon them, after I have I
subjected myself to jnntimerabte toils I
and privations that they may enjoy I
life-how will it please me, I say, af
ter a few more years of love and toil I
and care have fled, and my heart is as
full of love for my children as ever, I
to be stigmatized as an obnoxious'
creature whose death (speaking ac- i
cording to the sentiments of our witty º
friends) would be the signal for a
general jubilee ? And all this, be- -
cause to a stranger I shall have given
up my tenderly nurtured ones!
How any man or wointin who lhas '
ever loved a dear mother, how any I
man who loves or even respects his
wife, how any sensible womnian, canb
be guilty of such unkindness and
glaring injustice, passes my under
standing. thurie is a treat teal salidl
nowadays about the disrespect shlown
by children to old people; but hiowaI
can it be otherwise, when they leave
tihe example set them ill almost every
paper that meets their eye? Indeed,
with many, it seems to hIqve become
an article of belief tlnAt tie greatest
proof of intelligence and wit that can i
Ibe given is to open their silly moutlhi
and give ntteranes to an original or
plagiarized sentlmentj insulting to
thlose who, above nll others, are
worthy of netut aGectioni nd respect
