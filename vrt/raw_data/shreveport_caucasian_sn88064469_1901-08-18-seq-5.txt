follows: "I bare been deeply perturb

CONCERNING THE FIGURE.
The Artiel.; Which Is at the Fouada
tion or Present Good Form.
A few tmisguided persons have de
cried tl l new straight fronted, i corset
as unnatural, inelegant adul in other
u1ncopliun Intar11ly twi ns. Evrii the
hart s, i nee(e.ssary stockinlg support
ers usually attached to toll waist have
been des.e'itd as lathertn hands for
bolling the figure fo'ward in a posi
tion approxlmating the once stylish
Grecian bend.
Other clhJectors to the most sensible
corsets that have Ien I ilvented are
evidlently persons who have not re
alized that an IS inch waist represents
not bcunty. I, ut deform ity and, in the
preseni t sta te of fOllilxitle opinion, vul
garity a:lso. or that a womatn's natural
figure is not shaped like an hourglass.
THE RSTI.AOT FRONTED CORSET.
For many a long year war has been
waged against tight lacing, and at last
Dame Fashion has veered to the same
side: hence the new corset.
It is perfectly true that the straight
corset increases the size of the waist,
but it also decreases the size below the
waist and produces a slender, graceful
and naturally proportioned figure with
out exerting any of the pressure that
prevailed in the days when small
waists were fashionable.
It is, of course, absolutely necessary
that straight corsets should really be
cut to follow the lines of the figure ac
curately and give support only where
it is needed.
Suspenders attached to the corsets do
not pull the figure forward, but keep
the corset in place and prevent it slp
ping up or becoming unfastened, which
it is rather apt to do, a proof that it is
really easy fitting and comfortable.
A good deal of nonsense has also
been talked concerning what is termed
the "straight fronted walk," which has
been condemned by the critics of the
new corset as "assertive" and "affect
Now, there always will be women
who walk well and women who walk
badly. A few years ago, in the days of
tight lacing, the former were in a very
small minority. It was impossible for
a woman to walk well when her body
was so compressed that she was unable
even to breathe properly. But now
nearly all well bred women walk and
"carry themselves" beautifully, thanks
not only to the abandonment of tight
lacing and unduly high eels, but to
the fact that so many / s of sport
and exercise, tennis and fencing espe
cially, have become fashionable for
women and excellent aids to deport
ment, bestowing on their devotees
grace, agility and the art of balancing
the body to perfection.

In a mIodel lholse the refrigerator
stands lI a stutll, light roomi by the
back door. II is near enough to the
kitchen to be handy. There Is a green
cuirtain onl tIh back door window, to
pull down when a hot sun glares In on
the refrigerator. There Is a heavy
screen door that locks, and In hot
weather theres a linte, ool air coming
In till night. The house Is safe enough,
for an Inside door locks, and it is kept
shut Jihen the kitchen grows uncom
fortably hot.
It Is a mi,.take to set a refrigerator
down cellar. It Is easier for the Ice
:main and ht rdr for the woman who
does the work. The dampness swells
the wood till the door or lid won't shut.
There are cellar odors, no matter bow
clean it Is kept.
ln this moell' house a short bit of
hose Is kept hitched to the faucet for I
watering the lawn. The Ice Is washed
offh there, and the water has dripped
from it fairly well before It gets to the
back door. There's a clean, strong mat
at the foot of the steps.
An Iceman gets scolded unmercifully
for bringing dirt into a house. He can't
help It in places where he has to walt
five minutes for a dipper of water to
wash off the ice or go and get it him
self, and e can't wipe hlas feet on a
piazza floor.
He has a hundred people waiting for
him on a hot morning, and It makes
him tired to open a lid and find he has
got to lift out half a dozen muskmel
ons, a pan of milk, a chicken and a
custard, all sltting around a chunk of
clee no bigger than your fist.
As soon as thee s put In It Is tuck

This model refrigerator is kept spot
lessly clean. Once a week the shelves
and . racks are washed in hot suds,
rinsed in strong hot soda water, then I
in almost boiling water. They are
wiped dry and set out doors to air.
If asnything has been spilled, it is
aerapel off, and then a flne pointed I
skewer picks out the corners and

a flexible wire that has a cloth wound I
about the end of It, and boiling hot
soda water Is poured through. _

coverings, and very smart these com
fortable little wraps are, with their
loose fronts and their wide cuffed
sleeves permitting the most perishable
of undersleeves to be slipped in with
out fear of damage. These are made
in flowered taffetas or white cloth,
with deep turndown collar, and the
edges trimmed with a fluffed out ruch
ing.
Many of the linen gowns are made'
with three shaped flounces narrowing
in the front and widening considerably
at the back, and large sailor collars
figure on the bodices. The painted
uasilcs are simply exquisite and show
tiny roses and marguerites. They are
popularly made with shaped flounces
at the hem and pretty, soft falling
flchus, which are often united on the
front by a couple of straps of black
.~lvet.
Black velvet becomes almost monot
onous from its insistent appearance.
Every hat has its note of black, usually
a bow or knot of velvet behind, while
the unfailing clou to the toilet is given
by tags or rosettes of black velvet on
skirt and bodice.
Lacings of bebe ribbon are fashion
able at the sides of skirts and are used
to connect the fronts of corselet belts.
Illustrating some of these features
are the two cuts. First is a fron frou
gown strewn with pompadour wreaths,
either painted or embroidered, to which
ne of the new sacks gives additional
bhic. This sack is in pink crepe de

rosettes down the fronts.

white straw, trimmed with white chif

Invalid Cookery.
Rice caudle is an excellent remedy
for any case where a sudden chill has
brought on diarrhea. Soak some rice
for an hour in cold water, strain it and
put two tablespoonfuls of the rice into
rather more than a pint of new milk.
Simmer till it will pulp through a
sieve. Put the pulp and milk into a
saucepan with a bruised clove, a liitth
cinnamon and sugar to taste. Siuinor
ten minutes more. If too thick, add a
little more milk. Serve with veiy thin

1 ý1
ETANINE DRESS WITH CRETONNE APPLIQU.
model gowns for the coming season
have narrow shirred ruffles of it in be
tween others of the dress material or
lace.
The skirts are to be as long as the
woman owning them can walk lu and
Sft tightly around the hips and flare
widely around the bottom. That makes
it necessary to trim the bottom quite
lavishly in the matter of flounces, and
these are always finer when edged or
headed by black velvet ribbon in some
way or another. In thin stuffs the rib
bon is run in and out the little holes 1w
the lace made and provided for just
such needs. And it is unlversally
pretty so. •
To return to the use of cretonne as
trimmins, I present an illustration of
a striking gown made with this idea
the principal one. The dress Is of ecru
etamine, cut with the seam down the
front, which we all know gives a shape
that no other style of cutting does. It
is long and lined with cherry red silk,
which shows faintly through the
meshes of the cloth. Around the entire
skirt twice is a trimming made of ovals
of cretonSe, the pattern being violets
and their foliage In tiny yellow bas
kets. These ovals are outlined with a
close lace insertion a quarter of a,
Inch wide in ecru, and this Is wrought
into bowknots. This is much easier
to do than to buttonhole the cretonne
down or to sew it fast with metal
thread.
The waist Is In form of a shore
basque, with the same trimming, but
the ovals are cut closer and finished to
be smaller. The same trimming is put
on the sleeves. This basque is to be
worn over a white Japanese waist
with full bishop sleeves and full front.
The dip belt and the tie are both of
black velvet, with spikes at all the
ends. On the sides of the 'ili stock
are three straps of the same ending
under gilt buttons. En passant one
may say that the spikes for a finish at
the ends of ribbon trimmings are out?
and metal acorns and little gilt balls
are shown in their places.' 1I
Yesterday I saw many of the new
materials for fall and winter, and can
say that fine and firm cashmere ina
smooth weave and rather glossy sur
face will be a favorite. It Is produced
in all the rich warm colors inseparable
from the season, and also in black.
Cashmere is always a nice mater'aL,
but this season they have given it a
new surface, so rich and smooth that
it could readily pass for cloth. It wears
well and drapes well. For trimming
this is a new line of Persian braid and
galloon. Galloons are to be very fash
ionable for all sorts of trimming this
coming season, and though they are
rather dear. they will be so very effect
ive that women will have them no
matter what they cost. There is one
kind made of black silk mull with the
figure wrought in it with heavy silk
and chenille. This is exceptionally
'handsome. It is especially so over
