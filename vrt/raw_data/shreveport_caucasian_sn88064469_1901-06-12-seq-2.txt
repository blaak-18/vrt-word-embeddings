THE HICKS OBDINANCE.
The Hicks ordinance, providing
for the sale of eight lots of balturi
property to the Uottou Belt lot
$25,000, was withidrawn at the beusioi
of the City Council held Monday
night.
In withdrawing the ordinance, Mr
flicks explained that he nor the sup
porters of the measure had antici
paled the opposition that had bten
urged against.
The Hicks ordinance has been fully
reviewed and discussed in the Cau
casian, which connot refrain from
expressions of regret in this failure
of obtaining money which was In
tended for the erection of one or two
public school building by the city.
Woat has been gained and what
advantage can be derived ? As
already demonstrated, the bat nre
which is leased, will yield no greater
Irevenue, and there will be no pnblic
school building for the children of
the people of Shreveport.
The School Board propose to sup
ply the need of public school houses,
in the Shreveport School District, bý
a levy, through the Police Jury, of
$76,000O, but in the meantime it may
be two years and more before the
proposition, if it be endorsed by the
taxpayers, can be carried into practi.
eai execution.
It is the Canucasian's opinion that
the bchaol Board has erred, in Inter
posing opposition to the sale of this
batture, when the money-$25,000
and may be $80,000-would have
been invested in at l6asl two pablic
school houses in the corporate l'mits
of the ciLty.
But as the School Board had de
clared that they dia not want these
school houses from the city and only
expect the revease from the lease of
the batture lota, and as there was
another factor, in opposition to the
sale but is in favor of long leaes, and
as the people most dirttly concerned
failed to mafest any interest in this
nii, what was more natural than
br Mr Hicks to withdraw the ordi
sance ?
The position of the Caucasian in
this issu was deelded. We favored
the proposition, which promisld an -
stantal becHets to the city and espe
elally to the children of the public
schools, and therefore the Caucasian
was in accord with Mr Hicks and the I
eoauelmen who sustained the ordi.
