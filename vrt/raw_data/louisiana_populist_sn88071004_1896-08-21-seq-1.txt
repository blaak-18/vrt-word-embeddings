People's Party Plat
form.
FMll Text of the one Adopted
f At St. Loens.
The following is the platform and res
olutions adopted at St. Louis by
the People's Party Convention, Gen. J.
B. Weaver being chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions:
The People's party assembled in na
ftional convention, reaflfnrs its allegi
ance to the principles declared by the
founders of the republic, and also to the
fundamental principles of just govern
ment as enunciated in the platform of
the party in 1892. We recognize that
through the connivance of the present
and previous administrations the coun
f try has reached a crisis in its national
Ife predicted in our declaration four
years ago, and patriotic action is the su
preme duty of the hour. We realize
N that while we have political independ- '
ence our financial and Industrial inde
pendence Is yet to be attained by res
tnring to our country the constitutional '
control nud exercise of the functions
noecessary to a people's government.
which functions have been basely sur- 1
rendered by our public servants to cor
rupt monopolies. The influence of the
Republican money changers has been I
more potent in shaping legislation than
the voice of the American people, ex
ecutive power and patronage have been I
used to eaflpt our admstrles and
defeat the will of the people, and
plutocracy has been enthroned upon the 4
ruins of Democracy. To restore the
government intended by the fathers anad
for the welfare and prosperity of thisl
and future generations, we demand the
establishment of an economical fnan
cial system which shall make us masters
of our own affairs and independent of
European control, by the adoption of
the following declaration of principles:
FIANCEL
1. We demand a national money,
safe andd sound, irsed by the general I
government only, without the iatervem
tion of beaks of lee, to be a fll legal
tender for dets, phlic agcd private, and
a Jst, equitable and eeltu a means of
distribution direct to the people sad
through the lawful dist rsemets of the
government,
I. We demand the free and nairs
stricted colnage of silver and gold at
the present legal ratio of 16 to 1, with
out waiting for the consent of foreign
nations,
.a We demand the volume of dree
lating aedluse he speedily increased to
an amount. sufficient to meet the de
mands of the business population of
this country and to restore the just level
of prices of labor and production.
4. We denounee the sale of bonds
and the increase of the pubile interest
bearing bonded debt made by the present
administration, as unneoegsr and with
out authority of law, and dmiad that
no more bonds be lased exempt by a
specific act of congress.
I We demand suc leegal Islshatle
Swill prvent the dUas i of
