TIsdcedagerous bedfellows were aen

cap-d6or spiders: Of the three I al
pyaw isid thbe greatest dread-.of the
"orpions,` partly, perhaps, on aecount
of their greater bulk, but more, I
think, because of their villainous
temper.
So far as I have observed, the taran
tula will only visit a house or even a
camp in search of flies or other food,
. and he will usually quickly retreat if
his way is clear.
- So, too, the centipedes as a rule pre
fer to hide under washboards or in
" damp cellars and decaying timbers,
only coming out after food, such as
roaches and croton bugs.

fore I had time to drop it I received a
painful wound from the fang of a large
scorpion.
Another time, desiring to take an
afternoon sirsta in i ny hammock, I
shook out the shawl spread over it, and
from the folds fell a good sized female
scorpion. Having respread my shawl
I turned over the pillow to beat it up,
when from under it there dOopped over
24 baby scorpionts. The young scor
pions usually travel from point to
point on the mother's back, but while
she is foraging around for food they
are generally to be found in hiding
near by, as was this little colony. Over 1
70 young ones have been found with p
one female.
The poison from these creatures is I
applied in three different ways, thouglý
the poison itself is much the same and I
similar in action.
The fang of the scorpion is at the
very tip of its long, flexible tail, as the
abdomen appears to be, and with it the I
creature can deal itself quite as deadly I
a blow as it can to any enemy. This it
will do. just as described in one of By- 1
ron's poems, if it be surrounded with a i
circle of fire and assured of its inability I
to escape. This I have tested quite a
score of times, thus disproving claims 1
of certain naturalists, who probably I
never saw a live scorpion, that Byron a
invented the story to suit his rhyme. t
The amount of poison in the scorpion t
will not. in my opinion, kill a healthy r
adult, although it will castse an amount
of pain for some hours that is most
difficult to bear with fortitude, as I
can testify from personal experience.
lIut a large female scorpion certainly
can cause death to a half-grown child
or to a timid woman, or a man whose
blood is in a bad or impure condition.
The tarantula carries its poison at
the base of the most savage-looking
fangs. that hang down from the lower
side of its head. Owing to their po
sition, the term "bite" may be more
correctly applied to the tarantula than
to either of the others; it is, neverthe
less, not a bite, but a sudden down
ward stroke of the fangs into the ob
ject attacked.
I have never foundanyone who lnew
of a case where a centipede wounded a
man without first having been stepped
on, rolled on or in some like manner
hurt. Its poison is a much more di
lute fluid than that of the others and
is exuded from the hollow feet.
A centipede that I rolled on with my
naked back in my sleep on the little I
steamer that plies on the San Juan
river in Nicaragua left a thick red
ridge as wide a's my thumb quite
across my back, but there were no
holes in my skin that a friend with a
pocket lens could discover. Its poicon
is much less serious in effect than that a
of the other, not much worse than a t
row of hornet stings would be; but, al
though the least painful of these three
sometime bedfellows, it is quite bad j
enourh.

NEW ARTIFICIAL FUEL.
Produced by the Admlxture of White
Powder with Coal Dust.
Additional tests of a satisfactory
character have been made of a tiew
artificial fuel produced by the admix
ture of a white dry powder with coal
dust in certain proportioas. Pitdh is
the combining medium almost uni
versally employed for utilizing coal
waste, but it involves certain practic
al objections in storage and use
which, ibis claimed, are overcome by
the new process. The composition of
the powder employed in this ease is
not made known, but it is said to dih
slast of two iattiual substances, both oi
which are plentiful dnd inexpensiv; e
bnd do not give out noxious fumes in
combustion nor exert any deletei-ious
influences whateveu upon the boiler
plates of fines. Tests show that, as
compared with anthracite coal, the
blocks made of this material are of de
cided value when used in a boiler fur
nace. That is, it was found that the
total horse power developed by the
boiler with the tanthracite coal in its
batural condition was 868.1, while with
blocks of the new material it was
506.0--this computing twenty jotIzids
of water per hour, according to the
rule; as e qual to i indicated horse
power; reckoning, however, fifteen
pounds of waterper hour as equal to 1
indicated horse power, as is customary
with the best triple expansion oii'
gines, the total horse power developed
with the bricks was 673, dgainst 491
with the natural coal.
NEW PREPARED PAPER.
Why Its Inventor Has Been Refused a
German Patent.
The Droguisten Zeituing is responsi
ble for.the statement that in Germany
a patent has been refused, and the
mnan~tacture and sale have been pro
hibited, of a paper so prepared that
any ink writing upon its surface could
be erased by the simple application of
a moist sponge. The paper was made
of the ordinary ingredients, with the
addition of asbestoC and parchment
glue. The paper pulp, after rolling,
was immersed for a short time (from
six to thirty-five seconds, according to
the thickness of the paper to be pre
pared from it) in concentrated sul
phuric acid at 20 degrees, diluted with
10 to 15 per cent. of water. It was
then pressed between glass rollers,
passed successively through water,
ammonia solution, and a second time
through water, strongly pressed be
tween rollers and dried on felt
rollers, and, finally, on polished
and heated metal rollers. The
finished carticle is said to be pre
cisely like ordinary paper. Its sale
has been prohibited on account of the
misuse to which it can be put.
Progreash in Etrletricy.
A remarkable illustration of the
progress of electrical appliances is
electrolytic painting. Hitherto, if cop
peror other metalwere to be deposited
electrically, a bath of solution was
needed. Now this is changed and a
technical journal says a ship's hull can
be plated as easily as a spoon or tera
pot. Instead of a bath, insoluble salts,
ground to a fine powder and mixed
with water, are used. This mixture is
painted on the metal to be plated by a
fine wire brush, to which one pole of a
dynamo conductor is attached, the
other pole being connected' with a
plate. Not only pure metal, but all
sorts of alloys ecn be used.

Put chaff cushions over the frames as

sacks and filled with wheat chaff. The
chaff acts as an absorbent, and will
prevent the accumulation of moisture
in the hive, besides retaining the riii

within it, pack the space between the
walls with chaff, making provision for
the bees to pass through this space by a
small tunnel into the air through an
opening in the outer ease, correspond
ing to the entrance to the hine.
Such a device, when properly de=
fended from rain and mice, will be of
invaluable advantage to the bees, in
keeping up uniformity of temperature
during the long, dild, freezing spells of
gloomy winter.
Wintering bees safely is the great
point in successful apiculture. Those
who can do this well need not despair
in making a buccess of bees add honey.
As this has been and still is the dead
point of the business, nearly all failures
have been here. By successful winter
ing we not only mean the preservation
of the life of our bees until the return
of spring, but also that they shall be
sufficiently numerous to pass the sev
eral trials of spring in safety, and have
their hives overflowing with bees at
the opening of the honey flow. This
is successful wintering, and when it is
accomplished our labors will be
crowned with abundant success.-Wil
liam liallantine, in American Farmer.
AMONG THE POULTRY.
1T is our opinion that you will hate a
better potato crop next-season if some
of those 'seed potatoes" you are saving
are boiled and fed to the hens during
the winter.
IF you have any thought of improv
ing your flock-infusing new blood into
it-now is the best time to do it. Good
young cockerels can be bought for less
money now than in the spring.
1i the water dish is kept in the hen
house have one that does not leak.
Some houses are made damp by the
amount of water that leaks out of the
drinking vessel Dry quarters are
needed to give health and vigor to
poultry.
WVE believe in fresh air for poultry,
but it seems to us that the cold and
melancholy winds that play around the
tree tops just now must be a little too
fresh for the good of those hens that
are compelled, for lack of better shel
ter, to roost in them.
IF your henhouse is small, its bor
ders may be enlarged so as to give a
sunning place for the hens this winter
by building a shed. A north side and a
roof will do if no more can be provided.
Take some poles, make a frame and
bank up and cover with straw and the
deed is done.
Poattoes for Youag PIg.
An excellent addition to the milk
given to young pigs-and the mixture
is also valuable for pigs of a larger
growth-will be found in the potatoes
that are too small for the market.
Even where the largest varieties are
grownm, and good cultivation, there will
be some potatoes which are not large
enough to sell and which are not de
sirable for seed. The great majority of
kinds, especially when not highly cul
tivated, have quite a proportion of un
marketable tubers. It pays well to
save these small potatoes and feed them
to the pigs. Before being offered to
the pigs the potatoes should be washed
and boiled.
How to FIteure Pioeslt.
In computing the income from live
stock we must consider what is put on
the farm as well as what is sold off it;
and in our practiee in stock growing
we should consider that poor food 1
makes poor manure. Starving the ani- 1
mals is starving the land. Food that
fats the animal makes mannre that fats 1
the land. The menure from a certain
weight of good elover hay is worth
three times as much. fronm theat bran
six times as mueh, from oil Oake meal i
nine times as antih and -from ootton
seed meal twelve times yag mach, asthe

As cold weather comeseon the number

may be materially lessened by the use

FOR A PtULLING HORSE.
A Halter Which No Anhnal Will inete
Succeed in Breaking.
An excellent halter for a pulling
horse is one made as shown in the as
companying eut. It is similar to the
otnminn halter, except that the chin
strap is double and the ring be which
the horse is fastened-attaches to only
one of the pieces, forming a noose
which tightens upon the horse's jaw
whenever he pulls. When the puller
finds he accomphshes nothing except
his own discomfiture, he is usually will
ing to give up the effort. The entire
halter must be strong, so he will never
succeed in breaking it. A colt should
never be tied with anything weaker
than a half-inch manilla rope, that he
may never learn his power. -A. C. West,
ie Farm and Hiome.
Introduclnel New Bloond.
When the flock is to be improved by
procnring males from elsewhere, the
farmer should so arrange his yards a
to know what to expect. If he turns
bthe newly acqured male out to become
a member of the flock, where there i ay
be other males, his object may not be
iattnained. The proper plan to pursue
is to select the best hens in the fock,
about one dozen, and.place them in a
yard wihth the selected btile in the
spring, about a month before the time
for hatching the chicks arrives. It will
do no harm to allow all of the hens to
be together during the winter, pnr
vided they are separated as mentioned,
In the spring. If new blood is to be in
troduned you must be sure that you
_re ascomplishing your purpose, which
demands personal attention until the
hatehing season is over, when the
males will no longer be required.
