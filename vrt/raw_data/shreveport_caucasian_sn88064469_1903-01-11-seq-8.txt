Object to the Restraints of the Sunday

Serwich. Dads Bro*., J. E. McAdams,
E. Bogngeat, P. Draiss, J. W. Selsor,

M. C. Elstner and Pinckaey Wells, Jr.,
called ot, the city comptroller, Mr. C.
G. Rives, for 'the' purpose of paying
their license fo rthe year 1903. Through
their attorneys, M. C. Elstner and
Mr. Wells, the amount of each license,
$500 less the deductions for Sunday.
which were tendered and declined, and
on that, may follow a test case in court.
The license. $3'o, was then paid under
protest for each of the 'saloons. The
question if tested would be a novelty,
and, while no lawyer, the opinion may
be expressed that the decision would be
in favor of the city. It could not be held
that the city is discriminating against
saloons as to the requirements of clos
ing .ot Sundays. Every kind of business
for which a license is issued--except
such as are exempted by law-must be
closed and keep closed on Sundays The
sloons are not of the excepted class;

'sgaged in trade and traffic.
