SUN)DAY. MARCH 22z 1903.
A New York physician says: "If your
baby has the grip, don't kiss it. If your
stenographer has the grip, send her
home.
The constitutionality of the Wilson
act, which provides separate seats in
street cars for colored and white people
has been sustained by the Supreme
Court of Louisiana.
The Mansfield Journal says: "A
monthly magazine is published in De
troit called 'The Smiths.' It is intended
mainly for the Smith family and ought
to have a big circulation. Through it the
Smiths may learn something of the
founder of their family.'
The Commoner: Mr. Cleveland says
he is out of politics save as an adviser.
The Democratic party would land in the
Republican camp if it followed Mr.
Cleveland's example, and the example a
man sets is always a better index to his
character than his precepts 're.
One-twentieth of the men in New
York city, according to Mr. Jerome, arc
in the habit of indulging in alcoholic
drinks on Sunday. But who is authority
for Mr. Jerome? One-twentieth is a very
conservative. estimate and leads to the
conclusion that nineteen-twentieths take
to water, which is improbable.
The Commoner says: "Mr. McKinley
charged in i8gt that Mr. Cleveland, dur
ing his first administration, tried tc
'make money scarcer and therefore dear
er-money the master and all things else
the servant.' If that terrible indictment
was true then, it is true now, for Mr.
Cleveland has never announced a change
of purpose."
It is reported from Washington that
strong opposition is being developed
against the leadership of Gorman by the
younger element of the Democracy in
the United States Senate. In explana
tion it is said that "as a matter of fact,
the principal point of difference between
the 'old' and the 'new' crowds in the
Senate is afforded by the fact that the
'old' element is altogether too inactive
to suit the younger and more vigorous
men."
Labor is so contented and happy and
prosperous that the general government
for the first time in history has deemed
it necessary to distribute "riot car
tridges" to the governors of the different
states.-The Commoner.

states" of the North, where the "con
tented and happy and prosperous" lab

POLITICS AND JUDICIAL FUNC
TIONS.
What are the chief duties and respon
sibilities of the judicial officers in our
government? The usual coure of judges
is to be retired, and hold themselves
aloof from all party contentions, and
free from all entangling alliances which
grow out of party politics. The reply
of Judge Parker of the New York Court
of Appeals to an invitation to attend a
Democratic meeting as a prospective
candidate for president, is to be highly
commended, that was, that he did not
feel that he could take part in the meet
ing on account of his being a judge,
whose duties are not political but strictly
judicial. Such a strict rule of offieial
coeduct does not seem to be the course
of judges in Louisian. We have the
spectacle of two of our higher judges
mnaking themselves prominent in seeking
ofaides, attending meetings.gotten up
in their interest, they being prominent
leders therein. It is impossible for
.jlsdgeto divide their allegiance. When
4 ind they should leave nothing an
*us i~s
occupy. In fact it is a bid for something
in the future, which will add to or make
po5sitir an.d office higher and better thati
that which they h(old, andl which will
pa-< fronm thitn.
Tlhi- principle is co .ipician!-ly v iet
f rth in the life and conduct of Sir
i ranci .con. \lWhen a a awecr, a
a ht irer if the crown, and as a judge
and chancellor hie was i '.ceker after ,f
icc. lie ,ol<cribedc to all the arbitrary
power of the king. le proscc't ed the
inoble Exse:, vwho had exerted hitmself to
elevate Bacon to high n;ice. tie says iit
his friend: "By no means ie ,um per
stnaded to interpose yourseif either iby
word or letter in any cac ,i pendintg in
any court of justice. If it should pre
vail. it perverts justice: but if the judge
he so just and of such courage as he
ought to be, as not to be inclined there
by; yet it always leaves a taint of sus
picion behind it. Like Ovid, he saw and
approved the right, and yet the wrong
pursued. He took bribes and offices and
I titles freely bestowed upon him, and
amassed great wealth, for thrift followed
fawning. He became lord chancellor of
England. But the day of reckoning
came at last. A greater power than
royalty was abroad in the land, and be
coming conscious of itself, it disclosed
that the lord chancellor had accepted
large sums of money from litigants in
cases that were depending before him.
I It was a pitiful end of a great career,
the just and equitable doom of all intel
lect when it is divorced from conscience.
"'If. therefore * * * *
Parties allure thee, think how Bacon
shined,
The wisest, brightest, meanest of man
kind."
What a contrast is shown in the life
and character of Sir Eward Coke, who
was a great lawyer and a great judge.
He gave himself entirely and unreserv
edly to the study of the law, and left his
visible and everlasting impress upon it.
He became chief justice of the court of
common pleas, and subsequently chief
justice of the court of king's bench. In
this position the sterling traits of his
character became apparent. The judge
ships were held at the pleasure of the
king, and a disagreement with him upon
any matter which affected the royal pre
rogative involved the possibility of sum
mary dismissal from the judicial office.
But Coke never permitted a selfish re
gard for his own interest to interfere
with the performance of a public duty.
When upon the suggestion of Arch
bishop Bancroft the king claimed for
himself the right of "judging whatever
cause he pleased in his own person, free
from all risk of prohibition or appeal,"
Coke denied his right to do so, and
quoted from Bracton: "The king ought
I na to be under any man, but is under
God and the law." Finally in a case of
I ecclesiastical preferment, Coke with the
concurrence of his associate judges, de
clined to delay the decision of the case
at the command of the king until he
might express to them his views con
cerning it, and rendered judgment. The
judges were summoned before the king
to explain their conduct, and were un
mercifully scolded by him for their dis
obedience. All of them were bullied into
1 makiig acknowledgements, except Coke.
Being ask.ed what he would do in a case
where the king's prerogative was in
volved, he said: "When the case hap
pens I shall do that which shall be fit
for a judge to do.; Can we not stop and
ask the question, is there no outside in
fluences, political or otherwise, that has
an influence on judges? Their own con
duct must be an answer to this question.

Clever Spiders.
I took a large spider from his web
under the basement of a mill, put him
on a chip of wood and set him afloat
on the quiet waters of the pond, says a
naturalist. lHe walked all about the
sides of his bark, surveying the situa
tion very carefully, and when the fact
that he was really atlont and about a
yard from shore seemed to be fully
comprehended he looked out for lie
nearest land.
This point fairly settled upon. he im
mediately began to cast a webt for it.
He threw it as far as possible in the
air and with the wind. It soon reached
the shore and made fa:t to the spires
of grass. Then he turned him.self about
and in true sailor fashion began to haul
in hand over hand on his cable. C'are
fully he drew upon it until his Ibrk
began to move toward shore. As it
moved the faster, he the faster drew
upon It to keep his hawser taut and
from touching the water. Very soon lie
reached the shore and quickly leaping
to terra firma. sped his way homeward.
Thinking that he might be a special
expert and an exception in that line of
boatmanship to the rest of his com
panions. I tried several of them. They
all came to shore in like manner.
Flat Life.
In such a dwelling as the average
"flat" of the north and west the pri
vacy of home is reduced to a minimum.
The footsteps of the tenants, the roll
ing of their perambulators, the cries of,
their children, the varied odors of their
breakfasts, lunches and dinners. are
omnipresent and not to be banished
even by mental science. If they are
musically inclined, the others must lis
ten perforce, and have no other redress
than to begin counter performances.
Some cheerful writer said, "VWhile a
man can sing he can work," but the
trouble often is that while he is sing
ing other people are unable to work.
Such forced participation in the lives
of others is irritating and upsetting to
the nerves, and though we may be wili
ing to weep with those who weep and
rejoice a ith those who rejoice we
would prefer to have some choice in
the matter.--New Orleans Times-Dem
ocrat.

Worked a Problem While Asleep.
An Amsterdam banker once request
ed a professor of mathematics to work
out a very intricate and puzzling prob
lem for him. The professor, thinking
the matter good exercise for the intel
lectual faculties of his pupils, men
tioned it to them and requested them
to work out the enigma. One of the
students, who had pondered deeply
over the intricate subject during the
day. retired to bed. Some time after
-rward h arose, dressed, and, seating
himself at his desk, worked out the
problem accurately, covering sheets of
paper with his calculations. He had
no recollection in the morning of hav
ing done so.
Circus Horses Work Hard.

An Odd Fish.
One of the odldest fishes that ever
swam in any sea is that known to nat
uralists under the unattractive name of
ophiocephalus. A species of it is found
in the sea of Galilee, where it builds a
nest which for beauty of design and el
egance of workmanship excels the ef.
forts of the majority of feathered nest
builders. Its favorite spot for building
is in an old root or rock projecting un
der the water. and the material con
sists of seaweed. grass and leaves.

tlizabethan Exeise Laws.
ih striking contrast to the present
laws to prevent habitual drunkenness
were those passed in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. The Lansdowne manuscripts
in the British museum record that in
1594 orders were set down by the lords
and others of her majesty's privy coun
sel for the reformation of the great dis
orders committed by the &xcessive
number of alehouses. Whicht the jus
tices were ordered to reduce. The pub
licans were compelled to give to the
constable of the parish the name and
business of every one who frequented
their houses and were forbidden to
have any games played therein. On
Sundays no persons dwelling within a
mile of the public house were allowed
to enter except substantial household
ers traveling to church, and then only
for a reasonable time to refresh them
selves. Curiously, the chief complaint
against publicans was the "brewing
stronger ale and beer than is whole
some for man's body."-London Chron
icle.
