ARREST OF JAMES II. COSROVE.
On Tuesday, 19th inst., a portion
of the 7th United States Cavalry in
company with a deputy United States 1
Marshal, arrived in our quiet and
peaceable little city. They immedi
ately retired to what is known as "the
Pump Spring," where they hastily ar
ranged their camp, tents, &c., when
the leaders of the Radical party of
this place impatient for the work to
begin, sent for the U. 8. deputy Mar
shal, and after a long interview the
task of intimidation and arrest be
gan. A detachment of soldiers comn
manded and lead on by the deputy
Marshal under the guidance of one
Henry Boullt; son of D. H. Boullt,
the resigned tax collector Of this par
ihb, came up to Front street through
St. Denis, where they halted for a few
moments. After a whispered consul
tation with the said Boullt, a portion
started up and a portion down Front
street at a double quick, the deputy
Marshal being accompanied by his
ever faithful gpide, Boullt.
At the intersection of Front and
Washington, streets they met two
gentlemen in a buggy, coming from
Grand Ecore, when the word halt was
given by a United States soldier, arm
ed with a six-shooter in his hand,
and up rides the afore-mentioned
Bonllt, acting in the capacity of sub
assistant deputy Marshal, and with
what courage he hould command,
meekly informs Mr. Cosgrove that he
is nader arrest. "And who are you,
who dares arrest a gentleman on the
public highway," says Cosgrove. "Oh,
don't blame me," stammers out the
ever-to-be-remembered, Boullt. "I
am only assisting the deputy Mar
shal." "Where is your authority for
this outrage," demands Coegrove, but
no authority, no warrant, and po
semblance of power, save the pres
ence of the armed Uaited States sol
diers, was produced, and away he was
huarried. Thus on the public high
way, without warrant, without the
shadow of authority, except the over
awing attendanee of United States
soldiers, in sight of the stars and
stripes floating in the free breezes of
Republican America," the Editor of
the Nathbitoehes Vrdimeor, was ta

Colored Men, Read and Ponder.
Let our colored citizens give a lit
tle thought to, their situation and
consider what they owe to the coun
try in return for the uses and privi
leges of citizenship, and we feel as
sured they cannot longer continue to
be guided as in the past, by narrow
minded men bent upon individual
preferment for the sake of plunder;
men having no friendship for any
class, save that in companionship en
gendered by a mutual desire for spoils
--the intimacy that unites bands of
thieves; who would, and have sacri
Seed every person that does not en
ter fully into the idea of plundering
the people of the South without rea
son or mercy; and we are further
satisfied the reflections of any color
ed men who chooses to ponder on our
situation; on the history of Radical
rule in our parish, on the rule of
Blunt, Bouillt, Myers, and the like
characters; will lead him to regret
his past conduct, and endeavor to be
guided in future in his public duties
in a more enl!ghtened manner. That
he will not suffer himself to be ledian
blind obedience to do evils that can
only reflect upon himself in the end.
Let the colored voters of Natchito
ches look at the enormous taxes heap
ed upon as, for no earthly purpose
but to fee officials, and then ask them
selves who is responsible for it? And
who has in the long run to foot the
bills?
You, as colored voters, have by
your combined alliances, by your
sworn and blind obedience to the be.
heats of a few desperate demagogues,
placed over the tax-payers of this
parish, the most villainous set of men
in Louisian, so proaoiced by yoar
sem lders is ale Orlans. We lrve
been thaus far charitable enough to
accredit you with lit a small hare
of responsibility, rather excusing you
upod the plea, which yeu set up your
selves, of ignorance; rather have we
placed the accouatability for the cass
es of the ruin in consequence of your
bad government, upon the heads of
the unprincipled men who really are
but efecfts; and is now remains for
you to decide whether you are not
wholly wrong, and the "great cause"
yourselves. By your vote now will
yo be judged. All opportunities pre
vious to this, when we importuned
yoq to lpeed what we were telling
would be the consequence of this rule
of irresponsible parties, you have al
lowed to pass without availing your
selves of the exigence, or hearken to
our remonstrances. We have pa
tiently abided the iunevitable logico of
events, and the result of the had
government we knew, and so inform
ed yoa, was to be the fruits of your
conduct; and we now ask you, for
the last time, for the sake of shame,
of deceney, and of peace, to have
done with these men-men from
whom none of us ha'e enjoyed bene
fits, who are responsible for the con
dition under which we labor, and
who are again soliciting your suf
frage.'
These men have been proven to
youa as thieves, and liars, and it now
remains to be seen whether you de
tire to make yourselvesparticep er u
faIs. Ye:ouwill have an opportunity
la a measure, to undo part of the bad
that ihas been done by your combiue
tioon, that opportunity will oeeour on
the frst Monday in November. Is it
reasonable fr us ~ hop that you
havea st Ialearnt siwisap., that sad
and bitter experience hue taught you
a more useful lesson, and a laese
more to be heeded thau our words to
yjou in the past;or mst it requi
somUvag m .ore to conviee you of
two things, that this government,
reeking with dishonor and felony will
ruina as all beyond hope, that the
white citwsna will never consent that
the micreants who 'iave in the past
pluandered, shall not in the future
have an opportnnilty. We. ar not

Colonization.
Itseems that the poor negro of the
South is about to be abandoned by t
the philantropio masses of the North, t
to the tender mercies of the earpet- .
bagger saod callawag, feeling, no
doubt, that to longer continue with
his support and his attendent bad rule
would lose to them the control of the
Northern and more to he desired d
States.
The colored man has, as a voter,
done some Iood to the Radical party;
but that good is more than overbal- t
anced by the bead the paity, by bise
help has done the country at large;
and as "scapegoats" have been, with 1
criminals, in order from time imme
morial. Excuses handy to telieve
parties in power from Just odium for
bad government, the poor Afrian t
citizen, the substential part of the
party in power in the South, are to
be loaded with its sins and packed r
of, bag and baggage, to Liberia.
Truly, this is poor reward for their
gress services, for their vaunted and
patriot ue of eitisenship-that when
they become powerless as machines
to oppress, work evil to and plunder
the Southern white man, they must be
summarily gotten rid of by a whole
sale shipment to some foreign Country
-for fear, we conjeclqre, the poor be
ings will soon learn that the parting
parasites of tha northern freedom

Let the colored man reflect upon this 1
startlingproposition and ask himaself
if thlsis a graelous retura for all he
hasdone for the great party of"moral 1

it seems that the "affliction" of these
characters is becoming chronic. The R
poor pigmies are ever ready to vol- a

has past, and it is really startling to g
see .them now rushing around as if g
the whole matter of salvation for our I
people rested upon their shoulders.
Will they never learn that MrE a

for profit, and further that not one of a
them posess the confidence or res- e
pect of a decent person in the parish. ,
We have become tired of these chil- l
dren, in the semblence of men, and a
hope we shall not have occasion to ,
refer in future to their whining, boot- L
licking conduct. Let them retire to
the shades and silence of a private i
life, and enjoy the infamy their con r
duet towards a true and pure people ,
have earned them. Let them sink -
Into unknown graves, unworthy the

crawls through a miserable life, for
they have earned no reputation save t
that of sycophants, and as such, will t
receive but the scorn and Indignation
of all true men.
We desire to impress upon our 1
white citizens, upon those honorable ,
and patriotic men, who have so nobly t
done their duty in ridding our parish
of the 'vile miscreants, who have t
plundered our people and debased t
their official and their private pools. 1

comes the call for your assistance. -
Do not be east down at the arrest of ~

so ordained that great bodies of pas

rest-let them encareerate as in door u
geons; let them murder us, but do I
your duty, that of carrying the parish
agaisst all oeisisatiots. This display
of armed forces shall only serve to

"Our 'Judge" at Chattanooga.
IN SUITABLE POSITION AT LAST.
"FACTS" AND ,5TATISTICS" AR:E llI~
FORTE.
H. C. Myers the absconding Judge
of the 17th Judicial District, than
whom does not exist a more conlsu
mate thief and liar, is, we see fionm
the telegraphic dispatches, a dele
gate to the Convention of "congre.
gated Dick Turpins" at Chattanoog t.
Tennessee.
That settles the complexion of the
affair at once, and to the minds of the
people of Natchitoches, there can be
no more farcical thing than the fact of
Myers being upon the committee on
"Facts and Statistics," for he is with
out doubt the grandest liar that ever
existed, and would not be believed
on oath up here. However, he is the
"right man in the right place" now,
and if we do not have "raw-head and
bloody bones" in his report, then he
has forgotten his cunning.
Here are a few "facts" we ask the
people to consider in advance of "his
report-via: He is. a thief and a liar,
which we can prove by his own friends
-he stole all the school fund in this
parish for the last four years, amount
ing to theoussads of.dollars.
He is the originator of the Immigra
tion Bureau scheme, In which he at
tempted to mulch the parish out of
I9000--but was restrained- by order
of court, which he went so far as to
attempt to circumvent, and get the
monre ay wmy m he he sas judge him
sef.
He lied when he stated in his letters
to the New Orleans Republican, that
the Demoeraits ofNatcbitoebes par
ish were responsible for the enormous
8 per cent 'aues, when the facts were
patent to himself, that the Democratic
party had sot bsee i power ln the par
bh for sees yers, in which time all
this thkivig had occurred.
He lied when he said in the letter
referred to, that a mob had driven
him off from the bed side of his aged
and dytig father and his sick child.
He was likethe pgilty "who tiee when
no ,man persueth'-left here in the
dead hour of night a week before his
resigaatieo we to be demanded, and
no ioleaee was intended him, in proof
of whie nome was offered the other
Raddlcs, whoare oa spar with My
era; he deserted like a craven the
bed-side of his sick child-and like
the foul parenticide he abandoned his
aged and dying father to the mercy
of strangers, long before he departed
from Natchitoehes. His father was
fed and eared for by kind citizens
here for a long t me before he left,
and his brutal d ungrateful con
duet to the anther of his being, were
subjects of commest by all our citi
Isens. Let our jounas give ventila
I tion to this individual who is "get
ling up" statistlcs and facts as food
for the Northere demagogue, and per
Ihaps not so amuch coadence will be
!placed in what these villains put
forth as "fahcts."
