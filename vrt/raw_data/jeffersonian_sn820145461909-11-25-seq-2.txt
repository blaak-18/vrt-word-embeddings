The Field of Home Missions
By L. A. ODOM
Captain Salvation Army
(Reprinted from Watson’s Magazine for November.)
AVING engaged for a number of
years in home mission work, and
being in hearty sympathy with
H
your position on foreign mis
sions, I will take the liberty of giving
you some views and experiences as to
my service in this particular field, i. e.,
the field of home mission work.
I have read with the greatest interest
your reply in the September Jefferso
nian to Miss Janet Hay Houston, of
Monitor, W. Va. I wish to state that I
endorse unqualifiedly every phase and
feature of your position—which appears
to me as the only ground which a true
patriot can take.

This is the picture of a little girl who was res
cued from a half tumbled down negro shanty, and
who had been deserted by her mother. This child
is one among about forty-five children who have
been rescued from negro shanties, houses of ill
fame and other undesirable quarters in and around
Montgomery the past three years.
I note some woman over in West Vir
ginia is afraid that you will be de
voured by worms—suffer the fate of
Herod. Mr. Watson, it is simply fearful
to think of such things. It seems to me
that religious fanaticism is the wildest
and craziest thing beneath the stars of
heaven.
I have no special fear of reading in
the public press where the Sage of Thom
son has been smitten by the Angel of the
Lord and eaten by worms. However,
snould such unwelcome news be her
alded abroad in the land, I would shud
der to think what had been the fate of
some others if such a frightful visita
tion had been sent upon Thomas E.
Watson —great Southern commoner, pa
triot, unterrified defender of the right;
relentless foe of wickedness in high
places, and faithful friend to the desti
tute mothers and children of America;
friend to all who are in distress.

From dawn of time down to the pres
ent moment, the inspiration and integri
ty of all society has been based on love
of home, fireside and native land; the
burthen of the poet, the theme of the ora
tor, the study of the statesman, the
sweetest strain in national anthem, the
inspiration of the patriot, and the bul
wark of the republic.

This is the picture of one of the “ Old Guard ” of the
South, who tramps about over the land, getting what he
can. Is it better to take care of these old heroes than to
spend money on the saddle-colored, ungrateful and im
movable millions of China?
The achievements of the Confederate
soldier will shine with eternal lustre
in Valhalla’s hall because he poured out
his blood for God, for home and his na
tive land.
Would the name of Jefferson Davis be
uear to every true patriot if he had
spent his days trying to divert treasure
from the South in a vain and fanatical
endeavor to correct heathen customs in
China, Japan and other Oriental coun
tries ?
The Scriptural curse is upon him who
provides not for his own. But how about
depriving the needy of that with which
they have been provided?
These deluded women who are shed
ding crocodile tears over the constricted
feet of saffron-hued Orientals, and do
ing their wind-jamming about “Darkest
Africa,” I invite some of them to go with
me to some of the cities I have worked
in, and inspect the pale and despairing
features of some miserable mother
shackled by adversity—breathing the poi
sonous breath of wretched habitations;
with the rose gone from her once beau
tiful cheeks; with emaciated children
about her knee moaning for bread—and
let her stand up then and tell me that
we must maintain organizations to car-
SOCIALISM, by THOS. E. WATSON
“So then the existing
order,--social, political,
industrial and religious
—is to pass away. In the
new dispensation, under
Socialism, the restraints
give way to indulgence,
the strong hand of the
law is relaxed, the State
perishes, and religion
dies.”
TSfce Jeffersonian
I was born in the great State of Texas,
and of course all my sentiments are
Southern. I know there was no grander
patriot who ever buckled on the harness
of battle than the Confederate soldier; it
is very difficult to compute the value
of the Confederate soldier to Anglo-Saxon
supremacy and to white man’s govern
ment, and yet (it makes my heart sick to
relate it) I have taken these heroes of
the gray into my quarters, who have
tramped for miles over the country in
all kinds of weather, with bleeding feet,
weary hearts—tattered, torn and hun
gry; men who followed Forrest in the
whirlwind of battle; men who rode like
a cyclone behind the black plume of
Stuart driving Yankee invaders from the
soil of the old dominion.
Is it right? Is it just? Is it
humane ? —to send money out of this
country to Africa, India, Cuba, Mex
ico, etc., when the very men who saved
this Southland to posterity—in fact, I
claim, saved the republic (for were it
not for the South as a balance-wheel to
this government, the Great Jehovah him
self could only divine what would be the
fate of this republic)—are in desperate
want ?

ry treasure across the multitudinous
waves of the ocean to be expended in
the fruitless task of coercing our re
ligion into a people who were hoary
with age when this republic was first
born, and who are today the great
menace to the peace and safety of the
Western world.
I beg to take issue with Miss Houston
in her contention that foreign missions
furnish the life-blood of home missions.
The lady is sadly out of gear in her
statement; foreign missions is the vam
pire that is sapping and lapping the life
blood of home missions.
Miss Houston wants to know how you
would have felt standing among
the child widows of India, and
to have heard the wailing of the
footbound children of China.
I have never stood among the
“child widows of India” and I
pray that I may never as long
as there is a suffering destitute
widow left on our own shores.
I am not suffering from in
somnia on account of the “child
widows of India” —and will not
is long as we have so many wid
ows here at home right at our
doors—sick, suffering and desti
tute. I have picked them up on
the streets of cities -with ofttimes
as many as five and six small
children—hungry, cold, ragged;
destitute of funds and devoid of
friends, and heard from their
trembling lips an account of suf
fering which I feel sure, as com
pared with the “child widows of
India,” it might be said of the
latter that they were indeed
faring sumptuously.
“Licentious young man!
Listen to me! Put on
the brakes I Stop the
train! If you don’t
shackle those passions
of yours, and keep them
in chains, you are head

PROTESTS!
TEXAS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST
THOSE GALVESTON
RESOLUTIONS.
Dear Bro. Watson:—Enclosed, a
resolution passed by the Laneas
county union at the last meeting.
One of my friends was at the
meeting, and in conversation he in
formed me that the resolution endors
ing the passage of the Ship Subsidy
bill was introduced by Mr. Jackson,
member of the Texas Legislature
from Eastland county, also member of
the union. My friend gave it as his
opinion that the resolution was in
troduced at the close of the meeting
for a purpose, and that he was of
the opinion that it was not under
stood by the convention. Bro.
was on a committee, and was not in
the meeting at the time the resolu
tion was introduced and passed. J.
CID. BUFERD, OF THIS COUNTY
WAS ON THE RESOLUTION COM
MITTEE, AND HE IS SURE THAT
THE RESOLUTION DID NOT COME
BEFORE THAT CONVENTION AT
ANY TIME.
Respectfully,
JAS. W. BIARD.
503 S. 26th St.
Bro. Biard, by some inadvertence,
sent only the 2nd resolution; but his
letter and that part of the resolu
tions adopted tell the tale.
It is as follows—
2nd. That we very much regret the
action taken by the Galveston union
in recommending to our National
Congress the passage of infamous
Ship Subsidy bill.
JAS. W. BIARD, Chairman.
Ed. Comment: Just as I expected.
The Galveston Convention was fooled.
By cleverly avoiding the words Ship
subsidy, the Merchant Marine League
got in the thin edge of the w’edge.
The League is campaigning for the
Subsidy, and the Galveston resolu
tions were hailed with delight by the
League.
Those hightariff Republicans know
what they want —and they raised
yells of joy at the passage of the Gal
veston resolutions.
Those stand-pat Republicans, who
keep a tax of 165 per cent on the
poor man’s blankets—they know
what men are working with them;
aud they named Duckworth and Jack,
son!
