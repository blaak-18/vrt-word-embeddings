Summary of TA?ents as They Happen

Another Priestly Tune.
From Father Damien, who went
into voluntary banishment that he
might help those whom God had most
forsaken, the lepers of Molokai, to
the Rev. Father James B. Curry, of
New York, is a far cry —from the si
lence of a. lofty self-sacrifice to the
vicious outpourings of nasty vituper
ation. Father Damien did a form of
settlement work which, for extreme
self-iabnegation, can never be sur
passed. Father Curry fulminates
malodorously thus against the settle
ment workers of the misery filled
East Side:
“Fake philanthropists and a pseu
dohumanitarian priesthood with its
vestal virgins are making a parasiti
cal living from the muck they are
disturbing,” is another way he refers
to the workers.
“The female workers are irrepres
sible,” he says. “They seek out
children everywhere, at play, going
and returning from school, follow
them to their homes and drag them
into their clubs. The God-given in
stinct of maternal love is strong with
in them—so strong, indeed, that, hav
ing no children of their own upon
whom to lavish their love, they must
steal the children of others, of the
good Catholic And Jewish mothers in
the neighborhood.
“A May walk is delightful, but not
when a child whose appetite is made
keen by healthy exercise in the open
air is fed against the rules of his
church, the Catholic boy with meat
on Friday, and the Jewish child with
ham sandwiches. ’ ’
While the priest does not deny that
the two weeks’ vacation given tene
ment children under the care of the
settlement workers benefits them phy
sically, he says:
“The two weeks mean for every
child two weeks of apostacy, for the
child must attend the regular church
service provided by the workers, or
by the child’s summer guardians. I
understand just what two -weeks of
fresh air and green fields mean for
the tenementhouse child, but, consid
ering the price he must pay for it,
namely, a two weeks’ treachery to
faith, neither the ozone nor the grass
nor the abandon of two weeks is an
adequate compensation.”
God! That such a man should be
permitted to clothe himself in priest
ly robes and assume to preach and
teach his people! Better that these
hapless children suffer and sicken,
starve and die, than that their infant
minds should not be clogged with su
perstition, is his bigotdd doctrine.
Better that the “muck” the settle
ment workers have the courage to
disturb, be left year after year to
fester and reek and rot than that its
horror be brought to light, its woe
be relieved.
No band is perfect. Maybe there
are some mercenary settlement work
ers, but perhaps a few Catholic
priests could be found who care more
for the fleshpots than the communion.
But let that feature pass as unworthy
of discussion. However, it is certain
ly the height of supreme impudence
for ian exemplar of that religion
which exalts celibacy and vows its
thousands of men and women to a
grossly unnatural existence, to rail
at <a. few non-Catholic women who,
chancing to be childless, and not
heartless, take upon themselves the
wretched, The poor and inefficient
mothers in the slums to care for their
babes The screech of apostasy!
Heresy! andsoforth, does not chime
well with the music of 20th century
humanitarian progress, and harmony
would greatly be promoted if some
of this sort of blatant bigotry were
eliminated.
Baron Roquefeuil.
It took eight or nine years’ stren
uous research, they say, before it
could triumphantly be announced that
our own dear John I). Rockefeller,
“honest John,” some call him, had
real nobility spread thick on his es
cutcheon; not merely that anatomical
variety which springs from the head
and heart, but the true and royal
stuff of which kings and things are
made. The time involved in this her
aldic investigation is sufficient to pre
clude the suggestion that the title of
Parson was rebated, as it were, from
antiquity. Other magnates might
vulgarly purchase such embellish
ments, but not the sturdy Sunday
school scholar.
Baron Roquefeuil sounds mighty
good and a coat of arms, done in oil,
will appropriately cinch the entitle
ment.
“Who Laughs Last.”
The first Mrs. Ferdinand P. Earle
must smile a rather grim and bit
ter smile when she reads that the “af
finity” who supplanted her in the
affections of her husband has been
beaten by him and very naturally re
fuses to have anything more to do
with the “soul mate.” Choked, club
bed and slugged, too, at a time when
the new-born babe at her side would
have appealed to the most degener
ate ortdepraved. Those who like to
point morals will say, “I told you
so.” Yet this affair is quite beyond
the pale of rational prediction. Nev
er, perhaps, did a man exhibit such
cold-blooded and inordinate selfish
ness and egotism —yet ere the waning
of another moon, it would not be at
all surprising if one woman, or both,
did not return to compassionate him
for the hard time he had at the hor
rid old jail, where they jugged him
after the assault upon the mother of
his infant son.
Grammar students desiring a fine

It is leaking out that the charges
of Upton Sinclair, socialist author of
“The Jungle,” that the battleship
Oregon, and others of the United
States navy, have carried rotten arm
or plate for years, are correct.

His eightieth birthday finds Count
Tolstoy very weak and ill, but men
tally vigorous. With their inevitable
clumsiness, the Governors of Moscow,
Warsaw, Saratof, Simbrisk and other
provinces have resorted to martial
law to veto the celebrations arranged
by municipalities, and the 'St Peters
burg censorship has prohibited a me
morial performance in a local theatre.
In addition to this, the Holy Synod
has issued a circular enjoining all
believers not to take part in the dem
onstrations of love for this great Rus
sian, and it is said his grief over the
bitterness displayed is extreme.
His is the common lot of crucifix
ion—bodily or mental —inflicted up
on all patriots under a benighted gov
ernment.
It will interest fair managers and
exhibitors to learn of the clever fraud
which has been unearthed by Mrs.
Perry S. Young, of Oneonta, New
York, who discovered that jars of
supposedly preserved fruit and vege
tables were merely the fresh articles
in a thin syrup. She also found that
many “amateur” pictures were real
ly the work of professionals. These
schemes were started to get possess
ion of very considerable sums of pre
mium money offered at county fairs.
While this particular instance ap
plies only to New York, it is well
that the possibility of similar frauds
elsewhere be borne in mind, so that
honest competition be insured.
“James TC. Torasay, Taxpayer,” of
Cleveland, Ohio, has haled the city
of Cleveland, the Cleveland Ry. Co .
the Municipal Traction Co., its oiil
cers and directors, including “Tom”
Johnson, mayor, and the entire Coun
cil, into court, in an effort to beat the
famous three-cent fare issue. Os
course, it is apparent at a glance that
this “Taxpayer” is an entirely dis
interested party who is fighting the
Johnson policies from motives of the
purest patriotism. However the re
sult of the case will be interesting to
watch.
News has been brought byway of
Victoria, B. C., that about 600 Chi
nese, holding positions in the low
hills at each side of a gulley through
which 100 French troops had to pass
on their way to a village near Lang
vao, on the Tonkin border, ambushed
them and a sanguinary battle ensued.
The French captured the village
t wire, it being re-taken each time by
the Chinese. Capt. Fleury and Lieut.
Delattre were shot and then behead

The grand jury, working hard ovei*
the Springfield riots, has finally
placed the blame on “those members
of the police force, who, having taken
the oath of office, failed to do their
duty,” etc. And yet—and yet—
they’ll have some very quiet and re
spectful darkies in Springfield for
quite a> while hereafter. Which will
be some compensation.
J. Campbell Morgan, noted London
.preacher and admittedly best Bible
student in the world today, has just
reached New York, and declares un
equivocally in favor of woman suf

those who contend that women should
“keep silent in the churches” and
likewise have nothing to say any
where else.
Philadelphia now has a subway
similar to New York’s but its purpose
may be only to furnish a nice, dark
corner in which the sleepy citizen
of the Pennsylvania town may enjoy
a more undisturbed repose than he
could in the glare of the highway.

J. Hazen Hyde has been making
himself so offensive in China, by bull
dozing the Celestials at the hostel
ry which had the misfortune to re
ceive him as a guest, as to again re
call his vulgar personality to a world
which had wished and hoped to for
get him.
“Three Weeks” is dramatized, and
a real, live Russian actress, who is
also a princess, of course, is to star
in the play. Now let “Sappho” and
Salome” turn aside to blush.
A HAIR-RAISING TAIL.
✓
They were discussing the proper
way to bring up rabbits, when the
young man in the white canvas hat
with a light blue band threw away
his cigarette and remarked dreamily:
i 1 Speaking of raising hairs, when
I was up in Canada last year I heard
of a. hair tonic that was so marvellous
it made me somewhat sceptical.
Finally I borrowed some of it to
try on a tame jackrabbit that had
been rather out of sorts ever since
his tail got chopped off by accident.
I gave him some of it, and it sure
toned him up great—in fact, I,
reckon he’s running yet. But he left
the loose piece of his tail behind
him, and I says to myself: ‘lt’s a
s poor hair tonic that won’t grow hair.’
So I tried some of it on that chunk
of tail. Well, boys, you can believe
me or not, but as sure as my name is
Bates that stuff was so powerful that
it grew another hare on the tail in
nine and three-fifths seconds by my
watch. ’ ’
There was silence for forty-eight
seconds, and then the stout man in
the pink shirt and the pale-green tie
with purple dots spoke:
“That’s what you call a hair
raising tail,” he murmured in a
sudden burst of inspiration.—Judge.

took away I didn’t see how there
