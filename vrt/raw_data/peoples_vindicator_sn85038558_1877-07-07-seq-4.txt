RlwLIr T.\T COICI.USInS.--Slowly.
but reluctently, our relihance in the
prisent popilatuion of Lonisiana fit
securing permanenilt property to the
State is giving way to serious doulnts
and fears. While all intelligent mnen
in the State agree that a large in
e-rease of farmers and manufaceturers
is needed to secure prosperity, how
mluch time, nmoney an hbrain work
have our people employed since our
new State (;overnmtent has hald full
sway, to accompllish the desired ob
jectt iWe are still waiting for some
thing to turn up. We are lnever pIre
pated to begin a good work. To
morrow is thile appointed time, and to
morrow never comes. It is twelve
years since the war closed. Are we
any niore inclinled to work for the
State now than in 1865 i We think
not. There is less of pulblic spirit
now in Louisiana than there was
twelve years ago. If a live nmove
ment is made now a thousandil tonglles
remind tls of past defeats as a proof
that this, too, will be a failure.
The working friends of the State
are fast sinking under iaccnlnatlted
discouragemenlts. Thile wealthy con
tribute but little money, and the
most public spirited have no money
to give, to help forward a good cause.
Still there may be a change for the
better. Our people may becomie
alarmed at this death-like apathly,
and this torpor may not be the sleep
of death. But some of oar people
will never rally until the last trnm
pet sounds. As was once said of such
men by a celebrated orator, "they
have naught of life but the power to
siffer, and have all of death but the
silence of the grave.--N. 0. Picaqune.
