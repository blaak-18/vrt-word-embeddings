BOLIVAR
“Never raise monuments to a man
in his lifetime—he may change, he
may betray. You will never have to
charge me with this; but wait, I say
again; wait until after my death in or
der to judge me without prejudice,
and then accord me whatever honors
may be thought suitable.”
These modest words of Bolivar were
uttered in 1825, when the municipal
ity of Caracas proposed to erect a
monument to the honor of the Liber
ator. Fifty-eight years afterward
(July 24, 1883), his native city, Cara
cas, commenced a centenary celebra
tion of Bolivar’s birth, extending the
exercises throughout forty succeeding
days. Posterity had judged, him,
“without prejudice,” and had found
him worthy of great honors. Monu
ments have since been erected to him
in several cities, the state of Bolivia
was called after him, and everywhere
in progressive South America his name
is revered by his countrymen as Wash
ington’s is in the United States.
Bolivar’s case was another instance
of a high-born man of great wealth
deliberately staking all his advanta
ges to take pot luck with the com
mons.
Simon y Ponte Bolivar, called by
his countrymen El Libertador, was
born in the Venezuelan capital, Ca
racas, July 24, 1783, of noble parents.
He was in Paris during the closing
scenes of the French revolution, and
may have become infected with repub
lican ideas there —or perhaps he re
ceived them under the Stars and
Stripes while on a lengthy visit to the
United States in 1809. In any event,
in 1810 he unsheathed his sword as a
Colonel in a small revolutionary ar
my of Venezuelans, nobly joining it
at a time of defeat and despondency,
and for fifteen long years following
he was tempest tossed upon a sea of
war in which he rapidly rose to be,
not only commander-in-chief of the
revolutionary army, but the master
spirit of the entire movement.
Like his great prototype, Washing
ton, he lost battles and won the war;
but he had experiences peculiarly his
own. Three times hired assassins very
nearly accomplished his death; three
times he was driven from his country,
and three times he tendered his resig
nation of office.
Bolivar had much of the desperate
courage and ready inventiveness of
“1054 G. M. HEARD FROM.”

TOE WASHINGTON
of SOUTH AHEHICA
Caesar and Napoleon. In 1816, when
he renewed the struggle after a period
of exile in Hayti, he sailed for Ven
ezuela with seven small schooners,
three thousand muskets and three hun
dred men, and with these prepared to
assault a well-trained Spanish army.
He landed, and, like Cortez when he
invaded Mexico, Bolivar burnt his ves
sels behind him and invited death or
victory!
Or take another instance: In 1819
Bolivar conceived the bold strategy
of crossing the Cordilleras mountains
and attacking the Spanish in New
Granada. Poets, painters and histo
rians have dwelt much upon the story
of Bonaparte crossing the Alps, bnt
Bonaparte’s performance was com
monplace when compared with that
of Bolivar. Bonaparte had a veteran
army, accustomed to victory and with
abundant supplies; Bolivar had only
twenty-five hundred men, most of
whom were Spanish-Indian, half breed
llaneros, or cowboys. Fortunately,
however, his command mustered a bat
talion of English veterans, under the
brave Colonel Rooke, and a battalion
of fighting Irish, which included a son
of the famous Daniel O’Connell —and
the English and Irish got on well to
gether! Ilbw they mounted among
the everlasting snows, crossed turbu
lent, icy rivers on rawhide ropes; how
many died of starvation and cold, and
how at last a mere remnant of the
force descended into New Granada
and achieved victory make, together,
one of the most romantic stories of
military adventure in the annals of
mankind.
Bolivar had Napoleon’s gift of ring
ing address. His speech to his dis
couraged troops halting upon the sum
mit of the Cordilleras is a master
piece, and his address to his army in
1824 concluded w’ith these fine words:
“Soldiers! Peru and America ex
pect from you peace, the daughter of
victory! Liberal Europe beholds you
with delight, because the freedom of
the New World is the hope of man
kind. Will you disappoint it?”
Bolivar lived to hear the last gun
of the South American revolution, be
held his country started on a career
of peace and progress, and died qui
etly December 17, 1830, at his country
Home. In 1842 his remains were re
moved to his native city, Caracas, with
high pomp —and his monument went
