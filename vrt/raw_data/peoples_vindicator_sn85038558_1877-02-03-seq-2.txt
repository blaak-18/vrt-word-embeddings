Senator Conklin, of New York,
has done some things in life to
which we cannot assent, but his
effort, manly and able, in the
Electoral Bill debate stamps him
a man and a statesman far
above meaness. We are glad to
accord to the distinguished Sena
tor our congratulations upon his
position, and we can say truth.
fully, that as a whole, his speech
is one of the ablest ever delivered
in the Senate, and that is saying a
great deal.
The bloody-shirt gas bags are

and go to work in building up our
prostrate country. We have all
we can attend to in that, let us no

Because the present government of
North Carolina has refused to tax the
people to pay the worthless bonds

governments, the cry goes forth that
the "monied power" will destroy her

the part of Merchant millions. Those
debts represent the degradation ol
the tax-ptrayers of the South and were
all gigantic steals. North Carolina
does rightin refusing to re-imburse
the money hags fur outlay used in
degrading and robbing them. The
bond holders and the carpet-baggers
were in cahoot, let them both suffer.

Thy Servant Will Have Seen
Sufficient.
The PEOPLE of Louisiana need
not he surprised to hear at any no
ment of an nect of folly, nay-a crime
hbeing commit ted by their representa
tives at the Capitol of our State.
The rumors of Casey's election to
the Senate have reached us in a very
decided and trustworthy manner
and we are fuily satisfied that there
is more in this than we dream of.
A gentleman in whom we have
confitlence residling in the city of New
Orleans, has stated to us that Casey
would be elected to the United States
Senate by thie )crmocrats.
We ask in amazement, can such a
thing occur?
In all the political shlifting which
the leaders have snubjected the party
to in tihe past in this State; of all
the "trimminjngs, concessions, con
ciliations and compromise of princi
pie with fraud, this net of electing
Jim Casey by the Democratic housc
,old, certainly takes ground beyond
all that we have ever imagined. It
is a ldisgrace the party shall never he
subjected to withont our firm and
emphatic protest.
If the causu of Democracy in this
State rests in the consummation of its
political snccess, upon snch a founda
tion as all the world will say is dis
graceful, unmanly and dishonorable,
theln we have been all along mista
ken in Democracy, its traditions and
its principles.
Is this another attempt of the Bnz
zard to eat tihe prey of the Eagle T
Are the Conservative-Liberal nincom
poops coming forward after the bat
tle is won, to take the spoils and dic
tate places for their placemen.
We had thought the vigor and
manhood of Louisiana had throttled
those dead carcases that cling to the
chariot wheels of the party, on the
floor the Baton Rouge Convention,
but it seemsnot. Cat-like, they are
possessed of nine lives, and they
would add dishonor to the glorious
victory the whlite Democracy in a
canvass of reason and aggression,
have won over firaud and forco by
electing a creature who will reflect
naught but disgrace upon the State
and hier people.
We say to the Senator or Represen
tative who nimay have in contempla
tion this step to PIAUSE! and con
sider well his political future before
he makes it-for with that act hlie sui
cides--his grave is dug and the peo
pile will consign his person to eternal
oblivion, and his name to everlasting
dishonor.
No man that votes for Jim Casey
can ever hope to hold position in fu
ture by the suffrage of a virtuous
people. We beg of our Senator to do
no such thing.
We have been disgraced sufficiently
in the past by consorting with War
month and his gang to convince all
reasonable men that concession to
force and conniving at villainy are
not the ways of success.
Ratlher would we suffer ten Pack
ard's than such an ontrage as the elec
tion of Casey to the Senate of the
United States by the Democratic par
ty.
We have not seen in ten years,
nay, since 1861, such happy faces
as our people now wear.
Status Quo.
Elsewhere we succinctly state the
action taken by Judge Pierson, in
whwhll he is uIa(inious.ly sustatierd by
the people. with regard to the power
of his Court anod the respect dclue its
authority.
l)ispatches fiota the Governor. See
retary of State and Col. Levy., M. C.,
show that the President regards that
action as a violation of the statu.s quo.
In other words, the President says
that neither party shall advance un
til the question of the rightful an
thority in Louisiana is settled by ac
tion of ('ongres.s; that neither Iier
son nor lreda shall aoct further until
the said case is decided.
Judge P'ierson has slihmitted to the
wishes of (Governor Nichrolls and our
friends, and will adlainee no further
in tlhe matter, althonugh he as well as
we repudiate the aunthority or power
of either the Governor or President
to interfere in ;. par.ly .judicial mat
ter. Be that as it may, however, we
are satistied 'ith the result of the
advance. We hece felt the enemies
linesb. tni.1 now' ea ttlj their position.
The stability and purity of the
Nicholls Government dofes not dle
1pe!d ipan tlhe doubtr, ful recognition of;
its anthiority by the elected l:alical
oflicials throuoglinut the State. That
class wiil incoginiize decency anti vir
tue when there i. no other way to
help it than stppinug down and out.
We have all along doubted thisi death
bed repent)ance, for we were aware
that the character of the local Radi
cal was totally opposite to a display
of virtnue-unless neces-ity compelled
theim to it. We know now that no
Hill en here w ill recognize Nicholls,
it' he can help it. That they will
cling to Packard to the 'ast gasp, and
when there is no possihility of his
snucceeding, then they will he loud in
their lovalty to Nicholls. When that
g;aiiei is at mpitedr in Natchitoches
parish it will not win; for the skir
mish just had and the stat tu quo dis
turbance has firuly tixeed the status
of every otlicial in this parish, a s1ta
tI.s they will lie compeled to maiintai:
to the edrl, win who may.
Repudiating the authority of
Nicholls now ; refusing to recognize
its lawful officers to-day, shall hold
good for all time. We presented the
opportunity for them to display their
hands; for them to elect under which
King they would serve, anl they hare
done so I
With Nicholls and his Government:
its success and legality we have em
barked our all. Our boats are des
troyed and there is no retreat. We
have proclaimed himn ruler or that
he must be snpplanted by one more
powerful physically-and that one
must govern directly.
These men inhave elected otherwise ;
they have decided tn 'east their lots
with Packardl; with himn they must
now lose either way. Hle can never
sucnceed ; that fact is settled! It will
be Nicholls or a Military Government,
and with either, the local Radicals of
Natchitoches must make up their
minds to step down and out.
They may laugh nod jeer at what
they supposed "sharp practice," but
when they read this, then we defy
them to call np even a smile. The
I"sharp practice" was a l one way,
ye grinning idiots.
Senator Elam.
We sincerely hope our friends of
the Mansfield Ieporter have not cor
rectly stated Mr. Elam's views upon
the question ot contesting the seat in
the Senate now unlawfally occupied
by M. }?. Twitchell. We would be
pained to think that Mr. Elam "had
left the matter entirely in the hands
of the Democratic Senators, and if
they think hlie should contest, he is
ready." It wonld pain us beyond
measure to suppose for an instant that
Mr. Elamn would so far forget who
were the masters and who the ser
vents in this matter.
The Democratic Senators have no
more to do with the question of
whether Mir. Elam should or should
unot contest than the King of naho
mey. Mr. Elam does not represent
the "Democratic Senators who have
a quornm in the Senate," but he rep
resents the peopl of the 22d Senatorial
District, and their wishes should alone
be consulted upon the question of
contemng or not contesting. The
people of this District demand of Mr.
Elam that he move in the matter at
once.
If he does not wish the honor of
representing this District in the Sen
ate, let him then tender his resigna
tion as a Senator, for such he is as
all the world knows, and let us have
a new election that we may have a
gentleman and a man of honor repre
senting the District, instead of the
infamous Twitchell. We are ready
and have been to defend Mr. Elam
from the charge of "crookedness" in
the compromise of 1874; but at the
same time we insist that hlie shall give
the lie, emphatically and at once to
these charges, by insisting upon the
rightsa of the majority of the people
of this District in demanding repre
sentation through him in the State
Senate.
That is the question in a nut shell,
and hair splitting will not do.

ObStructing the Status Quo.
It scents that toe anltion taken last
week by Jnleo P'ierson, which was
legal and propelwr, has been mi-u ler
stood by our fricnds in New Orleans,
else they areo acting nplon tfhe state
ments of the partizarns of the radical
paity of tlis place f'urnlished no
doubt to Packard.
The whole matter amonts to this :
Jnudl Pierson took the o:iith of office
on Saturday, Jan nary 20th, before
clerk Barlow. O(n Monday parties
sued out a warrant for the arrest of a
criminal before him, whereupon he
ordered the shirifl, Barron, to ex
ecute it. This Barron refused to do ;
then Judge P'ierson sIspenllded him
by written order and called in person
upon the Coroner, Breda, a brother
to the Retui'rnilg Board judge, who
also refused to recognize the corn
mnisSion of Governor Nicholls under
which Jludge Pielrson was acting
then lBrdal was also suspentled and
t31. L. lates. a constable, was ap
pointed sheriiff, as the law requires,
1who are'c bond and executed the war
rant.
The elerk, a Republiea:n, promptly
recognized JOdge Pierso1n and the
fnaper's reciting action in the case
were forwarded by Judge Pierson to
the General Assembily, which alnie
hat.' aulhoril/ to taike covji1an ce of the
conduct of judicirl officers, for their
action.
Only this and nothing more was
done, wherenipon the falitlifnl (liars)
set up a howl of ''obllstr ttilg and
distiirbing the statl qulo." Ezernaok,
president of the Police Jury, irefused(
to approve the bond of Mr. Bates and
Jud ge Pierson ruled him lo shoiw ca.use
why he shonuhl not; answer was re
turned hby Ezernack which not Ieir,q
suflicient in law was overruled anil
the bond of Bates st11nrls approcd by
order of Court.
No obstruction has been presented
to those elected upon the Republlican
ticket in this parish fromi qnalifying,
wheree they have been elected. Breda
was never elected judge, and the fact
is well known by every radical here.
The bonds presented by those officials
who wishcd to qualify have so far been
pe;fectly wrorthlcs, and the Recorder
has relused to givq oficial sanction
to them for that reason, and that rea
son alone.
The management of the' domestic
affair, of this parish will be looked
after by its citizens closely in future,
becaunse we were the unfortnnate 8
per cent taxed a few years ago ; and
no man is expected to so far stultify
himself as to approve a bond known I
by himiself and every one in the par
ish to be worthless. Such official
conduct was indulged in by radicals
before, and is now, for the president 1
of the Police Jury has approved themn I
all, and we defy himi to prove before
a comlpetent court that a single man
on either boid as approred by him is
wotlh one dollar.
It insisting upon good and solvent
seocirity on the part of officials for
the faithful performance of their dnty
is "obslructing." then we pIlead guilty i
but until these officials do presenti
honolsmen that are worth what they
say they are under oath, "obstruct
ing" will go on.
We are happy to add for the benefit
of our city friends that she "statn
qo," that bugbear, has not broke
loose up Red River,.

WASHINGTON.
Washington, January 24. - The
electoral bill passed by a vote of 191
to 86.
The reportod interview between
the President and Senator Perry re
garding the pending bill, published
this morning, is bogus.
THE DEBATE IN THE HOUSE.
The House debate to-day on the
compromise electoral bill lasted from
10 in the morning until five in the
evening. It did not abate in in
terest during the whole seven hours
and from the opening until the ad
journment of the session the galleries
were crowded and many visitors werec
admitted to the floor.
The speeches against the bill were
made by Messrs. Knott, Blackburn
and Jones of Kentucky, Mills of Tex
as, and Singleton and Lynch of Mis
sissippi; while Brown of Kentucky
and Hill of Georgia, made earnest,
patriotic and eloquent appeals for its
passage.
The two latter speeches were en
thusii:.ticallV applauded, and it was
a mtla1bl, (ircumitanco that ,just as
I Mr. Hill concldled his peroration, a
telegram was put into his handi an
noncning his election as a Senator.
The Speakei Randall exercised his
constitutional privilege of vit ing as a
IRepresentativew from Pennsylvania,
and gave his vote in favor of lit:e hill,
The vote oil its pass;~age was yeas 191:
nays ;---al1 but 18 of the negative
votes were given by the Republicans,
among the I4 were the follow ing:
Blacklburn, Durham, Jones, Knott
and Millikin, of New York ; Bradford.
C:hlwell, Fornev and W\illiamns, of
Alabamna ; Mills, of Texas ; Singleton
of Mississippi, and Smith, of Georgia.
The bill now goes to the President.
The Conference of Powers having
submitted. through their represent
atives, a programme for adjiiiting the
dillic;,lties between Russia and Tu'r
key, and that programme having
bean rejected by the latter the war
seems now on the verge of breaking
out.
Russia agreed to reduce her de
inands to a. minimum ; henceforth RuI
sla thinks herself entitled to reckon
on the continued collective efforts of
Europe whose accord for common
ulterior action has not been destroy
ed by the conelusion of the confer
ence. The memorandum concludes
by stating that Russia proposes short
ly to suhmit a programme to which
she hopes to obtain the adhesion of
the powers.
The plenipotentiaries who were de
tained at C'onstantinoplo after the

Liverpool, Jan. 2(;.-Tho circular
of the Liverpool Cotton Brokers' As
sociation says : Cotton became an
imnted last Friday afternoon, and a
large business was done on Saturday,
with a considerable advance in price.
Business since Monday has been com
paratively moderate at rates favor
ing buyers, but quotations of most
descr iptions are still above last week's.
America was in very large demand on
t'riday and Saturday, and p rices ad
vanced 3-16d. There has since been
less doing, and with a free supply 1
10 of the advance has been lost. Sea
Island has been in improved inquiry
at firm prices. In futures transac
tions have been extensive at advane
ed rates, but business since Monday
has been limited at lower prices.
The opponents of Nicholls are urg
ing that from the political proclevi
ties of somne of his appointments the
ultra element of the Demnocratic-Con
servative party will dominate.
Nicholls' friends deny this, and
cite the appointment of Penn as evi
dence that such statements are un
true. Leading Democrats here will
advise Nicholls that upon this mnay
turn the recognition of hs govern
ment and that glreat care is necessa
ry in making appointments, which
shall not give color to Republican
statements.
We clip the above firom the New
Orleans Times special telegrams of
2Lthl January. It is in the same old
stra', of conciliation, concession and
comprclise, which the "disinterest
ed patriots, in Louisiana consider as
the acmo ot 'olitical science. The
"ultra-Denmocras,, who are supposed c
to be the "simon-lre," are a thorn e
in the side of the she. tongue Con
servatives, and thie fear , always ex- I1
pressed that they "will ,minate.',
Governor Nicholls was the 'nminee
of the simon-pure, "ultra Do-"
crats," and his administration of t..,
government of this State will be
Democratic to the core. That the
special telegrapher and Iris friends,
can he assured of.
What is Conservatism in Louisi
ana The question is easily an
swered-it is a feeling that actuates a
certain class of would be public ser
vants, to turn first one way and then
the other in order to drop on which
ever side may wcin. They are men
without opinions, utterly devoid
of principle, who have never been
loud enough in their denuncia
tion of Radical rascality in Loaisi
aua to effect their standing with the
Radical party. An official thiet is to
them an unfortunate individual, and
elicits most profound sympathy for
having "erred." The villainies, slan*
ders and outrages inflicted upon the
white race of Louisiana does not ef
fect this class of milk-sops with any
great amount of sympathy, and they
go about whinng of the "forms of
law" and "peace at all hazards," till
honest men become sick and disgust
ed with them.
To suppose for an instant that Gov
ernor Nicholls would rally to his sop
port such a class as this hungry horde,
is to suppose that Governor Nicholls
is a raformer on paper.
This State was won-victory was
achieved by one class alone-the
simon-pure idtra Democrats. The
battle began with John MeEnery in
1872, after submitting for six years
to the imbecile leader-ship of this
same coterie of eminent Conserva
tives, and that battle was ended by
victory in 1876. The ultra Demo
crats not only fought the enemy,
powerful as they were, but they were
compelled to drag through all those
dark and bloody days the dead
weight of Conservatism which bred

The following are the points in the
Electoral Bill which are tersely stated
and stripped of useless verbiageso
that all can undlerstand them:
i. Those States of the Union which
pres;int but one Electoral return or
certiticate are to be counted, unless
both 1ouses reject them. 2 The
I States with twV returns conflicting
with each other are referred to aCoa
mis:;ioa, which has all the executive
power and authority of the two
3 Houses, either together or separately,
3. These powers are not definedby
the bi.ll, and present the features in
the following way :
A. The two Houses of Congress
Smeet to count the vote Thursday,
February 1st.
B. There will be four tellers, two
elected rica voce by each House. This
u allow of a caucus of each dominant
party, nominations, and a strict par.
ty r epresentation from each House.
There will be five Democratic Be.
presentatives from the Lower House,
live Republican Senators.
C. One Senator and one Member
miet object to the vote of each State
where there is no opposing certifl.
cate, and afterward both Houses must
separately withdraw and one or hoth
resolve not to count that certificate.
So Mississippi will be counted for
Tilden. Arguments are not permit.
ted in the Grand Convention.
1). Confi;cting certificates only shall
go to the Mixed Tribunal. That Tri
bunal can not be dissolved by either
House. By the death or prostration
of a member it can he renewed by a
rica roce vote of the House where the
member sits. So with a dying Just
ice the other four select a fifth again;
E. When they retire to debate, the
two Houses shall have at the utmost
only two hours on each case oVa\sa
pnted certificate of State.
F. When the triple Tribunalde
ciuhes, both HIouses must dissent to
overthrow the decision. One Hlouse
is not enough.
G. A single joint meeting of the
two Houses will determine who is
President after the Commission de
cides. Thus, if there be four disputed
States, the whole debate will take
only eight hours. Meeting at one
o'clock it will be ten p. m. before the
great result is known. But there
may be a recess until the following
day, in each case of the House with
draw ing.
