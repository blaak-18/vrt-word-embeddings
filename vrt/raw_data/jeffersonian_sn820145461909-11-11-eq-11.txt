OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Out of the many letters which we
received, correcting the mistakes in
the letter of little Mary Stanley, not
a single one caught every error.
Nearly all found out that Athens was
in North Georgia, and three and three
made six instead of five. The mis
takes in spelling were well corrected,
but many left the “e” in judgment,
One of the most fruitful sources of
error is the faulty use of “shall” and
“will,” and few of our members
caught this point. “I am twelve
year old next week” was corrected
to read “I will be,” instead of “I
shall be,” and was followed invaria
bly by “will hope,” instead of “hope.”
The correctness of “like it fine” and
“feeling good” was hardly questioned.
Both phrases are wrong. Some did
not even find the right letter. Oth
ers made excellent improvements in
the wording and construction of the
letter. Taken all in all, the best cor
rection was received from Melvin El
lington, a boy fourteen years old, liv
ing at Oxford, Ga., and he will win
the first prize. Next came Miss Clo
vie Gilstrap, ten years old, Pickens,
S. C. The third prize will go to Miss
Martha Webb, twelve years old, R.
F. D. 1, Kenton, Tenn.
THE LETTER CORRECTED.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I am a little
girl, and live on a farm near Athens,
a pretty little town in North Geor
gia. We have a nice house and gar
den. I have two sisters and three
brothers, six of us in all. I shall
be twelve years old next week. I
was sick this summer, but am feeling
well now. All our neighbors take
The Jeffersonian, and like it very
much. In my judgment, it is the best
paper I have ever seen. I shall be
glad to win one of the prizes that
you offer, and hope to hear from you
through the paper.—Your little
friend, Mary Stanley, Athens, Ga.
THE HONOR LIST.
Other letters, which showed every
evidence of great pains and care,
were received from Miss Alpha El
lerbee, Crest, Ga.; Miss Rebecca
Lindsey, Forsyth, Ga.; Miss Effie D.
Bryant, Dawson, Ga.; Aliss Maude
Poole, Cordele, Ga.; Robert Corn
well, Ty Ty, Ga.; Miss Ethel Lewis,
R. F. D. 4, Cairo, Ga.; Miss Gertrude
White, R. F. D. 4, Collinsville, Ala.;
Miss Ista Durham, Jefferson, Ga.;
Jesse P. Browne, Dearing, Ga. A
good letter was received from Syca
more, Ga., but it was unsigned.
AN ARKANSAS GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here comes a
little Arkansas girl to join your happy
band. Papa takes The Jeffersonian
and I like to read it very much. I
am twelve years old and weigh one
hundred and. twenty-two pounds. I
just love to go to school, and I am in
the sixth grade. Our school will
start the first Monday in November.
Oh, how glad I will be. Well, as this
is the first time I have written, I
guess I had better describe myself.
I have a fair complexion, blue eyes,
and brown hair. Emma Matthews,
TJeffersonlan
I like your letter fine. We have
some mean boys around here, too,
but they are not all mean. I will be
thirteen years old in February. Dad
dy Jim, I would send your
but I can’t draw good pictures and I
am afraid you would laugh at it, so
I will not send it. We live in the
country and my father is a farmer.
Hoping to see this in print, I remain,
with best wishes to The Jeffersonian,
Willie Gentry, R. F. D. 1, Slocomb,
Ark.
SOME RIDDLES.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Hey, how are
you boys and girls? Hope you are
enjoying yourselves these cold days.
I am at our store this morning and
am almost frozen. I do not get
very lonesome. There arc several
little children that come and stay
with me every day. There are two
little boys here with me now. They
are my little cousins, Horace and
Theo Davis. I haven’t picked any
cotton this year. Have you all? I
will tell you some riddles: What is
that which goes up the hill and
down the hill and yet stands still?
The road. What is that which is
black, white and read all over, which
shows some people to be green and
makes others look blue? A newspa
per. What becomes of the chocolate
cake when your only son eats it? It
vanishes into the empty heir (air). —

A FARMER’S DAUGHTER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —As I saw my
other letter in print, I thought I
would write again. I received my
paper and was glad to get it. I sure
do like to read your paper. lam a
farmer’s daughter and live in the
country. I spent this summer in the
city, but I like country life best.
Well, Christmas will soon be here.
The old year will soon be gone. How
many of us can look back over this
year and see what good we have ac
complished? When the old year has
gone and the holidays are past, may
we all go back to our work with
more willing hearts to do more in
the future than we have in the past.
Guess I had better quit, ere Daddy
Jim will think lam preaching. Say,
how many of you all are about
through with your work? We w r ill
soon be through, as our crops are the
shortest in this section they have
ever been before. Well, I will tell
you all what I do. I work in the
field and help mamma and sister in
the house. I have one sister at home
older than myself and three younger
than I; also one brother. I guess
1 had better ring off or I may get
in the waste-basket. Wishing The
Jeffersonian great success, I will say
good by.—Your niece and cousin,
Florence Smith, Walnut Grove, Ala.,
Route 2.
WHAT THE DICTIONARY SAID.
“You have a model husband,” said the
lady who was congratulating the bride.
The next day the bride noticed the
word “model” in the dictionary, and this
is what she found:

thing.”—Cassell’s 4/ agazine.

Pain in
Heart
“For two years I had pain in
my heart, back and* left side.
Could not draw a deep breath
or lie on left side, and any little
exertion would cause palpita
tion. Under advice I took
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy and
Nervine. I took about thirteen
bottles, am in better health than
I ever was, and have gained 14
pounds.”
MRS. LILLIE THOMAS,
Upper Sandusky, Ohio.
For many years Dr. Miles’
Heart Remedy has been very
successful in the treatment of
heart troubles, because of its
tonic effect upon the heart
nerves and muscles. Even in
severe cases of long standing it
has frequently prolonged life for
many years after doctors had
given up all hope, as proven by
thousands of letters we have re
ceived from grateful people.
Dr. Mlles’ Heart Remedy Is sold by all
druggists. if the first bottle fails to
benefit, your druggist will return your
money.
