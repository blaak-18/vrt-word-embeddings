Our grandmothiera vied with one an
other in the weaving of woolen counter
panes. generally in white and indigo
blue. They were of such workman

down from one generation to another,
they are as fresh, strong and handsome
as when new. The-modern patchwork
quilt is not more varied as to patterm
than were these aocieot counterpanes,

out strange designs of trees, flowers,

pattern was a geometrical one, and the
fidelity to good drawing exbibited by
these homely artista is astonishing. As
In old fashioned samplers, the worker
was apt to show a pardonable pride

Today these quaint counterpanes are
being resurrected from cedar chests,

favorite method is to hang them as
portieres in a room wbere old fasblhion

ed on a wall bebhind a stiff old sofa,
draped over a four post bed or spread
on a round table. Sometimes, if the
room la not subjected to the hardest
wear, they are laid as rugs on a pol
ished or painted floor. They make a
picturesque draping for a low couch or
divan, spread as a bagdad is, and one
sees them occastonally on a brass (.r
white enameled bed, with the super
fluous length (for our grandmothers

[Special Corre~pondence.1
NEW YORK. Dec. 17.-The richest
girl in the world is going to he mar
ried in the early part of the year. and
so are mniany other girls not qnite so
rich, and it is fair to expect that they
will all be equally h:ippy-or wretehed,
as the caste maiy lie-after the lirst
glamour is past- But tihe making of
dear little plans atouit ihe wedding
outfit is just as absorbing for one asit
is for the otlher. The wedding lress is
just as full of meaning for one as it
Is for the other, and so let us see
wherein ene bride is h.!ppier than
another. If there is any differcnce. it
is because one can have a point lace
veil and the other must put tip with
a simuiple tulle one. Miss Alta Rocke
feller can have a veil made out of
somie old papal piece of preclous point
which has co-st no one knows how
many years of toil at the bottom of a
cellar-for thitis knlud of lace cannot
be made anywhere except in a damp
cellar, for fi'ear that the threads would
beconie dry and brittle. And no one
could s 'y how many cases of con
suniption and blindness were wrought
into tie point laice veil, but one costs
almost enough to build a hospital for
the blind or to establish a sanitarium
for consuniptives. And It is funny,
lut a point veil is not half so pretty
or becoming as the lighter and less
costly onie.
Miss IRokefeller is said to be a noblc
and simnple hearted girl and worthy ol
all the good gifts that I'rovidence has
in store for a good woman, and chief
est of these is a good husband. And 11
is to hier credit that she has chosen v

to talk of the subject when one onl3
grows angry ahout it all and cannot d<
any good? Only I may say this, and li

mgore than of her own vahity. No one
knows who has not seen this done how
artfully It is worked, and we often
wonder how such or such a' girl ever
married the impecunlous nobleman she
did. The syndicate furnishes the man
with money to make an appearance.
and in some cases they have put up
large sums of money to make it appear
that the marriage was one of love pure
and simple. The unfortunate girl will
find out soon enough.

NEW FLOWER FASHION5.
Cwm Bo~quet and L'Algtlo Collar of
thbe Swell Society Girl.
Every bride wants her wedding to he
different from the other girls' in deco
rations and bouquest. She would like
them altogether new. but by nmodlifica
tlons and a few chauges to suit the re
quireieniits an ortginal effect may he
obtatned that is at once charniug and
elegant. In view of this. the followlng,
amung a number of fashions and fan
ieds noted in the New York IlH-ralJd,. are
very taking:
Bridal houquets of lies of the ý-lley
and white orchids are qiuite tbe smart
eet cornhination. They are either round
or the pnlume sliape and may hbe
showered or not. accurding to prn-fr
ence. The h'ight of the hride and her
maids le an important item for the
florist to know, for houquets are btuilt
differently for tall and for short maids.
Flowers of color are oftenest used for
the bridesmniads, red andi white roses
for brunettes, white and pink for
blonds, and the mnid of honor carries
a bunch all of a solidl eolor.
The effect may be entirely spolled by
the awkward way the flowers are held.
The round bouquet should be carrTled
in hoth hands, while the plunme should
be laid wracefully across the left arm,
the steiis being held with the right
han. Iltonquets are made up with
special regard to the style and color of
the gewns. The very sniartest thing
now is to shower the bridesmails' honu
quets. using pink and white ludt for
thesv and rich red Jak.s for the maid
of honor's. All thlie bonquets are tied
witih iro.iad velvet ribbons to match the
predotuinating color.
All the flowers for the wedding party
are furnished by the grooin.m, according
Sto the directions of the flancee.
A bud or two from the bridal plume
r make the groom's bontonniere. The
best man wears a flower from the maid

ef bonor's bouquet. and the ushers
w~r gardenlas or appear adorned with
the dame kind of flowers that the
bridemmalds carry.
A new and very pretty idea is to
tasten the souvenirs the bfride bestows
upon her malds In the knots of ribbon
and flowers of the bouquets. Often It
is a pin of the mald's favorite stone.
The custom of presenting the brides
malds with their gowus is followed by
morpe. brides.
The Mttle maid of honor, usually the
small sister of the bride, carries on her
arm a basket of inarguerites. The
page. whose duty It Is to carry the brid
al train and keep bis eyes fastened on
the head of the stately bride, wears a
boutonniere on his little velvet coat or
blouse with quite the same air of dis
tinction as the best man.
Two novelties in flower fasbhlons thil
season are the cuff bouquet and L'Al
glon collar. The society girl who can't
exist without her violets and who finds
the huge round bunch charming for the
street, but Inconvenient for evening
wear, will gleefully welcome this orig
Inal idea. for it will enable her to dcling
to her cherished Marie Loulse and yet
reign in comfort.
The cuff bouquet is decidedly new
and practical, for It is worn on the arm
and does not bamper the éiands. It is
made of broad iatin ribbon, which fas
tens around the riglit wrist. From this
depend a bow and streamers of the
ribbon outlined with violets. A small
rope of violets swings trom the wrist.
Tied in witli the knot on the cuff is a
buncb of the same flowers and ferns.
One of these cuff bouquets made up
with lliles of the valley or all gardenlas
is particularly smart.
The new collar called L'Alglon, in
honor of Maude Adams.and her imper
sonation. is also of the favorite violet
The brAd band which encircies the
throat is thickly covered with the flow
ers, and from the sides are epaulets of
the same. Narrow violet ribbons are
woven in latticework across the front
and hang in long ends to the edge of
the skirt.
The Alglon Collar.
We may have high or turndown col
lar. The Alglon recommends itseif
from the fact that it has a deep band
round the throat and turns down in a
rounded form from this and Is not at
all unbecoming. It owes its name to
one of Mme. Bernhardt's many tri
