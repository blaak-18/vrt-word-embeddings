Colombia Accuse, l'resident Castro of
Furthering Secretly the Revolu
tion Against That ('ountry
s0 by Smuggling of Arms.
Port an Spain, Aug. 3.-Venezuela is
again on the eve of a revolution and se
rious complications will, in all proba
bllity, arise between the governments
of Venezuela and Colombia. President
Castro, while facing the uprising against
his own authority, is also accused of
furthering secretly the revolution
against the Colombian government.
Arms, ammunition and other accesso
ries ,,f war have been quietly smuggled
into Venezuela through the waterways
of the republic, and the first engage
ment is expected to be a signal for tile
uprisings in several widely separated
districts.
General Castro is expected to assert
his power by placing strict censorship
on all telegraphic dispatches from that
country as well as ordering close scru
tiny of all mail matter passing through
the general postofice in Caracas.
To add to the seriousness of the situa
tion in Venezuela itself it is well known
in the adjoining republic of Colombia
that a very strong feeling of resentment
against the Oastro government exists
on account of what is considered a seri
ona breach of international law on the
part of Venezuela, for its alleged reoog
aition, if not actual assistance to the
leaders of the revolutionary party of
Colombia.

in the afternoon there is an opportu
nity to entertain frienls with a cup of
tea or an ilec. Tihe piazza is really only
another room, and it it extends aroundl
the house there is always a place
screened from the rays of the sun.
The cheap chotton Japanese rugs, even
those that have don first servie r with
in doors, are appropriate for a floor
covering. Indeed. a strip of matting
Is preferred by some women to the cot

light oak rockers known as piazza
chairs and need not be taken in at
night, for even if a shower give them
a good wetting there is no harm done.
A couch of cane is less expensive than
a rattan couch and Is almost as pretty.
Over this rugs may be thrown and pil
lows piled up at the hack.
A kitchen table, the legs of which
have beeDn shortened and over the topl
of which a denim table cover has been
thrown, is convenient for books and
magazines. The Japanese screens or
shades that hang at the front and sides
of piazzas are inexpensive, easily low
ered and raised and by many preferred

A hammock, which is the usual fea
ture of piazza comfort, is often more
pleasing to look at than to lie In and
for that reason is not so popular as it
once was. If there is a secluded cor

good, but It no longer monopolizes
space that can be more satisfactorily
filled. The large willow steamer chair.
which Is really a couch. is far more
comfortable. It may be filled with
pillows at the reclining back or not.
It Is a comfortable summer chair acd
far ahead of a hammock.
For the hammock the pillows should
be linen covered or gingham covered,
so that the slips can be washed every
week or two, for they are bound to
catch the dust.'
A very attractive piece consists of a
cross between a steamer clair and a
hammock. The canvas is swung in an
enormous woollen framework, and
when the hammock chair is filled with
pillows it Is to be recomlmended for a

the piazza.
The woman who knows how best to
enjoy the summer at home has dessert
served out on the piazza after dinner.
The little tables are spread with tray
cloths, and the coffee and fruit and an
ice are waiting there when the family
adjourns from the dinner table. Then.
also, the gentlemen can enjoy their
after dinner cigars. Such little touches
as these do so much to lend spice to
and to dispel monotony from home
living.
