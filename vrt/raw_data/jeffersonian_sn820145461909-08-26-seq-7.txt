for the present, I am unable to make
dates for lectures and addresses.
It is hardly necessary for me to
say how deeply these invitations are
appreciated. If there were two of
me, one would stay in-doors and
write, while the other stayed out
making speeches. In that case, we’d
have a few old politicians going

Summary of Events as
They Happen
some distrust and misgiving as to the
entire national banking evil, and the
proposition to make it worse will not
be met with acclaim.
There is only one reassuring fact
in connection with the famous “Mon
etary Commission’’ and that is, it is
so hopelessly besmirched by Aldrich’s
presence that any plan it makes may
meet defeat. If Aldrich were in
spired by the purest motives now,
his record is such that no other im
portant work is apt to succeed in his
hands. He should be content with
having served the corporations well
in the tariff mess, and retire upon
his laurels—and other more substan
tial things so faithful a menial should
receive from his bosses. And as for
seriously crediting Aldrich with a
pure motive—it would argue lack of
common intelligence on the part of
the creditor.
Bronze statues of George Washing
ton and Robert E. Lee have been
placed in the “Hall
Virginia’s of Fame’’ at the na-
Contribution. tional capitol and
will be unveiled, with
appropriate ceremonies, within a

Sorrowful Indianapolis has had
cause sto rue the automobile races
which inaugurated its
Death on the great motor speed-
Speedway. way. Seven killed,
and a number in
jured, is the heavy sacrifice made to
the craze of the automaniacs for
driving their machines at terrific
pressure. What a pity it is that the
tyrants of ancient Rome did not
know the savage delight of mangling
by this method; they could have
added so much ecstacy to their rou
tine sports. Merely by ordering one
of these races on the programme
they could have insured the neces
sary brutalities for the occasion, with
the delicious uncertainty as to the
victims, and whether they would
have their brains dashed out, or be
ground to pulp under the wreckage,
or even be burned alive by flaming
gasoline. The tedium of planning
monotonous tragedies, and the weari
ness of seeing the same old kind of
holocaust all the time would have
been spared the estimable emperors
could they have sent their gladiators
blithely “bubbling” forth to win a
cup.
