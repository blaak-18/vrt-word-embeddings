8©w They Drop Shot
A reporter of the Baltimore A men
can tlilift describes one of the ruiiuy
processes of making sliot in one of
the 8lio|*toweiB of tlint city : One
of the ^secrets'' of the manufacture
is the nixing of the lead with n cer
tain proposition of a combination of
mineral ^substances called temper."
The temper is fused with the lead,
iind gives the molten metal that con
sistency which makes it drop, and
without which the lead would be
moulded by tli« siev«*, and would
form li'tle pencils instead of round
shot. When " BB " shot, for in
stance, are to be made, the lead is
poured into n pan perforated with
litles corresponding to that size.
The little pellets come pining down
in a continuous shower, und fall into
il tank filled with water oil the ground
floor. In their descent nf two hnn
dred feet they become perfect spheres
firm and dense, w&l they are toler
ably cool when they stiike the water,
iilthongh the swift conciliions m;ike
the tank foam and bubble as if the
waten was boiling furiously. The
shot must fall in the water, for if
they would strike any firm substance
they would be flattened and knocked
out öf shape. To get the little pel
lets perfectly dry after they have
been in.the " well," is the most diffi
cult and troublesome process of the
whole . manufacture. An elevator
with saiiall buckets (very much like
those H8< d in Hou r mills) carries the
shot up as fast as th-»y reach the bot
tom of the well, and deposits tuem
in a bos CO feet above the first floor.
Thè wnter drips from the buckets as
they go up, and not much is poured
into the received above, altdon»h it
is intended to be tl sort of dripping !
, . t -, ... . ..
miicbme. From this receiver the :
shot runs d wn a spout into u dry
... , 11 "
ing pan, which greatly resembles a
gigantic shoe, made of slieet iron,
.... .1-.
1 lie pan rests at an angle which per
mits the wet shot, to roll slowly down
tolhechamber below, and the pel
lets become perfectly dry as they pass
over thfl warm sheet,-iron.
An Eccentric Star.
The most singular fact connected
with the proper motions of the stars
is that oue or two stars are flying
through space with f,ncli enormous
rèpidity that the combined attraction
of all the stoi'8 visible with the teles
cope could never stop them. This
seems to be espocially the case with
a small star, invisible to the naked
«•ye, designate^ in astronomical liter
. ., i-i 1 0.1/1 it r
atuie as Gioombr.dge, 1S.J0,' froro|
the name of the astronomer who
recorded its position. The rate of
iiioüou of the star is about seven
seconds per jear-the greatest known.
It was hence concluded that it must
be very near us, and a number as
trotiieis have sought to determine its!
parallns, but have found it to be onlv
* , T J
n tenth of a second. Its apparent
motion in a year being seventy time*
it parallax, it, moves at least, seventy
times the distance from tlie earth to
the sun in a year, or eighteen mil
lions of miles every miles every sec
ond. From what we know of the
distribution^masses, and number of
the stars, it seems ;proablo that tie;
attraclion of nil ili ^e bodies in tliei
universe' : can never stop this head
1 ! • .1 . • .
Jong ppeed, nor bring this star into
«n orbit, und that consequently it'
will paRS through our universe, and
leave it entirely in its passage thtongh
infinite space. If we had accurate
observai ions of the star's position
tbre^orfo,.rtboa S «nd j.e» re «g<,,we;
could speak with more certainty of
its destiny. We may expect that,
onr posterity of a few thousand years
hence will, by the aid of the observa
tions and tables we shall transmit to
then), be able to comft to a
conclusion respecting the age and
the structure of the universe.
definite!
CO nfüsed T owards the L ast.
—All industrious citizen, who lives
not ■ over » thousand miles from
town, arose a few mornings ago,
while the festive lark was snot ing,
and with a tin bucket under his
ami went to the barn to milk the
family cow. It was dark and rainy,
and In fumbling about for old Pii in
die be got into the wrong pew, and
begun to pail the ofl'-mule of his
wagon team, lie can't remember
now which side of the roof he went
out at, but his recollection of
alighting on the picket fenee is
very vivid. He expects the buck
et* down in a few days.
