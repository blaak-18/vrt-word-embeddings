Thos. E. Watson, Esq., Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: Your favor of
the 16th inst. to hand, and I was
greatly pleased to hear from you.
T did see the defense you made of
my warehouse plan in the Constitu

learn that you so fully grasped my
intentions in furthering the plan
which 1 am now working upon, and
which I have no doubt will have effect
in lime to begin on next year’s crop.
I also beg to inform you that I
mailed you on Sunday night late my
(entitled ’“American Cotton
for Americans,’’ and 1 trust it will
meet with your approval, and that
your readers may obtain from same
some of the enthusiasm which pre
vails throughout my whole being when
cotton is the subject.
■ Yours truly,
D. J. Sully.

Sully refers will appear in Jeffer

A LETTER FOR CHARLIE.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear Sir: Please publish this for
the benefit of our little friend, Char
lie Ross Thaxton. I am proud of
Charlie. He has the grit, that I ad
mire and I wish we had more of the
jump about boys, the Jeffersonian
would be lead by more people in the
next quarter than was in the last, and
I would be proud if 1 could get all
men of all parties to read it well.
Charlie, I have passed the half way
mile post on my journey through life.
I will be 37 years old June 17th.
You ask if 1 am a wiggletail or
a pop? Well, Charlie, that is easy
answered; if there is a Populist on
this earth any stronger than I am, 1
would be glad to meet him and a man
that loves Mr. Watson better than I
do, does not live. And as to jumping,
Charlie, my farm consumes all of my
time but I never let a chance slip by
to say something for the Jefferspnlan.
Very respectfully yours,
Thos. E. Cartledge.

EXTORTIONS.
Winona, Tex., April 3, 1909.
The “Billy” Whitla abductors, ex
torting money from one man, has
caused a great stir all over United
States. But the extorting of millions
and millions from the whole people
by Carnegie, Rockefeller, Harriman,
Morgan and Belmont by and with the
advice of Senate and House of Rep
resentatives, causing many daily sui
cides, murders, thefts and other
crimes is praised and voted for by
the people.
Very respectfully,
O. Balfour.
LET THEM ISSUE MONEY NOT
BONDS.
Salem. Va, April 14, 1909.
Watson Jeffersonian Magazine:
I see that the Reps, are working
for a sew bond issue. I want you to
try and head them off. Will you
tell me how the government can in
crease its money supply by issuing
bonds, better issue money. I often
have to borrow money on negotiable
note. Never yet has that note added
one cent to the money supply, but
released that much from the bank
at my expense. Now if I had the
authority to issue scrip or money as
United States has, do you suppose 1
would miake a negotiable note or bond
and pay interest for the use of the
other fellow’s money, not much.
All parties agree we need more
money, and no one denies the legal
and moral right the government has
to issue money, then why not put out
the necessary amount in greenbacks,
as good as gold, instead of issuing
bonds to induce the banks to turn
loose. How long would it be before
the banks would repeat? I have tried
to make myself clear, but to be plain
lam an old time greenbacker. I en
close 10 cents for copy of magazine
containging your article on “Old
Abe.” Yours respectfully,
W. H. Tinsley.
AKIN TO ALL TOM WATSON
POPULISTS.
Bowersville, Ga., April 8, 1909.
Dear Mr. Watson: I sent in a list
of eight subscribers yesterday and I
will send in another list soon. It does
me good to see how the people are
changing. They are losing confidence
in the Old Ring Politicians as sure as
you live and between you and me the
Farmers’ Union men are going to take
care of you. I base my proof upon
my own community.
I received a letter a few days ago
from E. C. Glover in Alabama. He
said he read my letter in your paper
and desired to know if we were akin.
He said he was a Tom Watson Popu
list and I replied to him that we were
akin. That I c|aimec| kin with all
Jeffersonian
Glovers who loved Tom Watson.
I see that you would like for your
friends to hand out some samples-of
your two Jeffersonians. You can send
me as many as you desire and I will
be delighted to pass them out.
I believe I could sell a lot of your
books, Bethany and others, but I am
not able financially to order them. I
have had several calls for Bethany.
As soon as I can have the money to
spare I want to buy your magazine
from the first up to the present. I
would have been taking all the time
but have not been able to do so.
I am, as ever you friend,
W. G. Glover.
LET IT BE A CONTINUAL WAR
AGAINST SPECIAL FAVORS.
East Des Moines, April 13, 1909.
Mr. Thos E. Watson,
Dear Sir: You will please find en
closed P. O. order for three dollars,
for which send the Jeffersonian maga
zine as directed below.
My purpose is to send you six
names im order to get the “Story of
France,” which I have offered to lend
to those who subscribe as an induce
ment, and to get them acquainted
with your work.
You probably understand that lowa
is having an awful time opening its
eyes to the fact that a Southern man
can be possessed of any ability.
The inclination to work last fall
during the campaign was not at all
exhausting in this state, outside of a
few of us. I had started out solicit
ing names to our petition and was
getting about what was my portion,
when it suddenly dawned on me that
it would be necessary to gather a
good part of the harvest myself. So
I continued to work, night and day,
with the aid of Wm. Harvey, and suc
ceeded in getting two hundred and
forty-nine names at Des Moines. These
with the others were handed to the
Secretary of State.
Hard work need not discourage
anybody, for no great end or good
can be effected without a struggle.
We need not tear ourselves to pieces
at any time, but let it be a continual
war.against Special Favors.
I am on the jury now and take
occasion to drop a shell among them
to jar the wheels loose in their upper
stories and set them going.
I often think that if one-half of
the money that is spent on the public
press to keep people thinking that
the political world is made of green
cheese, was spent to enlighten them,
the results would be astounding, pro
vided howevejr, that the privileged
enemies of our beloved land were com
pelled to keep their mouths shut while
the good work was being done.
Talk it as they may, the salvation
of this country depends on the educa
tion of the common people so that
they may not gulp down all the rot
that is handed them by an assumed
superior class.
I am not yet ready to give up the
old pop scow, not because it is the
only one, but that it is the best one
so far as my judgment is able to dis
tinguish. I speak of principles, and
principles that have stood the fire as
long as ours have and yet live and
penetrate the very heart of the ene
mies camp are the ones of which to
build our fort, though they do disturb
the sweet repose of some of the self
established gods.
However it is not mine to say what
shall be our future course except as
it concerns me individually.
One of the wisest men whom I have
ever read, would listen to the opinion
of any man, even he who was con
sidered a fool, anxious to gather some
g’olden grain of thought.
I feel like continuing for <a while
yet, but this is enough to afflict you
with at one time.
God bless you,
S. M. Harvey.
“WHOM THE GODS WOULD DE
STROY.”
Spread, Ga., April 10, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Dear Sir and Brother:
As I see the parsons have fallen
afoul of you at such a lively rate
.since you took up the foreign mis
sions, it must be because you struck
them in a tender place that stirs their
animosity and causes them to jump
you.
Oh! how I admire the Christian
composure that you show forth in
your replies to them. “Whom the
gods would destroy they first make
mad. ’ ’
If the exposure of their corrupt
methods makes them mad, it lets them
down very low in the scale of Chris
tianity, and also shows that you hit
them where the skin is very thin.
You are telling it just like I would.,
if I could write like you.
As for Scoville, I think he shold
apologize to you for what he has
charged you with since you have
proved your case, and his is found
wanting. He should set himself right
before his people.
As we see truth subduing every
■thing that is corrupt in politics, I
want to see it take its place in the
Church of Christ and I verily be
lieve the door is open as the parsons
have struck back at you and the
cause you defend so bravely.
Please find enclosed $3.00 for which
send me your monthly magazine and
the continuance of your weekly Jef
fersonian.
Also the magazine to Jas. A. Hall,
Spread, Ga.
Yours truly,
H. S. Hall.
P. S. Please start magazine with
April number.
DOES NOT APPROVE PROHIBI
TION.
Vesta, Ga., April 12, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.:
Dear Sir: I am a subscriber to your
Jeffersonian and magazine and think
your editorial on Foreign Missions
worth five times more than the cost
of both Jeffersonians, also your re
ply to Brother Scovill was certainly
fine.
When it comes to being posted on
