New Orleans, Dec. 1-.-The snnth
bonud Illinois Central fast mai1 due here
at 7:I6 p. m., was held up and robbed by
a lose rain robber about one mile above
the upper limits of the city Thursday
night. Though some of the train crew
may they saw four or more m1en concealed
in the bushes, only one man figured in
the action, and his booty consisted only
of one registered mail pouch from Du
rant, Miss., and six other registered let
ters from points between Cairo and New
Orleans. Conduotor Kinnobrew was shot
in the groin and J. C. Parker, railway
mail clerk, has his left eye powder
burned by a shot directed at his head.
The robber got on the train, it is sup
posed, at some point above the city and
after passing Kenner, the last stop be
fore the train arrives in New Orleans,
he climbed over to the engine and cov
ered the engineer and fireman, and
brought the train to a standstill. When
the conductor came forward to see what
toie trouble was he was shot by the rob
ber. R. E. Goldsby, one of the railway
mail clerks, stuck his head out of the
door and was ordered to jump down
which he lid. The the robber led the
engineer, fireman and Goldsby toward
the express car and made one of them
blow the side out with a stick of dyna
mite which he supplied. This train car
ries no money and has no safe. The
robber then made for the mail car and
there discovered Parker, who had hid
den the registered pouches. He shot at
him and then one of the pouches was
produced and he made off with it. He
uncoupled the engine from the train. I
ran it to a point near Carroilton avenue
where he abandoned it. The route of
the engine was marked by mail pouches
and letters which the robber threw or
dropped out as he escaped.
The robber was evidently well so.
quainted with railroading. His face
was blackened and he was a man a lit
tde less than six feet tall, weighing
about 1140 pounds. He took Conductor
Kinnebrew's watch after he shot him.
Two suspects were arrested, but the
railway mail clerks did not identify
them. One of them, a tall man, when
he turned his back, struck Goldaby as
being of the robber's build. He was
captured on the outskirts of the city
and had a revolver and seemed to be
acting susmiciously.

United States transfer clerk went to the
door of the mail car and knocked for the
postal clerk to open it. No response
was given from the inside. Ofmoials
then forced an entrance to the car and
were astonished to find the olerk, John
N. Dennis, stretched upon the floor ap

A harried examination showed that
the registered packages had been ripped
open and robbed of their contents, the
most valuable of whioh was the Waoo

number of valuable packages.
