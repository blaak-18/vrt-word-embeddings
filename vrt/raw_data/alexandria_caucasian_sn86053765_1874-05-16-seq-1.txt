.1 inaiicial misfortunes having
forced mo$» dispose ol my plantai ion
in M issis^sippi, I . managed to save
onnngh 0 oiit of the wreck to pu r
chase six good mules and a, wagon,
with w hich I concluded to emigrate
to Texas with m.\, family, consist
ing of myself, my 'wife ami two
^laughters, aged lifted! find seven
let ti Years respectively, and a ligTil
coinpiexiimed negro man I hired,
who called hiinsell "Men lîiiller."
l'as^ufig tlinôigh Louisiana, I was
induced lo take the road from liar
risonburg to *( lollax, instead of to
Alexandria, th»v*iisfial route. -Wlien
nobdar Irom Colfax we eaine to a
Creek which was so swelled by re
ceid i'a'iis that wo could "not deter
mine ils tleplli, but, ^»u]iposing P
no! dangerous, I concluded to cross
it, and directed Men, who was driv
ing» b> go ahead. After gelling
well isi the m9dcs reached swim
niiag water, which, running wil h
gifal %api'iil y —soon look mules,
wagon ami all jjow n below where
Hie, road entnehmt, and as the wag
on wat; sinking wo all began® t<»
struggle for our lives, the. women
# sereauiing for help. In jumping
out I became, entangled in the liar
ucss, and after struggling some
time, became so exhausted f'liat, I
bm ame insensible.
When consciousness relornod 1
Ii'tind niysell lying upon the ground
sin rounded by my w ileà^id daugli
le^.-wand about a, do/,on meft, the
ciiicf <rf whoiirM as a young man ol
nbouf twenty-live, sumiufrs, ,ol me
duiiu Iieiglit, spare build, willi coal
black eyes und hair, ami a resolute,
ileb'i niiiied look, that bespoke him
at once the leader. The otlu is
were quiet looking young men, well
ai mod, with a soiious look peiva
<ling Ilie whole that convinced me
they wen. 1 not hunters, noi in search
of sport.
Seeing my eyes open, the. leader
said: "I am glad to set: ytni coming
round, sii;, and lo •assure you thai
your faniilv and effects are all safe."
I al templed to thank him, -but, he
interrupted me \*élh, "You owe inn
no thanks, sir, for Hie person does
not live thai I would not hav® done
as much for," and added : "I am
sorry to say yv.mr.man has hurt his
eye, bnl I t ru.' !, wil It a little care—
Iiis sight may bo restored." I then
noticed Men lying near me, with
one ol his eyes injured by coining
in contact' wilh.a limb overhanging
the creek, lie, was Ugly before, but
il struck me. that f*:.a occasion of a
blear eye w as no improvement to
him.
"i he stranger fix ii saying he was
compelled to lea ve, ordered his men
<«» mount, bade us adieu, raising his
hfit. to my wife and daughters w ilh
as liiticli ceremony as if they l«e
loiiged lo the royal family, and dis
ajtjieareil behind a hill, followed by
his men in a sweeping gallop.
My Ihistiiiio I had begun lore
cover my strength, and getting ii]>,
went to look after the wagon ami
nulles, all ol which I found safe—
though t lx* contents o 1 '* he wagon
w ci •; so wet wo concluded to re
main there all day to dry tlieni.
On the next morning we si ai ted
oil towards Colfax, and .had go I
williin :i low mdc,. of that ]dace
when wo wore confronted by a
crowd ol about, twenty negro men,
mounted on mules, the leader of
whom, a, mulatto, about thirty
years ol age, with a scar across his
Ince, asked mein a gruff tone where
I was going. I replied that, I de
sired to cross the liver at Colfax.
"You can't, go to < 'ol fax," sa id he,
"no damn white people can go
I here. UYliaVe the place, and will
soon liavri tlio whole country. Not
a white face shall be left to tell the
tale.»
1 tuen asked him il there was any
way for me. to get (ironnil Colfax—
and he said there was a road a short
dislance ahead, le; dingto the right,
Huit would ffike, mo around, "that
:s," he added» "if you have, a mind
to walk! for I irtinf these mules."
"An 1° wants one, ob de gals,'' said
one ât' liiis men, riding up. "An I
must hajo one too," said half a doz
en more at once, advancing to th«
wagon. And n#w commenced a
struggle more terrible than the one
ni the crejîk. There my wife and
daughters were trying to escape
death; here they -were trying to
o
avoid a. fate a thousand times more
horfible. @
I jmnpeu off the mule I was rid
iti|r, Ron, with his sore eye, being
iiïjlho wagon, aitil stood belbre my
nvffo and daughter trying to defend
them with my whip, when a blow on
I hn head froin@one of their guns
felled me lotho ground, and before
I could rise again I hey had dragged
all three of the wofuen from the
©
wagon. @
.inst at fhi« lime", when I was
about giving up in despair, one of
Hie negroes cried out, "N'asli!
Nash !" and th«' others joining in the
cry mounted their mules and lied
towards ^ollax, urging their ani
Onals lo the fop of their speed.
Inexpressibly relieved, I looked
back, and on the road I had just
I raveled, I saw a body of men ad
vancing in a sharp trot, and as they
approached us, I recognized the
same men that had rescued ii,%froin
the «'reek. They saluted us courte
ously,-when the quick eye of thier
leader seemed lo take in the whole
sit nation al a glance, and in^upiiek
ringing voice he said, "Come on
men, these men mnnl be arrested !"
and sticking spurs lo bis horse, he
stalled in hot pursuit, ©lonely tol
lowed by his men.
!\l'tor tf?e departure ofThese my. s
ferions men, who had rescued lis
Irom death and worse than death,
wo started on the road the negro
had told us would lake u@arouud
Colfax, and by evening had reached
Ketl Rive*, a lew miles above the
viih'igepand approached a desolate
looking h^uso standing near the
bank of tlio,"river. On reaching if
we.found it descried, ôait, the près
<•11 ce of a few venerilblo,®hungry
lookin
chickens convinced us that
Ihe owners were on&v teniporarily
absent; and in a few minutes a man
came ste;^|hily toward.« us from a
clump of bushes,,where he had been
concealed. His anxious ®coiinte
n. 111 ci' wore a sad, terrified took,
that toldol present suffering, and
grave' apprehensions of® future
trouble. Ho told us his wife and
four young children were hid out iu
I he woods; that all the white wo
men and child re u of I ho settlement
had I'cd |o to the woods Ii»» 1 safety,
as the negroes had boldly proclaim
cd that, they intended to kill Jhe
male whites and keep tlio girls ami
women for t henisclves.
"(•rent ( 1. pi r* said I, "<?in such
Illings be in a civilized country?"
"Kven so," he, replied, "and my*
own iniiiK'dial'o trouble that my
own wife and fallilron are sudor
ing from lyinger, and I have notli
ing to ^#ve f hem to eat." a
My wife went lo tlio wagon and
got some bacon and flour and gave
h iiiK Thanking lis | rofusely, and
wilif.'i rel : y>ved loolc", he* bade us
make any use we could o^his honst®
and disappeared in the woods.
W-e held a consultation -as to our
I n tu re course, my wife and daugli
fers lirgit.g i:xi to go on, but my
mules being much fatigued, (as we
all were) and Men complaining ol
his eye, I fell constrained to risk
one night here, to rest, and so we
entered the house and built a small
fire.
In a few minutes Hie man return®
od and told us' ho, had a little tod
der, v.'ii'ih I was \ cry gladly got
for my jaded mules.
'Are (hero many families eon
coaled in tho.woods?" I asked.
"IIundreds," he replied.
"And have you no one to call up
on for help ?"
"Our only hope," he replied, "lies
in one nfan, who is using every ef
fort to shield and protect us until
the. (iovernor, who has been applied
to, can send a force to quell the ne
groes and restore peace."
"And who is 'that man," I asked.
"Sheriff.Nash" he replied.
At this time three "negro men
and two women came rapidly up
the road from towards Coikfx, and
soon reached us. As stfon as the
man .sgw them, with a terrified look,
he, dar i cd into the bushes, and was
lost to view. One of the negro
men took Men aside and was eon
versing with him in an undertone,,
while the other t^Sio and the women
wore roughly questioning usas to
our busiire.-s in thai country: w®i^
w'e didn't stay where we came from?
"You whites" said one of the wo
men, a savage looking hag, "have e
no business in- this country; it be
longs to us and we will drink th®
blood of the wiiit* race if we lind
them encroaching upon our lands,"
o
My terror stricken wife told her
that, w.e were only passing through,
and had no. desire to remain.
"Blit you had no right to psss
through it; it belongs to us. The
Government; gaye it to us, and yon
had no right to put your foot on it."
We were now joined by two more
negro men, who also came from tho
direction of Collax. Ben, mean
time, .approached the .wagon, auil
deliberately picked up a small box
containing all our silverware, some
of it heir looms iu tho family, that
had descended tfown through sev
eral generations^ and that was
prized above anything wo bad.
When 1 ventured to remonstrate
with him he sullenly said he want- °
edit, and walked down the road
wilh it, accompanied by the man I
had noticed talking with him. 4
flic negroes now crowded around
thc^wagon, and began to examine
its contents, saying they were short
of provisions at Colfax, when ono a
of the women, looking up the road,
said: "Lookout, white-men com
in' !" The men began to cry out,
"Nash! Nash 1" and, becoming pan
ic-stricken, ranin every direction,
and were soon lost, sight of in tho
thick undergrowth. *
And now again appeared ourpre*
servers—Sheriff ïfash and his no
ble band of men, who for tl^e third
time had saved us. jyter saluting
us courteously, as was his wont, he
kindly inquired ifwo were all snfo
and well ; and on being answered
in tho nflirnia! ivo, cong atulatcd us
on our being over our troubles. In
response to my look of inquiry he
said: "In a few moments 1 will
have, a, boat here and put you across
the river, alter which you will be
out of danger."
On my com wen ein g to tell" fei in
about what I had just heard of the
women and children being iu the
woods, he said :°"I know it, all, and
have just boon trying „to comfort
and provide for them as well as 1
could."
"And when will „this strange
trouble end ?" I aslu'd.
."God only knows," he answered,
with a troubled look, "if the Gov
ernor sends any force hero it will
end at once; if not, it is impossible
to tell. Let ns hope that, through
merciful I'rovidence, it may end
speedily." Q ,
The boat, whiijji he was having
orought down the river for some 0
purpose, now appeared in sight, and
on being hailed by one of his men,
came in, and in a short time, by tho
kindly assista neoeof his men, wo
were safely landcd 0 on the opposite
shore. o
e
In bidding him adieu, T fohl him
I would not attAnpt to thank him
Jbr what ho, had done for us, as I
could lind ho ftords to oxpresg what,
I flölt. His answer, as before, was :
"You owe me nothing, I am thank
ful to be able to afford relief to any
one in distress. The, women, more
demonstrative®shed tears of grati
tude. ©Q
A*?ler crossing llie turbid water so
of Red River, our troubles were
over; and now, from our peaceful 0
Texas homo, liigjitly ascend our
humble orisons in unison to®tho
mighty Protector of the hetphns,
Hint lie may help and keep SherifP
