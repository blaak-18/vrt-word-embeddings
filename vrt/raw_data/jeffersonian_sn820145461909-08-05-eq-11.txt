tending that such a born commander
as Sheridan need be afraid of him.
Well might Little Phil be in dread
of these fearless privates who knew
that they were not handled right, but
who laughed about it and fought on
with sublime courage, until the final
scatteration of the handful of survi
vors at Waynesboro. The last line
of defence that these devoted men
threw up is yet to be seen; it is on
my Blue Ridge farm.
Says General Gordon:
“Among the pieces of artillery
sent us by the War Department was
a long black rifle-cannon, on which
some wag had written in white let
ters, ‘Respectfully consigned to Gen
eral Sheridan through General Early,’
and Sheridan got it.’’
Little Phil captured it a few days
after Old Jube received it.
On the morning of Appomattox
Sheridan spoke to Gordon of this gun,

THE DANGEROUS AUTOS.
Dear Sir: —Will you please be so
kind as to publish the law in regard
to automobiles running the public
roads through our country?
There is a great deal of anxiety
among the people of this country as
to whether or not there is any protec
tion by the law. If so, to what ex
tent? 7
The lives of many people are being
endangered by them from day to day.
I attended a county union meeting
and this matter was discussed to
some extent. Resolutions were pass
ed to learn the law, is why I appeal
to you. Please publish in your valu
able Jeffersonian paper.
We Poplists of this section are
very anxious about this matter.
Yours respectfully,
J. F. HARTLEY.

Dear Mr. Watson:—Can you lay

and of the inscription which was still
on it when captured.
Brother Todd, don’t ever again get
the idea that I could, under any cir
cumstances, abuse a Confederate sol
dier. Accuse me of almost anything
you can think of, —and it will hurt
me less than that. But don’t ask me
to class Early as the equal of Sheri
dan in generalship.
I think it highly probable that Gen
eral Gordon, if given independent
command, might have proved himself
a match for Sheridan. Gordon’s ge
nius was purely military, and of a
high order; but he never got the
chance to develop and display it. The
West Point tradition put an inferior
man over him and kept him there. If
General Lee could have freed him
self from that fetter, and given the
Valley campaign into the keeping of
Gordon its results would have been
very different.
The bill which approves allowing
street railways to grant free passes
to policemen and firemen was ap
proved with the addition of free
passes to water-works and sanitary
department employees.
Two bills looking toward preven
tion of tubuculosis failed to pass.
A bill was passed prohibiting for
eign insurance companies from tak
ing their cases into the Federal
courts, on penalty of forfeiting their
charter.
The anti-trading stamp bill was
passed by the House. A bill look
ing toward the establishment of
high schools in the rural districts is
under favorable consideration.
The general tax act is still under
consideration. The trend at the
present seems in favor of biennial
sessions of the Legislature.
quiet another Foreign Mission enthu
siast? This one, like the others, only
abuses Watson. The way these
fanatics rave and fume because you

funny. Do you suppose these par
sons really think abuse is argument?
They do not produce any argument,
but the way they do froth at the
mouth and heap abuse on Watson is
conclusive evidence that we need a

Tobacco Kills
FACE TO FACE WITH DEATH.
There’s nothing that can be said in
favor of the tobacco habit. It’s expen
sive; filthy; injurious to health—posi
tively dangerous. Nicotine is a deadly
poison witness the thousands of
deaths from tobacco heart, tobacco
cancer, from diseases of stomach, liv
er, kidneys that had their start in to- •
bacco poison.
“Easy-To-Quit” is a positive, abso
lute “stopper” for any tobacco habit.
It is a vegetable remedy and any lady
can give it secretly in food or drink.
It is harmless; leaves no reaction or
bad effects, and it stops the habit to
stay stopped.
Mothers, save the young smoker’s
brain, he cannot do it himself. Wives,
sisters and sweethearts, help save the
mind, body and future of some one
who is near and dear to you. Without
your help it may not be done.
