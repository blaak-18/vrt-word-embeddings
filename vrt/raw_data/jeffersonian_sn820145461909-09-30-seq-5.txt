HAPPY JACK JOSEPH HOOKER CAMP
O “the little church around the
corner” belonged Happy Jack,
and it belonged to him. For
many years he had been its
T
faithful deacon. He helped to build
it, when it had grown from a little
street mission; had brushed the
floors, made the fires, and took up
the collection for many years. His
always cheerful, laughing blue eyes
had gained him the title of Happy
Jack, a name of which he was well
proud.
But poor “Happy,” if he is longer
happy, it is in remembrance of those
blissful days when he was free, and
well in the confidence of his many
friends; when he gathered his little
brood around the family altar after
the tiresome day’s work was finished,
and offered up thanks for the bless
ings of the day. In such fond remin
iscences only, did he now brood over
these happy days, and forget for a
spell, if forget he could, his present
dreary, dismal confines.
Listen to our story and your heart,
if you have a heart, will go into
the home that Happy left, into the
life he lived, his ups and downs, and
his bitter end —not end, but eternity.
“Whose de guy passin’ de hat,
Jimmy?” whispered little Pat Roo
ney one evening at the little church,
“haint he roustin’ on Swift’s dock?”
“Yes, works for Pete Bracken in
de Cellar and comes up when dey are
loadin’ exports, or Bostons.”
“I’m goin’ to drop in a button.”
“Don’t you do it. He’s an alright
guy, I know him. Caught me snip
in’ a weanie one day and never
knocked. I’d like this church better
if they’d all be as good as Happy
Jack.” And when Happy came by
with the plate, both boys looking up
into his big blue eyes, half studying
him, and half admiring him, dropped
each a penny as Happy recognized
them and smiled.
Happy had been employed at the
Swift Packing Company for several
years, starting in as a common la
borer, and had worked himself up to
what they called a “straw boss”,
which meant added responsibilities,
the same hard work, and but little
advance in pay. Fifteen cents per
hour was the average wage for com
mon labor, but because Happy was
well acquainted with the work, and
could be trusted to the oversight of
certain little jobs, such as loading
out a batch of hams, or cleaning up
some vats, keeping the trucks and
floor clean, they paid him seventeen
cents per hour.
Happy had a wife and six children,
and to better care for them, he had
purchased, on installments, a small
hut of which fifty or more of the
same type had been put up by a
building association. The little
houses were neat and cozy, but the
price at which they were sold, more
than doubled the association’s in
vestment. But Happy did not mind
that. He wanted a home, and like
hundreds of other poor men, he had
availed himself of the only means
then open to him. He could, in time,
pay it out at the same rate as rent.
Happy was ih good standing with
the Company when be purchased the
little home, and all seemed bright
before him. He had figured that his
eldest son would soon be able to
bring five or eight dollars each week,
and then things would move along
all right. As it was, living must be
confined to the closest possible lines.
No extra clothes could be indulged
in, every garment must be mended,
and remended, as long as a stitch
would hold. This was when the
health of the family was good, and
Happy -had steady work, with long
hours. Had he calculated on a cut
in wages, or the possible cutting
down of hours? The worst is always
to be feared, of course, and we can
only expect a man in Happy’s posi
tion to look far ahead and shadow
up some discomforts, but the game
must be risked.
Good times continued for a year
or more, but the end of the debt was
still several years off. His property
rose in value, as did the taxes. But
his wages were still the same. He
averaged seventy hours each week,
which gave him an envelope each
Thursday of about $11.90.
Then came a great strike of the
butchers. The killing beds were run
on less than half time, which meant
a slump in every department. Hun
dreds of men were laid off. Poor
Happy, his heart was in his mouth
every day, when he saw men all
around him cut out of the ranks,
added to the great horde of the un
employed who were upon the market.
The Company did the best it could
under the circumstances, and kept
as many men as possible, even by
cutting down the hours per day to
nearly half what they had been.
Each Sabbath found Happy at the
little church, faithful and true to his
Heavenly Master, as he was to his
earthly. It was now fall, and winter
was coming on, with its added ex
penses for fuel. Work had not pick
ed up, nor were there any indications
that it would.
It is here that our story saddens,
as well as colors. Man is not master
of his environments, his temper, nor
his needs. Happy could not help it
that he made but little over half
time, could not help it that he felt
in his heart that the Company was
responsible in not compromising with
the butchers and bringing the strike
to a close, could not help it that his
family was living on half rations,
that the cold of the sharp November
days and nights compelled him to
buy coal.
It was one crisp December morn
ing that the boss came to Happy and
told him what a good man he had
been, how well his services had been
performed for the Company, and
how they liked him, and hated to
part with him, but such had been
ordered, owing to him being a sev
enteen-cent man, when his place
could be filled with a fifteen-cent
man. Poor Happy said nothing, but
took his money and staggered home
with a heavy heart. What chance
had he of getting work among the
hundreds who were looking for any
kind of work, at any wages? At
these thoughts his heart sank within
him. Where could he go? He had
no money to pay expenses of moving,
and where could he find work?
Great tears came to his big blue eyes,
his heart beat fast, and his face
Cljc. TUeffersonicut
flushed with anger as the truth came
to him that the Company was placing
a heavy hand upon its employees for
the purpose of stamping out once
and for all, “The Amalgamated Meat
Cutters’ Union.” Was the Company
his common enemy, or was it a suf
ferer with himself? No, the awful
fact had come to him with force that
could not be resisted; he was being
victimized.
Indian summer had now passed,
and the mellow hue gone from the
pale, yellow rays of the De
cember sun. The trees were bare
and the grass yellow. Winter stalk
ed abroad blowing his icy breath
hither and thither. Happy’s mon
ey was now down to the last dol
lar, the coal would be gone in two
weeks, provisions were high, and
even if cheap, the last dollar could
not go very far.
One evening the scanty supper was
over, the fire had burned low, and the
children had retired for the night.
The faithful wife was finishing the
supper dishes as Happy sat half
asleep, dreaming and musing with a
heavy heart. His mind wandered far
and wide. It went back to the
happy days when he was a boy on
the farm, when to want for the com
forts of life was a thing of story, but
never realized; it went back to the
happy days when he had first con
tracted for his little home, which he
could now fancy under the auction
eer’s hammer; it went step by step
through the many details of his work
at the packing house as he had been
accustomed to go over it daily, year
after year, and as he dwelt in half
yearning retrospect in the little
nooks and crannies of the great dark,
damp pickle cellar, his heart leaped
and he sat breathless for a moment.
It seemed to him that he stood near
the back door that led out on the
loading dock. In the dense dark
ness, a faint light shone upon a pile
of “sours”, a class of hams that were
too large to take the pickle, and had
heated near the bone, and would
have to be treated if saved at all.
They were not of much value to the
Company, yet they could be worked
up into sausage.
Every inch of the building was
known to Happy, back yards, switch
gates and all. It was about 8 p. m.,
just the time the engines were set
ting cars from the dock to the out
track, and replacing them with emp
ties for the next day’s work. It
would be easy to slip into an empty
and be shoved up under the sheds,
when getting out would be no item.
He could take him and drop it over
the high fence out in the darkness
where no watchman would see him,
and then go out at the gate as a
workman going home and never be
suspected.
This worked fine and next morn
ing the family sat down to a square
meal. No one but Happy and wife
knew how the ham had got there.
This was grand, why not lay in a
supply? And so the second, third
nights and so on, added each a fine
large ham to Happy’s larder, until
the winter was relieved of one hid
eous aspect at least. But poor Hap
py, not satisfied with what would
