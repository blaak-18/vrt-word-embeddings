THE DREADED BLOW FALLS.
We have lived in fear of this an
nouncement that comes from Fort
Worth. Hoping against hope as the
days passed and the blow was delay
ed, we now resign ourselves to the
inevitable. At least suspense is at
an end.
William Jennings Bryan is report
ed as saying that if the party de
mands and the conditions warrant it
he will be a candidate for the Presi
dency in 1912.
Since Mr. Bryan is now the Demo
cratic party there can be no room for
doubt as to the existence of the de
mand. The conditions that would
warrant his running are also wholly
in his own hands, as he alone will be
the judge of them. If he can devise
some new policies to substitute for
those that have been already proved
unprofitable from a vote making
standpoint, the only essential condi
tion should be supplied. In his abil
ity to meet this requirement we have
absolute faith. His ingenuity will
not fail him.
Our fear, above referred to, is not
caused by any apprehension that the
result will be different from what it
has been on previous occasions, but
merely because we are wearying of
the deadly monotony this perpetual
candidacy forces upon a long suffer
ing people. —Louisville Herald.
THE BREAD LINE.
The 1 ‘bread line” is more than a
tragic incident of the “stringency”;
it is the most perfect type of what’s
the matter with us generally. The
bread line reaches from Eastport
to San Diego, and we are all in it—•
every man of us. Every one of us —
doctors, lawyers, priests, merchants,
mechanics and millionaires —is tremu
lous for his bun and porridge, and
keeps his place in the long queue with
jealous dread. We have consented
that the poor should be driven by the
lash of necessity, and so we all hear
the whistle of the blacksnake. The
man that works because he must galls
the heel of the man that loafs be
cause he must; both walk in the same
bread line. Both are sullen. Both
are indigent. Both have missed the
meaning of life. The anxious, irasci
ble Mr. Morgan, bullying the scared
bankers into momentary union; our
sulky, saturnine Lorenzo di Medici,
with his bales of books and acres of
pitcures that he does not understand
—he, perhaps, brings up the rear of
the bread line. But he is certainly
there.
Abraham Lincoln said that the
country could not possibly endure
half slave and half free. He made a
limited application of the precept.
But he, of all men, was most capable
of expounding its wider and pro
founder implications. Lincoln didn’t
say what follows here. But he might
have done so —with improvements—
if he had had time for the study of
certain phases of political economy,
latent in his day and requiring the
eye of the seer, but now overt and
plain to any observer.
Mr. Lincoln might have said: “This
country cannot endure half proleta
rian and half plutocratic. You can
not permanently maintain a ‘work
ing’ class alongside of a ‘moneyed’
class. If half of you are drudges,
without ideals, without freedom, they
will drag the other half down into
their slavery. You will all be drud
ges; you will all disbelieve in your
own ideals; you will all live from
hand to mouth. Your upper class
cannot be free until you have freed
your lower class. If you would have
a fortuned class, delivered from sor
didness and the shiver of panic, you
must plan to have a rich society. You
must abolish poverty. It is high time.
With all your modern tools hunger
and houselessness is an anachronism.
With these tools every worker can
produce ten times as much as he bare
ly needs. And if any considerable
class of your workers —even a tenth
of them—get only the necessaries of
life, or less than that, I warn you that
the loot of their unpaid labor will
corrupt your system from root to top
and bankrupt your society. It is not
safe to have even a few slaves. You
cannot afford to have even a small
class of necessitous people—people
that shiver in the bread line.”—
Chas. Ferguson, in N. Y. American.
A USELESS EXPERIMENT.
That idiotic absurdity, an “Adam
less Eden,” which has so often been
tried without success, is about to have
another inning. This time the ex
periment is to be made on Long Isl
and, and a Russian woman, one Ma
dame Davidoff, is the promoter. It
may be that her experience with the
men of her own country has soured
her on mankind, but it is safe to pre
dict that she will fail if she tries it
with the women of this country.
What the original Eden would have
been without an Adam, is a most per
tinent question. And if it was not
good for man to be alone, how much
less good it would have been for wo
man to live alone.
It is to be supposed that snakes
will be barred, and that will be an
other variation from the original
garden. If a real serpent should find
the way into this new Eden it is rea
sonable to suppose that the place
would soon be vacated and it would
not be much better if rats and mice
should sneak into the forbidden
grounds. One of the objects of this
venture is to try the experiment of
growing fruits and flowers through
out the winter with the aid of elec
tricity, and one account states:
“Madame Davidoff is a writer for
magazines. She says the experiments
will be based on the theory that the
growth of vegetable matter, which
ceases at sundown, will continue
through the night if proper artificial
light is supplied to stimulate the de
veloping powers of plants. Fruits and
flowers that are grown in this section
only in the spring and summer
months, she believes, can be culti
vated during the entire year by sup
plying necessary artificial light
tlyough the electrical process that will
be adopted. ’ ’
This is all very well, but will the
Jeffersonian
absence of men make the plants grow
more freely? Is there any psycho
logical or any other reason why the
presence of male humanity will stop
plant development? Men are mighty
handy around the house, especially
after dark, when the owls hoot, the
frogs croak, the bugs fly around, and
the snakes and lizards sneak through
the grass. And then if the average
woman can not have a man to boss
and order around and lay all the
blame on, what will life be worth to
her? It’s reasonable to predict that
Madame Davidoff will be Madame
Leavitoff in a year or two. Women
without men are utter failures, and
vice versa. —Columbia State.
AFTER THE BATTLE.
“We have stood,/’ says the Mobile
Register, “by the ship until the end,
and participated in the sorrows of the
shipwreck. We doubt if the mate
rials that are left are worth reassem
bling, but time will tell, and we shall
wait and see. Os one thing we are
sure: that the rebuilding of the ship
on right lines from the salvage will
be extremely difficult and that it may
be easier to throw away the old and
begin anew, as the makers of our
constitution did when they found the
articles of confederation inadequate
to the need of the republic.”
The New Orleans Picayune takes an
even more pessimistic view of the
situation when it says:
“It looks as if the Democratic par
ty as a political power, has come to an
end. It will continue to exist in some
of the States for local purposes and
there will always be a dominant
white party in the South, but as a
national power the indications are
that Democracy will play a very
subordinate part. Issues are chang
ing with great rapidity. The Repub
lican party is the parent of all the
great private fortunes in the Union
and of all the vast corporate monopo
lies and trusts. Under its fostering
care a money power has been created
and built up, and of necessity the
offspring must stand for its parent in
a struggle that threatens both.
“Realizing, as the American people
will, that no constitutional conserva
tive organization like the grand old
party of constitutional guarantees and
Jeffersonian principles can overthrow
a political party intrenched and main
tained by a vast consolidation of
wealth, the time will come when
means will be found, not provided for
in the National Constitution, to work
such changes as the people may and
surely will demand.”
These explanations of the causes of
defeat are very natural in the position
the national Democracy finds itself in.
But there ’ such a thing as saving
the pieces in a wreck, and the fifteen
States of the South can, while saving
themselves from home dangers, offer
a nucleus for a party, be it old or
new, which will defend the rights of
the iStates and offer to individuals a
fair field and no favors. There must
still be room for Jeffersonian doc
trines in this country, and the sole
chance for procuring a Jeffersonian
party seems to be centered by circum-
stances in the South. Let the Register
and the Picayune regain hopefulness.
Neither should despair of the repub
lic. If the South will stand by his
toric principles, time will do the rest.
Don’t lose faith in the good sense of
the American people and in the reme
dies of Father Time. —Birmingham
Age-Herald.
THE “CON’L,” SAH!
On the strength of the evidence be
fore the public, the South will not be
hasty to vaunt the Tennessee
“Con’l” (Duncan Cooper) of the
late civil war, as a type of the gal
lantry and chivalry of that great pe
riod.
It is, indeed, to be noted that these
“majabs” and these “eon’ls,” whose
“gallantry and chivalry” are most in
evidence in print, are not those who
left the most legible tracings on the
history of that bloody period.
It is entirely likely that Tennessee,
machine-ridden as it is, has a people
and a press more alert than we some
times are to punish murder and at
tempted' murder.
Carmack is one of the very few
Southern men who has stood out in
Washington a conspicuous man among
the giants of personal popularity, of
political astuteness and of force of
brain who assemble there.
Ask the average man whom we
have there off-hand and he will
say: “Well, there is John Sharp
Williams and Carmack —and —” and
there is liable to be a long hiatus just
at that point.—The Harlequin.
REMEMBER THE WOMAN IN
RAGS.
By Joel B, Fort.
■' ■
The rumble and roar of the city to
hear,
The gay and the festive lay,
Brings joy and comfort to my list
ning ear —
And a hope for the coming day.
But a joy never comes, else sorrow
comes, too,
And following the sun, there’s a
cloud,
For the rich man arrayed in purple,
and blue
Is followed by the pauper crowd.
Oh! God hear the cry of the needy
and poor,
The rich man has comforts, and lags
In the bounties that come to the la
borer’s door,
But remember the woman in rags.
The Ancient Order of Democratic
Grave Diggers are busily engaged
burying Tom Watson for the eleven
hundredth time. These poor fellows
have been on the job for fifteen years
now and every time they pronounce
the finish of their work Tom scratch
es out livelier than ever. The trou
ble with the cemetery force seems to
be they are in the fix of the little
boy’s pa who came home in the rain
with a package of asafetida on his
person —they are dead themselves and
don’t know it.—Meigs Review.
