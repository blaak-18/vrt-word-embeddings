KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
DONALD KENNEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in one of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
(both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of its value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle and a perfect cure is war
ranted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains, like needles passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts being
stopped, and always disappears in a week
after taking it.
if the stomach is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.
Dose, one tablespoonful in water at bed
time, and read the Label.

these meetings between the peo
ple of all nations in tests of aquatic
skill; and that their efforts have been
appreciated has been Satisfactorily
demonstrated by the large and eager
crowds which have been present at
these unique entertainments. Such
bouts were hardly ever before wit
nessed as have taken place in the la
goon of the White City since the novel
idea was first introduced, a few days
ago. There have been entered in these
remarkable contests representatives of
almost every race under the sun, ex
cepting the Chinese. John is not a
lover of notoriety and prefers the re
tirement of hNs own quiet quarters and
the seductive fumes of his peculiar pipe
to the noise and excitement of a public
gathering. Besides he is not much given
to sports, beyond an occasional hand
at his favorite fan-tan, bung-loo or
some other game of chance which does
not call for much physical exertion.
The course followed in the canoe and
swimming races is through the court of
honor before the Administration build

piers and bridges along the line are a

Prizes ranging in value according to
the difficulty of the feat to be per

competitor in each bout, and it is high
ly amusing to witness the efforts of the
different nationalities to carry off the
prize. Each representative has a fol

Pam nnythtnt to b-meR 1aShifaht
Within the last few Isys aevessl fete I
days have been enjoyably celebrited.
Several of the states have hali their
days, as -have also the negroes, the
grocers and buathers and several be
nevolent associations. On these odi
sions the crowd attains to mammoth
proportions and the grounds present a
holiday appearance. Each fetb day is
marked by some special order of exer
dises. and the members of the' associa-l
tion or fraternity so honored lay aside
all business cares and flock to the fair
grounds for a day of general jollity and
recreation. It is safe to say that no
world's fair in all the history of na
tions has ever been so fully given over
to the people as is this of our Cdlum
bian year.
The daily attendance has reached
an average of nearly two hundred
thousand and there is a promise qf. a
large increase during the remaihing
two months of the fair. A payment of
ten per cent. on the bonds has aj.
been ordered and it begins to looFa
A FEATUIRE OF THW PARADE.
though there would be some profit in
world's fair stock in spite of the opin
ion of certain knowing ones to the con
trary. Retrenchment has been the
order in the management of late and
many large salaries have been reduced
or entirely cut off, and in other ways
the expenses have been reduced, all of
which goes to show that our great ex
position is in a fair way to prove a
financial success.
The history of the Sunday closing at
the world's fair has been interesting
and highly amusing. First, the of
ficials declared, in private sesaion, that
the gates must be opened on Sunday
because they "could not afford to waste
the day;" and in public they pleaded
the cause of the poor workingman, who
had no other day to come to the fair.
Religious exercises were arrangeld
within the grounds and the gates
opened, but somehow the Chicago
workingman did not realize his advan
tages, or found that a day of sight
seeing was the poorest possible prep
aration for a week of toil. He did not
need the Bible to counsel a day of rest.
Experience became an individual and
potent teacher. The small crowds that
did come on Sunday were far more
likely to make their way to the theaters,
dancing halls and beer gardens of the
Plaisance, than to the Art gallery or
Horticultural hall, and few appre
ciate the advantage of paying fifty
cents to go to church on the fair
grounds when far more attractive
preaching is offered free of cost out
side the gates. The majority of state
buildings, all the exhibits of Great
Britain and her colonies and hundreds
of others were closed on Sunday, and
the attendance slowly diminished.
Then the authorities discovered that
the "poor workingman" inside the
grounds needed a day of rest, and, on
account of this and other deductions,
decided to close the great gates.
The Ubiquitoun Guard.
They were walking in the Fisheries
building. He looked with a hungry
eye at the trout, the bass and the pike,
and then, having made the rounds of
the tanks, he turned to his companion
and criticised the exhibit
"Why, what is missing?" asked the
wife.
"Missing!" exclaimed the man, with
an air of disgust, "why, they've got
everything but the fish we used to
catch-the best fish that ever shook a
fin or a tail and a fish that should have
a gilt-edged tank all by himself."
"What fish as that?"
"Pumpkin seeds, my dear, pumpkin
seeds."
"Were you looking for pumpkin
seeds?" asked a courteous guard, with
some timidity.
"That's what we were," growled the
visitor.
"Well, then, you'll find them over at
the Agricultural building," the guard re
plied, as he strode away unmindful of
the gob of disgust he had left behind.

ate oexa-CroWI1.Agt.
Most southern farmers rely mainly
upon the moneyed crop--cotton. Iii
March, April and May the crop is
planted; in July the crop has been
"laid by," and August and September
are .passed, for the most part, in com
parative idleness; by November 15 the
r bulk of the crop is gathered and sold,
and nearly all the money spent; and
then up to March 1 our farmers per
form but little work, except to feed the
stock and keep in a supply of wood,
eating up and consuming largely
what they. have earned by their sum
Iner labor.
They are poor In purse,of course, and
will stay poor, and ought to stay poor.
A goodly part of the year is spent in
talking politics. Too much cotton and
too much loafing in town, and too much
talking of politics have almost bank
rupted this country.
ROBBERY SYSTEM.
Robbing the soil year by year, and
paying bacek nothing, does not pay in
the end. We know some farmers who
added largely to their bank accounts
by continuous robbing of the soil; but
the time came when the soil failed to
respond liberally, and in a few years
the money in the bank was gone-due
to following this persistent and ruth
less robbing of the land.
But in time, as a matter of natural
consequences, the land had become im
poverished, and the farmer awoke to
the realization of the fact that in rob
bing the fertility of his land he had
robbed himself, as the gradual disap
pearance of the bank fund proved. A
number of just such men live right
here, and their names and methods are
as familiar as the nose on our own face
or the hand that pensthese lines. Some
of their heads are hoary with the frosts
of old age, but not all of them.
REDUCE TBEP COST OF PRODUCTION
I should be the farmer's earnest study.
1 Cost of production is largely lessened
in many ways: First, in having the
land well plowed and the clods pulver
ized-in fact, by thorough preparation
of the soil before the seed are
planted. Second, "by using the best
quality of seed and putting in the
ground in the right manner. Third,
by using fertilizers of the right kinds
and proportions, wisely applied.
Fourth, planting, cultivating and har
vesting as much as possible by ma
chinery, and substituting animal for
human labor.
It does not do to plant a crop on poor
land and expect much profit.' Poor
soil will not produce profitable crops.
Cammon sense ought to teach this.
But people do not always use their best
common sense to the best advantage.
It is usually good judgment that in
sures success, and bad judgment that
results in failure.
If we do not cultivate the mind and
use the knowledge that experience
and reading impart, then we are wast
ing our mental capacities and advan
tages without practical personal bene
fits in winning financial success
"hiding our light under a bushel"
sacrificing our wealth of natural mind
and harvesting thorns and thistles and
poverty, when we might have been
able to amass wealth in money, wealth
in knowledge, and a greater wealth in
the reflections of a busy life and days
spent for a useful purpose.
NATURE HELPS.
Let man prepare the soil and fertilize
it, sow the seed, cultivate the growing
plants, and nature will do the rest.
The better the land is prepared, the
richer it is made by green or stable
manure and commercial fertilizers,
and the better the seed and the care in
planting, and the more intelligently
and thoroughly the crops are culti
vated, nature continually assists man's
efforts, pursues and finishes its work
all the more satisfactorily to the hus
bandman.
Nature does its work, and does it
well; but if man neglects to assist na
ture. and refuses to perform his duty
in making all the conditions the most
favorable, then nature, while still do
ing its work well. can not be expected
to do man's work, too. and bestow
bountiful crops and products of su
perior excellence. In agriculture it
can truly be said that nature helps
those most who helps-nature most.
And now, if we do our part well in
sowing, fertilizing and cultivating, na
ture will do the rest-sustain and watch
over and develop the plants, and bring
them to maturity and fruition.-Edwin
Montgomery, in Farm and Fireside.
SPEACH CULTURE.
Some lints to Southern Farmers by One
Who Has Been There.
I have just read WV. L. More's letter
on "Peach Culture in the South," and
while interested in it I can not approve
his plan.
Peach trees do not require a very
rich soil. Thin, sandy-land, underlaid
with gravel, produces fine neaches. On
rich land there will be a fine growth
of the tree. but the fruit will rot.
Ashes and phosphate may be used to
advantage, but strong manures should
be avoided, lie says a person whocon
templates planting a peach orchard
should always provide the variety that
is best adapted and has been tested by
some experienced horticulturist or
nursery man and not depend on
seedlings. as only one seed in
ten will produce fruit like
that from which it was taken. While
the truth is seven out of ten at least
will be the same, two bitter and possi
bly one not good. lie shows the value
of nursery stock when he sayvs Craw
ford's late does not ripen until Octo
ber, while it ripens in July, rarely as
late as August and comes in immedi
ately after Crawford's early. Both of
these peaches have a red cheek: the
lemon peach does not, yet he seems to
think they are the same peach. The
true lemon peach, Ipure bred; that is
one that has never been grafted. does
ripen, he says. in October, but it be
longs to the Spanish variety, and was
here hundreds of 'years before Craw
ford was born.
My plan of raising peaches is to get
seeds of.tbe varzeties that I want, make
a hole in the ground four inches deep, I
one hole for each variety, and put a i
stake in one which is written the kind. I
whether cling or free-stone. large or

Then Il select the place for my or- i

riin. I save all the ashes I can, br
I ng the leaelieid if I can get no other,
And sow broadcast on the land and
plow under-it March.
In April my peaoh seed will begin to
sprout and I lay off the land in checks
twenty feet wide and plant the seed as
soon as sprouted and covet four inches
deep with well rotted chip mtanttre or
top soil from the woods.
If the land is- not as large as is neces
sary to plant all my seed I plant in
what is called a "quincunx," that is
one stree between every four, which
gives me more trees to the acre and
makes them no nearet together. I
drive a stake down by each seed, lay
the land off in four feet rows for cot
ton, having no cotton in the row of
trees.
Th'n for the cotton make a compost
of cotton seed and phosphate,put in the
drill at the rate of 400 pounds of the
first and 200 of the latter per acre, The
land can be cultivated, if necessary,
two years in cotton. The second year
sow "Bur" clover seed between the cot
ton rows the last of July or first of
August, and run a 20-inch sweep just
as shallow as possible. The Bur clover
will grow through the winter and die
down in May or June, when the land
can be sown in pease. Never transplant
a tree that bears a stone fruit, for it
heads off the top - root, and never graft
one, for it will soon decay.--C. C. L.
Dill, in Southern Farm.
Wsanlng Youang Figs.
If at five or six weeks old the young
pigs are eating and growing well, in
crease their feed, giving them all that
they will take, and decrease the feed
of the sow gradually for nearly two
weeks. At the end of this time the
two strongest youngsters of the litter
are taken away. Again, after two
days, another pair, and so on till all
are weaned. This tends to even up
the different pigs of the litter, if there
is any variation in size and uniformity
in a lot, and add, to their selling value.
By following this course the sow is
given the very best chance, and any
danger of spoiling her milking quali
ties is prevented, which is very impor
tant if she is to continue to be a brood
sow.--Canadian Live Stock Journal
HERE AND THERE.
-Religion that will not improve a
man's domestic animals is not the right
sort for a farmer.
-WVood ashes is an almost universal
fertilizer, and yet it is a substance that
is piled out back of the smoke-house
for years, to become a total loss.
-No farm was ever properly stocked
with cattle alone, horses alone, or any
other sort alone. It can only be done
with a properly-adjusted variety.
-It is well enough to breed heifers
early to encourage the early habit.
But not so with bulls, for they should
be well matured and: vigorous for best
results.
-There is no money in putting extra
weight on hogs to be marketed in the
immediate future. Additional fat only
means a lower price as things are
now.
-Don't try to stimulate egg produc
tion with irritating condiments. They
do more harm than good. Plenty of
plain, wholesomne food is what is
needed.
-The poor man's cow is proverbially
a poor cow. but there is no reason why
it should be. It is just as easy, and a
great deal more profitable to have a
good cow than a poor one.
-A bridle recently invented for kick
ers is useful. It has rings for the reins
attached just below the rosettes, or
where the check loops up, and pulling
raises the horse's head higher and high
er so he can not kick.
-Any part of the farm, or any sort
of stock which is not profitable'is a tax
on all the rest of the farm. It should
be the aim of every farmer to make a
profit, be it ever so little, from every
department.
-Probably never before this year
were hogs turned into the wheat field
to harvest an abundant crop, and it is
to be hoped that this will never occur
again, if brought about by the low
price of that cereal. a
-Those who raise eggs for market
should keep but one breed: or if more
than one breed is kept, the eggs should
be carefully assorted as to size and
color. All white eggs or all tinted
eggs sell better than streaked lots.
"Looks go a long ways."
--Much can be learned by observing
nature. A horse will never stand fac
ing a wind in a pasture. but will al
ways turn his back. A horse heated
by driving can be foundered in a few
minutes by standing facing the wind
or in a draught.
--Tt is to be hoped that the experi
ment stations will give us more slaugh
ter tests of wheat-fed hogs. The low
price of wheat has opened a new field
for feeders, and thi stations can help
settle some of the questions which
have arisen in connection with it.
-If combined capital does not con
sider it advisable to crush them out of
existence. the cotton-seed oil mills now
operating in every locality where cot
ton is grown extensively will continue
to benefit the producer of cotton, while
remaining prosperous themselves.
--Many farmers breed horses to suit
their os-n prejudices, regardless of any
market value, while those who make
horse-breeding profitable breed for the
markets big, heavy draft horses or
large, stylish coachers. The grade
mares make the finest farm teams and
the geldings sell at top prices.
--Tt is said to be so dry in some parts
of the country that farmers have to
soak their pigs in the river before they
will hold slop. While it is hardly that
dry, yet this may serve to keep in mind
the fact that pigs should have more
liberal rations of slop or other feed
now that pastures are shortened by the
drought
-Europeans are enormous consum
ers of pork-when they can get it, as
they easily can in this country. The
European population of this country is
increasing rapidly. The profit of Irais
ing hogs depends largely upon the
number of consumers. These facts,
put together properly indicate that
hog raising will continue to be a profit
able recreation for progressive farmers.
-To raise good horses and keep them
looking well and in good life we must
not work the life out of them. es
pecially not load them too heavy.
That is what makes old horses out
of too many colts. Beeause they
are willing and walk right off we for
get and put on a heavy load. If we
would just stop and think, our ~udg
meant would tell us it was wrong.
