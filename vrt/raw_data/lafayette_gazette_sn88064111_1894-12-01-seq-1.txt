HONOR BRIGHT.
SWhere Her Honesty Was the Beet
Policy.
honor riight signed her name at the
end ef a school report which she had
)ust finished, and then, heaving a little
sigh, remarked to a companion who
sat at the desk near and was engaged
in a simii.r occupation:
"I almost regret sometimes that my
parents did not give me a different
name."
"Why?" was asked in surprise.
"Because the one they gave me
brought with it such a weight of ro
sponsibility. I feel that I must be
Honor Bright in nature as well as in
name."
"'Then I suppose I ought to have a
sticky, tobaccory natiline,"s the friend
rejoined,
Honor laughed merrily. "What can
you mean, Virgie?" she inquired, look
ing at her companion with eyes from
which the seriousness -had all de
parted.
"Why, don't you see?" she returned,
as she signed her name to the report,
"Virginia Spaulding Merrick. Vir
ginia savors of tobacco. I have seen
it hundreds of times on the papers
of tobacco that my father's workmen
have around them. And then of
course you have always heard of
Spaulding's glue. Isn't that name
sticky and tobaccory enough to dis
gust anybody? I'd leave out the
middle one-it's of no use-only Mr.
Harding insists on having it signed
that way."
They were. not fully fledged teach
ers these two young girls, but were
merely undergoing a six months' pro
bation at the training-school. The
rules there were very strict, and they
were anxious to comply with every
one; for they knew that their pros
pect of getting a position depended to
a great extent on the principal's
recommendation. At the end of the
six months there would be a vacancy
in one of the nearest schools, and that
was to be filled by the graduate having
tihe best record in the training depart
ment. Honor was exceeding'y anxious
for the position. l1er mother had
made many sacrifices to keep her at
school, and she wanted to relieve her of
expense as soon as possible.
"Why should you worry about living
up to your name?" Virgie went on.
"After all, there is very little honor in
the world, and those who are loosest
in regard to this matter get along
best, "I think."
Both were very serious now.
"Then you do not believe that 'hon
esty is the best policy,' " Honor asked
anxiously. She was beginning to love
this bright companion, although she
had known her only a few weeks, and
she was shocked to hear her express
such an opinion. She had been taught
to have the very strictest regard for
truth, and it pained her to find it lack
ing in others. Besides, Virgie was
such excellent company that she had
a decided influence over her friends,
and Honor feared what that influence
might be if the girl really felt the sen
timent that she expressed.
"Not a bit of it. Do you?" Virgie in
quired.
"Yes. 1 believe I do." Honor re
turned. "It seems to me that though
dishonesty may triumph for awhile,
like murder, it will out in t,.he end."
"I'm not so sure about that. Now,
for instance, we are supposed to be in
our classrooms at eight-fifty, and we
are expected to keep a true account of
the time that we enter. Yet I know
that many of the training-school girls
always put down eight-fifty whether
they are in their rooms at that time or
not. Isn't it policy for them to do it?
Who will be any the wiser? If they
were counted late it would go against
their record."
"I would rather be counted late than
dishonest," Honor answered, emphat
ically. "If no one else knew it I
should know it myself, and I prefer to
have a clear conscience. Arnd then I
think we can avoid either disgrace by
making an effort to be always early."
"But if you had to be late some
morning, what then?"
"1 hope I should be honorable enough
to mark it so, even though I suffered
in consequence. You would too,
wouldn't you, Virgie?"
"I don't know. The temptation is
so strong. But if you really feel this
way, why need you worry about being
like your name? You won't disgrace
that, with your principles."
"lBecause it seems to me that some
times it is so difficult to be strictly
true. 1)o you never, when off your
guard, find yourself saying something
that isn't exactly so, or exaggerating a
little, even without meaning to do it?"
"Well. now that you speak of it, I
remember that I have done so, but I
hardly think I should stop to worry
about it. Come, let us go; it is fotur
o'clock, and time we were at home in
stead of in these halls of learning.
Know you not at this hour the dig
nified mice do congregate and discuss
the mighty question of scattered
crumbs?" and Virgie Merrick sailed
out of the room with an air that com
pletely u'pset Honor's gravity.
As the weeks passed and the girls
became better acquainted Honor dis
covered that her new friend had a
greater regard for truth than would
appear by her remaxks. Once when
Virgie expressed a sentimentsimilar
to the.one mentioned in the beginning
of this story Honor remonstrated.
"''oa give people an idea that' you.
are not truthful," she said, "and yon
are as much so as anybody I know."
"Yes, I have been taught to be,"
Virgie responded, lightly; "but, mind
you, I can't admit yet that it ia~the
iest. policy, and if I were severely
tempted I don't know. what would be
the consequence." -
The end of the term had axrived.

'LAnd iwill you get me shoes like Ned

"Of course, if you like that kind

"And mamma a new dress? You
said so, you know, and I never told
that. sOcret. to anybody."
"Yes, rmamma a new dress, if-bun
there comes apy car, pet, and I must
catch that, or be late;" and in a few
moments U-nor wat seated by Virgie
in the car that had taken them for the
past six months to the door of the
trainling-school. -
"For the last time," they said gere
ly to each other; but their Laces
brightened with the thlought that their
recorid had been perfect.
'"The position is yours, without a
doubt," Virgie remarked, gayly.
"Why so? There may have been
others, and, besides, you stand the
same chance that I do."
"All the others have been either late
or absent, some both, I heard Mir.
larding remark to the commissioner;
and he also said that you were thebest
teacher in the training school. My!
what has happened'L I thought I was
in the middle of next week."
The exclamation was caused by a
sudden jerk of the car, which made
nearly aill of the standing passengers
lose their equilibrium Then there
was another which gave everybody a
hard shake, and the car stood still
with one end considerably highe s
than the other.
"We're off the track, and no mis
takes" remarked Ilonor. "I hope we
are not kept late; that would be a ca
tastrophe. hlow the car is packed this
morning. Are any of the other girls
here? Yes, there is Annie Hunter."
"If it weren't so far we might get
out and walk," said Virgie.
"That would hardly do any good, for
the car would overtake us. See, the
men are getting out to help, and is
will soon be on the track now."
But it was an ugly hole that the
wheel bad gone into, and it required
much tugging, pulling, lifting and
shoving, to get it in plane agein. The
girls waited anxiously, and every
minute seemed an hour.
"Do you think wd would be excused
if we were late?" asked Honor. "This
isn't our fault."
"I don't know. Once when Mary
Ridley was late and she blamed the
ear for it, Mr. Harding said she ought
to have tawen an earlier one and made
allowance ter delays."
But finally the car was in place and
wasrush ing along as if trying to make
up for lost time. It re.ached the school
just as the nine o'clock bell stopped
ringing, and by the time the girls
reached the principal's room, where
the record book was kept, it was five
minutes past nine by the clock.
•"MIr. Ilarding isn't here," said
Virgie, hurriedly, and ii: a low tone.
"Don't spoil your record, Honor.
Think how much depends on it. Put
down eight-flfty. I'm going to. He'll
never know, and we can hurry to our
rooms before he gets upstairs. Ve
couldn't help the delay of the cars."
Honor went up to the principal's
desk followed by her friend. She
opened the time book, picked up a
pen, and then hesitated. As Virgie
had said, so much depended on this
record. The girl thought she had
never been so sorely tempted. Would
it be very wrong to yield just once?
She had counted so much on getting
the position. l'or little Ned's sake,
for her mnother's sake-and yet it was
that mother who had taught her to
love the truth.
"1 can t do it, dtear," she said, with
tears in her eyes. "'it must go against
m.e," andl she wrote dlown "1:05."
T''hen Virgie took the pen. She
meant to save her own record, any
how. She had started from the house
at the usual time. and would have
been in school early but for the car.
She 'lipped her pen in the ink, and
then her real sense of right and her
friend's inl.tience won the victory, and
she, too, wrote down: "9:05."
Honor gave a sigh of relief.
"After all, more depends on our be
ing true," she said, with a sweet
smile, and they slipped away to their
rooms.
At 10:30, the time of the morning re
cess, Mr..Llarding called a meeting of
the teachers.
"Young ladies." he said, "I have
been looking over the records this
morning, and I find that two of you
have been perfect with the exception
of to-day's time. That lateness will be
excused. It was caused by the car
getting off the track, and it was off
long enough to make the excuse a
legitimate one. I know, for I was on
the back platform of that car and had
to hoelr lift it on the track. In cases
wheie a littlc delay has been said to
cause lateness, and I have inquired
into the matter, I have discovered
that the tardy teacher had taken a
late ear, andl I could not excuse her

lie stopped a moment here and ex
amined the record more closely. "Miss
Hunter, I thought you were on that
car?"' he. continued, in an inquiring
tone.
"I-I--ivas," she stammered.
"Then will you please explain how
it is that your time is marked eight
fifty?"
The girl addressed looked "mbar
rassed and said nothing.
"You are all excused with the ex
ception,of Miss Hunter." Mr. Harding
added, gravely; and as the other girls
turried away Virfie took Honor's hand
and whispered: '

have saved me. I can thank you best. I
suppose, by admitting that 'honesty
is the best policy,' bhit I know you

A HOOSIER SNAKE STORI.
The Terrible Monster That Msade Jay Coan
ty Famou.
A recent' dispatch from Portland,
Ind., says: The torrid wreather of the
past few days has revived the memory
of Jay county's great serpent and re
fleshed. the many wild, weird tale8
oheeerning it.
Probably fifteen years have elapsed
since it was first seen in Richland
township. It was on a summer after
noon and a gang of men were engaged
with old-fashioned "cradles" harvest
ing grain. Near by the field where
they were at work ran a little brook;
lined on both sides With stubby wilt
lots; iong tangled grass and rank
i,eeds. During the afternoon a boy in
the party wandered down toward
this spot and was surprised al
most into speeehlessgess by seeing
a snake, whose dimensions were
to him simply mammoth, dragging its
sinuous length along with the rapidity
of a race horse. He gave the alarm. A
hunting party was organized in short
order and, armed with rifles, shotguns,
revolvers, hoes, spades and everything
available for weapons, the crowd start
ed on the hunt, but were unsuccessful.
The next day two hundred men joined
in the search, many of the men horse
back, with dogs of every kind follow
ing. With iuadaunted persistence they
beat to and fro through the bushes,
and at several times it was thought
that his snakeship had been sighted,
but the report proved false. All that
could be fotutnd was a wide track in the
blook's muddy bank and a furrow
through the fields of waving grain.
The disappointed hunters left for home,
and for years the snake was supposed
tobe a myth. Later, however, it bobbed
up again, and nearly frightened a man
out of his wits.
At the time the Lake Erie & West
ern Railroad Co. had a crew of men
at work tilling in a deep cut at Curtis
Hill, eight miles of this city. The
day was a torrid one. A short dis
tance from where the men were at
work cattle were quietly feeding under
the shade of some scrawny oaks. Sud
denly there was a commotion among
them, and with heads in the air, eyes
dilated and nostrils distened with fear,
they bellowed with fright and started
away at a more speedy gait than ever
was shown by a stampeded herd on the
prairies. One of the men who had
been noticing the cattle's queer ac
tions ran up on the bank and was al
most paralyzed at the sight which met
his eyes.
Twined about one of the oaks was a
huge serpent, whose coils enveloped
the trunk of the tree in a fold which
to man or beast would have proved a
fearful death. Its sides were dotted,
its vicious little eyes seemed to emit
flames of fire, and from the wide-open
mouth, with its rows of jagged teeth,
darted a long, red tongue.
The spectator was for the time being
motionless with fright, but when the
immense snake slowly unwound its
tortuous length and cast longing
glances toward him the power of loco
motion returned, and he ran as though
pursued by a legion of demons. Sum
moning help, he returned to the spot,
but the snake had vanished, and all
search failed to reveal it. To his com
rades he described it as fully for
ty feet long, with a body of
prodigious size. For days afterward
hogs and other small domestic animals
were missing in the neighborhood, and
mothers frightened their children into
a restless sleep by tales of the horrible
monster which would conic and devour
them in case they did not behave them
selves. -
The next place the snake put in its
appearance was out in Jackson town
ship. One dark summer night it fairly
terrorized a gypsy camp. The leader
of the gypsies told a graphic tale re
garding the event. He said that on
the night in question hir family and a
number of others on their way home
from Iowa to the gypsy queen's home
in Ohio camped near a little
creek. They had pitched their tents.
partaken of the evening meal,
and, were fast asleep, when the
neighing of the horses and the bark
ing of the dogs awakened them. Mea,
women and children alike were on their
feet in an instant, but through the
darkness nothing could be seen.
The dogs still kept up their turmoil
near the camp, but all at once there
was a hush. The frightened curs, with
tails between their legs. slunk to their
master's feet in a very agony of fright.
An instant later there was a rushing
sound, the horses tugged at and broke
their tethers, then sped away with loud
screams of terror that only a horse can
give. Huddled together the campers
waited, but it was not for long. Al
most immediately through the dim
circle of light cast by the smouldering
camp-fire, an immense serpent glided
swiftly, with its head fully ten feet in
the air, mouth wide open, and wicked
,yes snapping death and destruction.
Straight it made for one of the chil
dren, and it was almost in the cavern
ous jaws when the little one's mother,
her fears overcome by maternal love,
seized a brand from the campfire and
plunged it squarely into the serpent's
mouth. The surprised snake whirled
quickly, dashing everthing aside in its
wild course, and glided away in the
darkness.
Fo the gypsies until daylight was an
endless watch. It seemed as though
m6rning would never come, and the
first gray streaks of dawn. were hailed
with the joy that a prisoner hails deliv
erance. All the next day was spent in
hunting up their scattered horses.
Those who were in the camp that event
ful night had a ithrilling experience to
relate to Bohemian friends of thle bat
tIe with the great Hoosier snake.

Their Prey.
Oh, yes, there are fish that fly in the
air, and fish that dig in the mud, and
fish that travel for miles over the dry I
ground, and fish that climb trees. We
had all of them within a few miles of
bitr hoiied in Indit, il oite diedtidtioti ot
another; but more curious than any of
these were fish that we used often to
see in a large pool not far from the
house, out shooting their breakfast or
supper.
I had never heard of shooting-fish be
fore; but I have learned since then that
they are quite donimosi in many parts
of the tropics.
All that one had to do was to hide in
a quiet place on the bank early in the
morning or just before sunset, and they
were sure to come. They follow the
shore, where leaves and branches over
hang the water, for in hot countries
the flies and other insects are often
found resting on the lower side of the
letaves where it is cooler and where
they make a fine target for the shoot
ing-fish.
The fish swims along the surface till
he discovers a fly not more than five or
six feet away over the water. Then he
draws back a little, makes his mouth
into a curious tube, like a little blow
gun, and darts out a drop of water so
swiftly and so straight that he hits his
mark nine .times out of ten. He lies
perfectly still with his eyes fixed on
the fly. The drop of water hits him,
knocks him from the leaf, and spatters
over his wings so that for a momenthe
can not use them, and he falls toward
the water. If it is some distance the
fish knows that he may recover and es
cape before he reaches the pool, so he
makes a jump and catches the fly in
the air; but if he thinks it safe to wait
he will lie still till the fly strikes the
water. If he should happen to miss in
his first shot he will swim about to an
other position and try it again.
To see what would happen I once
fastened a live fly to the bottom of a
leaf about four feet above the water.
Very soon a finny hunter came along
and tried a shot at him. I never knew
before that a fish had any expression,
but there was surely a look of pro
found astonishment about that fish
when the fly failed to fall. He was so
sure he had hit him that he did not go
to a new position, but fired again from
the same spot. Then he swam a few
feet away and came back and tried
again. Then he grew excited and sent
drop after drop in a perfect volley.
Then, in utter disgust, he gave the
water a good slash with his tail and
swam away.
When I looked at the fly the poor
little fellow was completely covered
with water and actually drowned.

The First Marines.
The marines were first established in
1664, when a corps was formed to sup
ply trained sailors for the fleet. The
merchant navy at that time was not
large enough to supply the king's
ships, and the impressed men were in
general unruly. A certain number of
marines were therefore placed in each
ship to keep the crew in order. Thus
at first marines were trained sailors,
and not soldiers, although at that time,
and both before and after, the fighting
in men-of-war was done by soldiers.
No special regiment was set apart for
this duty, but sometimes one and some
times another was employed. The duke
of York (afterward James II.) was in
command of a regiment which was for
some time employed in this way.

minutes. Strain through a jelly bag,
boil up the juice, and skim thorough,
ly. It is now ready for the sugar, of
which about three pints should be
added to each two quarts of juice. It
is then to boil for ten minutes, after
which it is ready to be sealed up and
put away.-Good Housekeeping.
-Canned vegetables can now be had
in perfection. They are much cheaper
than meat, and should be used even
more than they are. They improve in
flavor if opened an hour or two before
being used, but should be immediately
turned out of the can, as the action of
the air may render them poisonous.
A richer succotah than the canned can
be made by soaking dry Lima beamn
two hours in cold water, then draining
this off and adding fresh, in which they
should be cooked until tender. Then
add sufficient canned corn to suit the
taste, season with butter, salt, pepper
and cream.
WATERPROOF GARMENTS.
The Long Sleeveless Cleak Very nuch la
Demand Just Now.
The favorite in these garments is the
long sleeveless cloak that will go over
the large dress sleeve without spoiling
it. Over this is a long cape, plain, and
not very full. This combination i4
most excellent, leaving the arms free,
and completely covering the entire cos.
tume. On some rain cloaks of this de.
scription two full collarettes are seen
others are plain.
Another style is the triple-top in.
stead of the plain, single cape. Some
of these show the capes quite long,
quite the length of the arm, while oth
ers, made like the Newmarket shape
for the long garment, reach only to the
waist.
The storm mantles, hanging in folds
from the neck, and covering the figure
completely, are not so well suited to
the purpose, but are preferred by many.
The ornamentation consists of a collar.
ette, usually of the umbrella style.
which seems appropriate in a storm
cloak. Still another style shows a
loose front. with fitted back, and pelisse
sleeves.
The double-breasted Newmarket
storm cloak is made with generous
sleeves, and is quite a smart-looking
garment.
The mackintoshes of cloth, rubber
lined, show the usual checks, stripes
in plain grays, browns, blues and
blacks.
The cravenette cloaks are rather
more comfortable than these last men.
tioned, not overheating, as the rubber
does, when worn for any length of
time. The same shapes prevail in this
material, as also in the rubber cloaks,
cloth stamped.
Cravenette may be had for one dollar
and seventy cents per yard. and as a
garment may be made from four and a
half yards and upward, it results in
quite a saving if made at home, and
one may have a little more originality
in this garment. Stormproof serges
tnd cheviots are less expensive and are
most serviceable storm cloaks, answer
ing for traveling as well, and also for
cold days.-N. Y. Advertiser.
JUST BEFORE RETIRING.
ifew to Insure Icectul Peafl adRtreslalng
Slumber and a Sweet Mouth.
A warm bath, a ligh lunch. and a
clean mouth before retiring are good
things to take. They promote sleep
and a "clean" tongue in the morning.
What this lunch should be the con
sumer must decide. The juice of a
couple of oranges, half a grape fruit. a
cup of tea with dry toast, a sandwich
and glass of ale, cup of hot bonillon,
biscuit and a glass of sherry, crackers
with milk and vichy, or a bowl of
bread and milk are the choice of as
many different people, all healthy and
handsome.
The best thing in the merning after
ae cold plunge or sponge bathl is a cup
of hot tea or coffee with a little lemen
juice. The earlier this draught is
taken the better: it should precede
the breakfast by at least half an hour.
This is prime for the alimentary canal;
it is a comfort to the stomach, and puts
the digestive organs in order. A cup
of hot milk is also prescribed, and even
hot water the first thing in thie morn
inug is not dad. For anything but thq
Sabusive cup of cold water the poror
stomach will be grateful. If an appe
tite for breakfast in wanted, and tlhe
time permits. take a walk to the cor
ner, alone. inhaling and forcibly ex
haling the air through 'the nostrils.

--The summer school of Cornell uni
versity was attended by nearly three
hundred students many of whom were
public school teachers fitting them
selves for a more intelligentprosecution
of their school work. The school had its
origin in a private enterprise of 'a few
professors and instructors in 1892, whose
courses were attended by eighty per
sons. Last year the attendance rose
to one hundred and sixty-nine, which
was so encouraging that the university
decided to conduct the school under its
own auspices.
-The Ohio Wesleyan university has

-One meets here and there at sum
mer resorts well-dressed young men
'vith delicate hands and the air of
knowing what comfort is, who come
from one or another Methodist theolog.
ical seminary anduconduct service in
some hotel parlor on Sunday. The'
striking thing about these young men
to those that know the history of
Methodism is the contrast between.
their ease, outward grace, and 'air of
worldly knowledge and the rugged
plainness of the old-time Methodist
licentiate or lay preacher.
THE MINUTE WAS UP.
But the Fedler Got Mad and Wouldn't
Sell at Any Price.
Lawyer-Don't you see I am about to
go out? If you have any business with
me you'll have to call during office
hours.
Pedler-Isn't this one of your office
hours?
"No, sir."
"-All right. I'll take a minute of it.

thing you need in the way of pocket
combs, toothpicks, hairpins, cuff but
tons, key-rings, pencils, pens, ink. pa
per or jewsharps, here's your chance.
I call your attention to a neat little
device that's a whole box of tools in
itself. Opened out in this style it's a
corkscrew. Folded up again and opened
at the other end it's a screw-driver.
By pulling out this little ar
rangement. as you see, and ad
justing it in this manner, it be
comes a pair of dividers. Restor
ing it to its original shape and
pressing a little spring right here on
tmhe back-don't be in a hurry; yon
haven't seen half its good points yet
it resolves itself into a six-inch rule on
one side and a penknife on the. other.
Pull out this :small lever and you have
a handy nut-cracker. Here on the end
is a handle for the insertion of this lit
tle file that lies snugly concealed along
the side. By successive changes this
wonderful little implement can be
made into a match-box, a wrench, a.
gimlet. a lamp chimney cleaner, a pair
of tweezers"-
