Sarsaparilla
Is widely known
" as one of the most

and purifjying the
blood.. It has
stood the test of
years, with a con
stantly growing
reputation, based on its intrinsic virtues,
and sustained by its remarkable cures.
So mild as to le safe and benelicial to
children, anti yet so searching as to
ellectually purge cut the great corrup
tions of the blood, such as the scrof
ulous and syphilitic cntaunination.
Impurities or diseases that have lurked
in the system bfor years soon yield to
this powertihl antidote, anu diaplear.

which are publicly known, of Scrotialit,
and all scrofiulous discases, Ulcers,
Eruptions, and etuptive disorders of
the skin, Tumors, Blotches, Boils,
Pimples, Pustules, Sores, St.
Anthony'i Fire, Rose or Ery
sipelas, Tetter, Salt RIieuttm,
Scald Head, Ringwvormn, and in
ternal Ulcerations of the Uterus,
Stomach, and Liver. It also cures
other complaints, to which it would not
seem especially adapted, such as Drop
sy, Dyspepsia, Fits, Neuralgia,
Heart Disease, Female Weak
ness, Debility, and Leucorrho a,
when they are manifestations of the
scrofulous poisons.
It is an excellent restorer of health
and strength in the SprinL,. Bi renew
ing the appetite and vigor of the diges-'
tive organs, it dissipates the depression
and listless lannruor of the setson.
Even where no disorder appears, peoile
feel better, and live longer, for cleansing
the blood. The system moves on with
renewed vigor and a new lease of life.

Ayer's Ague Cure,
For Fever and Ague Intermittent Fe
ver, Chill Fever, aemittent Fever,
Dumb Ague, Periodical or Bilious Fe
ver, &o., and indeed all the affections
which arise from malarious, marsh, or
miasmatio poisons.
No one remedy is louder
called for by the necessities
of the American people than
a sure and safe cure for
Fever and Ague. Such
we are now enabled to offer,
with a perfect certainty that
it will eradicate the disease, and with assur
ance, founded on proof, that no harm can
arise from its use in any qulntity.
That which protects from or prevents this
disorder must be of immnense service in the
communities where It prevails. Prerention
is better than cure; for the patient escapes the
risk which he must run in violent attacks of
this baleful dit:ttlmper. This "C-r:r" expels
the miasmatic poison of F'evcr and Agme
from the system, and prevents the develop
ment of the disease, if taken on the first
approach of its premonitory symptoms. A
great ulperiority of this remedy over any
other ever discovered for the speedy and cer.
tain cure of lnterniltents is, that it contains
no Quinine or niuneral; consequently it pro.
dluces no quilnisi or other injurious effects
nhatever upon tihe col:stitution. Those cured
by it are left as hcalty as if they had never
had the disease.
* lerer and Agrue i.s not alone the con
sequence of tihe miula-:iti, poison. A great
variety of disorlders arise froln its irritation,
among which are Weara1lgu, Ithenma.
isasm, Gout, Hleadache, llindness,
Taootsanche, Earache, Catarrh. Asth
ma, Palpitation, Painfual Atffection
of the Spleen, lfysterice, Paia Is the
Dowels. Colic, Pariyalysi, and derange
ment of the Stonmeh, all of which, when
originating in titis cause, put on the inter
hnittent type, or become periodical. This
"Cuan" expels the poison from the blood,
and consequently cures them all alike. It is
an invaluable protection to immigrants and
persons travelling or temporarily residing in
the malarious distrits. If taken occasion
ally or daily while expoued to the infection,
that will be excretetd rom the system, and
cannot accumulate in sufficient quantity to
ripen into diseie. Hlence it is even more
valuable for protection tihan cure; and few
will ever sutrer from Intermittents if they
avail themselves of the protection this rem.
edy affords.
For Liver Complaints, arising from torpid
Ity of the Liver, it is an excellent remedy,
stimulating the Liver into healthy activity,
and producing many truly remarkable cures,
whbre other medicines fail.

Grateful Thousands proclaim
VINEGAR BIT'TERS the most wonder
ful Invigorant that ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, enmittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, Jamns, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumni, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful intiwunce upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Dit. J. WAILKEIR'S VINEGAR
B1i-"rl:as, as they will speedily remove
the darlk-clored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
VINF.GAa BITTTrI:a. No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus tire-armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, Head
ache, Pain in the Shoulders, Coughs,
Tightness of the Chest, Dizziness, Sour
Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste
in the Mouth, Bilious Attacks, Palpita

Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are the offsprings of Dyspepsia. One bot

merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrofula, or King's Evil, White
Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled

Indolent Inflammlations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WALKR'S VYIN
EA R 13rTERS'I have shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
:Rhleumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.-Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to par:'alysis of tile Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of WAL~aK's
V\ saoAa BI'-rETs occasionally.
For Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt- Kheum, Blotches, Spots, Pim
ples, Pustules, .UJils, Carbuncies, Ring
worms, Scald-head, Sore Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurt:, Discolorations of the
Skin, HIumors and Diseases of the Skinof
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelminitics will free the
system from worms like these Bitters.
ForFemale oomplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
womanhood, orthe turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
