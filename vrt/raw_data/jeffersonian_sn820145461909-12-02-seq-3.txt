RESOLUTIONS OF LOCAL FARM
ERS’ UNION FROM TAYLOR
COUNTY, GA.

the few; therefore,
Resolved, That we are unalterably
opposed to a Ship Subsidy.
And whereas, in order to more
fully control the money of the coun

ly opposed to any further destruction
of said greenbacks.
Resolved, That a copy of these
resolutions be furnished the Union
News and Jeffersonian for publica
tion.

TEXAS UP-IN-ARMS AGAINST
THOSE GALVESTON RESO
LUTIONS.
Resolutions passed by Hill City
Lodge 1376, in regular session No
vember 18, 1909:
Resolved, That this Union wants
to put its members on record as be
ing unanimously opposed to the reso
lution passed by the Farmers’ State
Union at Galveston, Texas, last Au
gust, favoring what they were pleas
ed to call the Merchant Marine; in
reality it is the Ship Subsidy steal.
Resolved, That we condemn this
arbitrary act, assuming so much au
thority on such important legislation
without giving any previous notice
to the rank and file of our member
ship; we deem it an outrage on the
good name of our order.
Resolved, That we thank the edi
tors of the Dallas News, Houston
Post, Jeffersonian, Graphic Demo
crat, for their exposure and timely
warning.
Resolved, We ask that the mem
bership of the Farmers’ Union
throughout this grand old State of
Texas rise up as one man and as
sert your rights to be heard on this
very important question before we
try to get our Representatives in
Congress to commit themselves to
any such legislation.
Resolved, That we ask our State
president, Bro. Loudermilk, to give
us a Referendum vote on this ques
tion.
Resolved, That we endorse a reso
lution that was passed by Wesley
Local Union No. 76, of Taylor county,
Georgia, that we are unanimously op
posed to sending representatives to
the meetings of any organization that
will not seat an actual farmer.
Resolved further, That we ask our
officers, State and National, when
necessary to employ legal counsel to
select only those whose character is
beyond suspicion, and who are in
sympathy with the Union.
Resolved, That these resolutions
be spread on our minutes, and a
copy sent to each of the following
papers for publication: Houston
Post, Dallas News, Graphic Democrat
and Jeffersonian.
Fraternally submitted.

RESOLUTIONS FROM KELLY
CREEK LOCAL.
Resolved by Kelly Creek Local
Union No. 443, Carroll county, Ga.,

mously condemn the Ship Subsidy
bill that the money power of our
United States is trying to place on our
people, and ask our Senators and
Congressmen of our respective dis
tricts to vote against said bill. We
ask all Local Unions to endorse the
same, and pass resolutions to that
effect. We also request our Secre

tions to the Farmers’ Union News

OPPOSED TO SHIP SUBSIDY.
Editor Co-Operator:—l will under
take to write a few lines to let the
readers of your paper know what this
part of Montague county thinks of
this Merchant Marine business. The
secretary part of Montague coun
ty union thinks that the Merchant
Marine under a ship subsidy is a bad
thing for the farmers who have to
pay the subsidy. We object to be
ing made to pay the State Steal Com
pany millions of dollars out of our
U. S. Treasury as subsidy for doing
our ocean-going business.
Maybe I had better explain what
I mean by the State Steal Company.
We just simply mean those that
steal from us directly or indirectly
through ship subsidy or any other
way, we mean the ship subsidy steal
er or any other kind of a stealer. The
big exchange stealer steals our cot
ton and he is not the only one that
steals cotton from us either. We
could mention others who live closer
to us who are equally as guilty and
there are many other kinds of steal
ers. But this ship subsidy fellow is the
boldest stealer yet. They thought
that the infamous navigation laws
would forever fix the thing for them,
but they now find that they are beat
at their own game and they must have
a —well, they call it a Merchant Ma-
Jeffersonian
rine law, but it is a ship subsidy that
they want, no matter what they call
it.
They have gall enough to come
down here to our State union at Gal
veston and call it a Merchant Marine
and “woolgather” that convention
and get their endorsement to the in
famous thing. We believe that con
vention was composed of honest, hon
orable farmers, but they did not un
derstand this thing and allowed them
selves to be misled. We don’t be
lieve that such schemers should be
allowed admittance into our conven
tion, for they always have an axe to
grind. But I want to say right here
that the Farmers’ Union is beginning
to have some power and influence and
no one knows it better than the
schemer does, and when he wants a
measure passed in Congress he gets
mighty friendly with the Union.
Hence his appearance at the Galves
ton State Union, and he is going to
continue to appear as long as he is
admitted and is as successful as he
was at the Galveston State Farmers’
Union.
The secretary part of this county
union is opposed to letting “’em” in
any more. Now, brethren, let us in
vestigate this ship subsidy or Mer
chant Marine, as they call it, and see
if we are willing to pay millions of
our dollars out of the U. S. Treasury
just to have the Steal Company build
our ships and to have “Old Glory
float over them.” The secretary part
of the union is not. Hoping to hear
from others on this matter I am,
Yours truly,
J. N. HAMILTON.
Montague County.
COMPARES FARMERS’ UNION TO
ALLIANCE.
Dear Sir: —The Jeffersonians are
splendid. I wish that I could put
both of them into the hands of every
family in this State.
The Farmers’ Union is not edu
cating the people on economic ques
tions like the Farmers’ Alliance did.
We have no little leaflets scattered
among the people now as we had
then. Something is the matter. All
the people want is some education
on political policies,—then they
would vote and act right.
I wish you would get Mr. Hollo
way, or some of our good Georgia
friends, to send me two or three
copies of the following books, “If

As to the Farmers’ Union. The

the fact a few such would-be bosses

To Our Florida Agents
Mr. R. C. Johnstone, of Ocala,
Fla., who has been for many years
manager of the Crew Levick Co., of
Philadelphia and Liverpool, England,
has accepted the appointment of
State Manager of The Jeffersonians
for Florida, and will have entire
charge of all subscription and circu
lation work in that territory. We ask
our friends and agents to give Mr.
Johnstone their active co-operation.
We were very fortunate to secure
the services of such an able repre
sentative of our interests, and we
feel that by the appointment of Mr.
Johnstone in Florida, and Mr. J. J.
Brown in Georgia, our circulation in
those States is now going upwards
by leaps and bounds.
