Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
e stable preparation, made chiefly from
8 the native herbs found on the lower.
Sranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
1 properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
s " What is the cause of the Unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
s. ERns t" Our answer is, that they
e remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
e are the great blood purifier and a
i- life-giving principle, a perfect Keno
Is vator and Invigorator of the system.
r Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
3- sessing the remarkable qualities of Va-s
4, EGA l BrrERas in healing the sick of
i- every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
º- relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
1. Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALK
Kn's VYixsaa BrrrTas are Aperient, Dia
s, phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laza
