Mr. T. M. Biossat, the popular

made to -his store, which has en
hanced the already neat plcce.
The town has been liberally billed
with fine lithographs, of the Sam T.
Jack's Creole Beauties, which show

Mr. Denis Long, owner of the
Long plantation near this town,died
in Louisville, last Sunday. He was
a prominent business man in the
city where he died.
W. H. Harris promises that his
Nickle-Plate Show, which will ex
hibit here on the 18th, has had
many features added, and is to-day
the best circus on the road.
No doubt a large- crowd will go
to the circus on the z8th. This is
claimed to be one of the best shows
for the price of admission asked,
of any traveling to-day. Don't
miss it.
SMesdames H. L. Monnier and
Eraste Mouton, solicited subscrip
tions this week for the storm snf
ferers, and realized $45.30, which
sum was turned over to Rev. Forge
who has forwareed same to Rev.
Bogaerts in New Orleans.
Mrs. Hilaire Lacobie, a lady
living near Scott and said to be in
sane, was brought to town one day
this week, and will undergo an ex
amination to ascertain her mental
condition.
The many merchants that we
have conversed with tell us that
business has beeni very fair for the
past ten days, and is creeping up
all the time. Within the next few
days it is anticipated it will be de
cidedly brisk.
The Sheriffs of the State will meet
to-day, at 4 p. m. at the court house
to perfect the association, the detalis
of which have been mentioned in
these columns. It is intended to
give them a magnificent reception
anld banquet. To-morrow they go
to the Salt Mines on a train kindly
furnished by the railroad company.
A Doctor Nelson, a traveling
medlicine man, with his assistants,
have been giving entertainments at
Falk's Opera House every night
during the week, and charging an
admission fee of ten cents. Quite
large numbers of people have been
attending the entertainments.
The Gazette has been made the re
cipient of an invitation to attend
the mawriage of Miss Leila, daugh
ter of M1r. and Mrs. T. S. Single
ton, to Dr. P. M. Girard. The
ceremony will take place at the
Methodist church, in this town, on
the 17th inst., at 12 o'clock. The
Gazette begs to tender congratula
tions, and at the same time returns
thanks for the invitation.
Sam T. Jack's 50 Creole beauties
will give one of their fine entertain
ments at Falk's Opera House next
Thursday. This company don't
play small towns, and the only rea
son that they stop over in Lafayette
is to fill up a week left open by
reason of a mistake made in making
up the circuit.
Four young men, the names of
whom we failed to ascertain, created
a disturbance around the hall at
Scott, while the theatrical perfor
mance was going on last Saturday,
were arrested and brought before
a justice of the peace, who placed
them under a $50 peace bond, and
condemned them to pay costs.
The Gazette is exceedingly sorry
to learn that Mr. F. Mouton had sent
in his resignation as a member of
the council. Mr. Mouton was a useful
member of that body. And had
his many friends the slighest intima
tion that he meditated such a step,
they would have insisted that he
remain in the council. It is to be
hoped that his successor will -prove
to be a man of the same sterling
qualities.
On the occasion of the anniversa
ry of her birthday, iittle Miss Marie,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Emile
Mouton, invited' her young friends
to the home of her parents, where
they had a nice little party. Those
present were: Celeste and Rita
Lafond, Clara and Bertha Hebert,
Lizzie and May Bailey, Pauline
Genkendoff, Medora Lindsey,
Eloise Mouton, Marie and Alma
Thompson. Of course, they all
vÂ·owed they- had jus~t lots of fun.
ASPENIDID EVENT.
The First Entertainment of the
Scott Dramatic Association
a Decided Success.
The people of our neighbor Scott,
some time since, organized a dram
atic club and at once put into re
hearsal a French play, which was
presented last Saturday to a large
and appreciative audience, number
ing, at a low estimate, 350 persons.
The play was most admirably
carried out in all its demands; the
parts were well sustained; and some
of the cast showed fine dramatic tal
ent for amateurs, so much so that it
would be invidious to particularize.
Before the raising of the curtain
Julian Mouton, president of the
School Board, was espied in the au
dience, and was called upon for an
address. Mr. Mouton responded
and made some remarks thanking
the Scott Dramatic Club for their
kindness in tendering the profits
of the entertainment to the Lafa
yette High School, and incidentally
spoke on the importance of educa
tion to the masses. Though brief,
his remarks were a popos, and
evoked approbation as attested by
the liberal applause given.
The rising of the curtain pre
sented the prelude and disclosed
some twenty persons grouped in a
manner pleasing to the eye, and
they rendered the opening chorus
very effectively.
Then followed '"La Rose Jaune"
a very prettily worded comedy, with
just plot enough to make it interest
ing. As we said before, this play
was well rendered. Below is the
cast in full:
Mr. Randeul.................Ned Mouton.
Tessier................ .Simon Boudreaux.
Mr. Simar ........Chas. A. Bodtlreaux.
Gros-Pierre. ............ Louis Dubernard.
Mme. Simar......Melle. Adele Delhomme.
Francine...... ....... Aurore Dubernard.
Following the dramatic piece,
Mr. H. Van der Cruyssen favored
the audience with a French song,
which was well received, Miss
Louise Bendel playing the accom
paniment.
Upon request, Miss Emma Falk,
the gifted daughter of our fellow
townman, Mr. B. Falk, appeared
on the stage and her appearance
elicited applause of the most cheer
ing and unanimous description.
She sang in a bewitching, melodious
voice, "He Told Me So." At its
conclusion, a burst of applause re
sounded and was prolonged until
Miss Falk was compelled to respond
to an encore-in this she excited
the admiration of the audience.
She possesses not only a fine voice
and sings exquisitely, but has
marked histrionic .powers.
Then followed a ball, the music
of which was furnished by the well
known Landry String Band.
The public interested, but more
particularly the people of Lafayette,
owe grateful thanks to the Scott
Dramatic Club for their kindness
in donating the proceeds of this en
tertainment to the High School
Fund. It evinces such unselfish
ness that it is all the more to be ap
preciated. The Gazette takes the
liberty to extend the warmest thanks
of the people of the town of Lafa
yette to this most worthy and ex
cellent organization.
The net proceeds amounted to
the handsome sum of $69.75.
Grand Ball.
The Gazette is requested to state
that a grand ball will take place at
J. O. Broussard's Hall, on Satuir
day, Oct. zi, for the benefit of the
Broussardville String band. The
dancing music will be furnished by
the excellent Decuir. String Band
of Loreauville. Every one is in
vited to attend, and knowing that
the gentlemen at the head of the af
fair have always been very success
ful in giving fine balls, this one will
be no exception to the rule. A fine
time is in store for those who may
attend.
An Enoch Arden.
Thirteen years ago, Emile Mas
son left his family-wife and several
children-in Jeannerette, and de
parted ostensibly for Lake Charles,
but his trip took him to the frontier
of Texas, and many other places.
and he became a rover for these
many years. Time passed, years
followed years, and his family not
receiving a word from him, or hear
ing of his whereabouts, concluded
that he had died among strangers
without disclosing his identity. So
impressed his wife was with this be
lief that she remarried, and moved
to this parish. His several daugh
ters, grown to womanhood,marridd,
the several families apparently liv
ing contentedly, when, some three
weeks ago, this modern Enoch Ar
den, after an absence of thirteen
yearTS, s11iddenlvl appears on the
scene. 'The meeting and explana
tions that followed are left to the
imagination of the reader.
Manager Falk has made a ten-strike in se
curing for the opening of the seeson Sam T.
Jack'sdfamous Creole Burlesque company,
the only-one of its kind in existence, and
which will appear on the 19th. Not only
are both company and program thoroughly
unique, but the entertainment itself is unra
valled in all the wide field of burlesque.
There are no waits, pauses, or delays, from
start to finish; the show is bright, lively,
spicy, and yet, so declare the manager of the
troupe, free from impropriety in any form.

Carencro News.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
Mr. Claude Latiolais, formerly of
Broussardville, is residing now in
Carencro, and is principal of St.
Peter's parochial school. We wel
come Mr. Latiolais, and trust that
he will be pleased with our place
and people.
-Several men, all strangers, got
into a difficulty near the depot, last
Sunday. One was knocked down,
and had his leg broken. The two
men who were accused of making
the assault made their escape. Dr.
Courtney attended the wounded
man. Several charitable citizens
contributed an amount sufficient to
defray the man's expenses to the
hospital in New Orleans.
-Carencro is booming, and no
mistake about it.
-Kennedy & Foote have a large
force of men at work, rushing the
track-laying on the Teche railroad,
and with a continuance of good
weather and proper supply of mate
rial, there is every reason to believe
that the road will be completed to
the Teche by the s5th of this month.
-The members of the congrega
tion of St. Peter's church, and their
good pastor, Rev. La Forest, are
making preparations for a Fair which
is to take place during the early
part of next month, given for the
purpose of raising funds for a new
church, which is sadly needed-the
present one being a mere barn in
appearance, and far too small to ac
commodate the present large con
gregation. There is no doubt that
all will do their utmost to aid such
a worthy object, which, when ac
complished, will prove a source of
pride to themselves, and an im
provement to our town.
-Cadet S. P. Brown has return
ed to the State Univetsity at Baton
Rouge. Sam will be missed greatly
by his many friends.
-Cotton is being ginned here,
hauled from points as remote as
Scott, Lafayette and Grand Coteau.
-Mr. Lobdell, a guest of Mr.
L. G. Stelly, has been looking
around Carencro the last few days,
with a view of purchasing a place
and locating near our town. 11e
