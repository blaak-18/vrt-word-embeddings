Summary of Events
The war between the Reds and
Blues is over, and Boston is “theo

Fight. army of invasion.
All the week ma-
neuvers have been in progress be
tween the two opposing forces, and
promptly to the minute the city of
Boston fell. What does it all mean?
Simply that the Blue and Red ar
mies are composed of United States
troops who have been forced to do a
tremendous amount of unnecessary
work in the interest of military silli
ness and probably to enable inter
ested parties to obtain choice con
tracts for putting in better defenses
for Boston. Obviously, if the city
can be captured theoretically, it could
be captured actually, and much
money should forthwith be expended
to prevent the dire catastrophe. In
cidentally, the maneuvers, under
the burning August sun and in tor
rents of rain, with men sleeping in
the mud and enduring every exposure
detrimental to health, will probably
largely increase the roll of dead or
permanently disabled. Stripped of
the gaud and tinsel the week’s man
euvers about Boston have been both
a cruel and a chuckle-headed per
formance.
Now that the South American
States are perfecting a union the out

nal authority of Great
Britain, the status of the black man
politically has become acute. With
scarcely an exception, the whites,
both Dutch and English, who are in
South Africa oppose the entrance of
the negroes into political life, but
there are plenty of sentimentalists
in the mother country, who, never
having seen a negro, perhaps, view
him as in all respects, save color,
equal to themselves. If these have
undue influence in shaping the poli
cies of the South African States there
will, of course, be much friction;
nut it is believed that wiser men will
leave to the people concerned the di
rection of this, one of their most vi
tal concerns.

“When we got there we were hus

give up our contracts. Then, at the
muzzles of guns held by guards, we
were put into a box car and locked
up. When the door was opened we
were in the Pressed Steel plant.
There we found out that our job was
to break a strike.
“We had to sleep on straw and eat
whatever they gave us. I saw sev

in the foot by a guard and left to lie
on the straw without attention.”
That is the story of one of the

to borrow money needed for the Han

France and Germany, after prolong
ed negotiations. When the loan was

greedy participants, vastly increased
the sum to be borrowed in order that
he might get his finger in the pie.
It is calmly stated that the interest
on this loan will be higher than the
investment would command in Eu
rope or America, and the whole
scheme reeks with spoilation and cor
ruption. The poor of our own gov
ernment are prostituted to the mon

have supinely submitted to shame

class can take their money and with
it bludgeon our government into obe

Minister Wu Ting Fang has been
recalled by the Chinese government,
presumably for his failure to protect
his government from the schemes of
United States financiers. Which is
exceedingly unjust, for how could a
Chinese minister succeed in getting
the government to consider the
rights of an alien people, when it is
utterly deaf to the claims of its own
poor and oppressed?

Remains to record yet another
victory in foreign lands for American
“interests” in the agreement by
Venezuela to settle the claims of the
United States and Bermuda Asphalt
Company by the payment of $475,-
000. This trust defied the govern
ment of Venezuela, under the ad
ministration of Cipriano Castro, in
cited the Matos rebellion, and gen
erally deserved to have its directors
jailed. Instead, after ousting Castro

and sick, the Gomez faction has yield

in the State of Arkansas, entered into
a rate combination, on Dec. 16, 1908.

of the third judicial district, filed

The item occasions no surprise.
Had it not been for the revelations
which shook the insurance world so
severely some years ago, a world
wide “insurance trust” would prob
ably have been in successful opera
tion today. If Attorney Jeffrey can
knock the combination out in his
State, he will have achieved a notable
victory in aiding to defeat a tendency
toward one of the most impregnable
mergers that could be formed.

West and South to get the political
“feel” of those sections. In this way,
the whole public has the pleasure of
paying long in advance a part of the
expenses of his second candidacy. Mr.
Taft is worried. He fears a disrup
tion of the G. O. P. and has the fa
tuous idea that he—Winsome Willie
—can woo the mutinous portions
thereof to genial acquiescence and
complete harmony. He has observed
that those Western Senators who
voted against the Payne-Aldrich
tariff abomination have reported no
casualties upon arrival at home. They
were not even seen nervously to
memorize an “explanation” to their
constituencies, but were welcomed
with a zeal about which was no
feigning. Mr. Taft will hardly re
ceive the same sort of a reception.
As the Chief Executive, with plenty
of patronage in his jeans to pay for
hospitality shown, he will probably
get enough to eat along the way, and
suffer no more of the general frost
than can penetrate to him through the
ranks of the invariable toadies; but

Mr. Taft also has a kind of family

while Pinchot wants them preserved

in saving them up for certain trusts,

eling expenses, generously
allowed him by an oblig
ing Congress from the
pockets of the people, in
taking a tour over the
man, and the fact' that Secretary
Wilson backs him up is in itself the
seal of an approval not to be under
estimated. In Mr. Ballinger, on the
other hand, the public has very little
faith.
At the National Irrigation Conven
tion at Spokane, recently, Mr. Pin
chot publicly charged that a water
power trust was forming and sounded
a warning against permitting the con
trol of valuable water-power sites to
pass into the hands of those sub
sidiary companies who form the basis
of what may be an ultimate fearful
monopoly. That Mr. Ballinger has
been benevolently disposed toward
these companies has been tolerably
plain, and, before the Spokane meet
ing, scandal was in the air. Mr. Pin
chot but voiced it plainly. The out
come will be a serious situation in the
Cabinet. If it results in the resigna
tion of Gifford Pinchot, Ballinger’s
triumph will be regarded as a victory
for the corporations he served and
will put the Taft administration more
than ever to the bad. If Mr. Pinchot
is sustained, it will be regarded as
both a personal vindication, and one
for his chief, Mr. Wilson, who the
people feel, as Secretary of Agricul
ture, is a faithful and efficient official.

A “central bank of issue”. The pres

not sufficiently glut the appetite of
the favored few money-manipulators
and panic-precipitators, and the
