WALL PARER JOURNALISM BEFORE TIIE
SURRENDER-MULE AND CAT MEAT.
[Vicksburg Herald.]
Some one sends us a copy of the i
Minneapolis (Minn.) News, of the e
25th inst., which contains the follow- I
ing reminiscence of the day of shot i
and shell and bellowing of the mor- n
tars:
Through the kindness of Mr. J. P. c
Ray, of this city,, we have examined e
quite a'newspaper Curiosity. It bears .
the title of the "Daily Citizen," and t
was published .in Vicksburg, Thurs- r
day, July 2nd, 163. It is printed on n
the blank side of a small strip of wall 1
paer. there' being four columns i of
reading matter on the shieet. It con
tains many interesting items, of. whichi
$e mqke extracts: ..
The editor, Mr. Swords, ackncsil- I
edgekthe receipt of a "mule steak," t
as follows: .
"We are indebted to Major Gilles
pie for a steak of Confederate beef,
alias mule mieat. We have tried it,
and can assure our friends that they
need have no scruples' at eating the
meat. It is sweet, savory and tender,
and so long as we have a mule left,
wa aresatisfied our soldiers will 'be
content to subsist upon it."'
Speaking of the scarcity 'of provi
sions in the city, of -their secretion
and sale to the half-starved citizens,
at exhorbitant prices, the "Citizen"
sap :
'A rumor has reached us that par- t
ties in our city have. been, and now
are, selling flour at five dollars ier I
pound, molasses at ten dollars a gal
ion, and corn at ten dolli'Ws per bushel.
We hope this :allusion to the ilbjekct
wvill induce some. one .to asiertain
upon whom rests this extortion, and
if so, let a brand qot only be placed
upon his biow;' but let it be eIared
into the very ibrain, that hbnnt nity t
may scorn and: shun them.. as they I
would the portals of hell itself." : 1

The Man who Swallowed an F
Aligator.
The Lyons (Iowa) Advl\ertiser of
the 12th says: We have read of
Jonah being smwallowed by the whale, die
and after ruminating and feaiting in ter
that aquatic animal for three days an
and. nights, was delivered safely on bu
dry land again, but nevelr before have have
we seen a man lwho collld swallow an th
alligator, and give him peaceful pos- of
session of his stomach for three years, foi
until we were introdiuced ye.stetlay st
to both the man and the alligator, all
at the rooms of Dr. Gannon, in Clin- bit
ton. The victim of this monstrosity CIo
is a tcolored man known by the name ets
of Thomas D. Gaines, a resident of tin
Clinton for more tha:1 six years, and mmi
fIacts "' .ti..i.Y.. 'loni.. rehated the als
felt something in my stonlac'h for pa
about three years which sometimes asl
made me very sick. I could not en- es
dure my clothes to be drawn tight in,
upon me. My stomach became very the
sore, and at times ejected a green ma
slime. During the last year or more er
I was obliged to get up at night and m:
drink milk to stop the raging in my the
stomach." This thiing, which is about de
four inches long;-yet neither beast, bt
bird nor devil, resembles the alliga- tra
tor, except the head, which is like that di
of a frog. It lha scales upon its en- tel
tire body and legs. It has also long he
claws with which, Tom says, it has
been seratebhing the very internals
out of him for three 'years. This pet -
of Tom's which is now corked up in of
a small jar, is tniqus the end of its co
tail. Tom says he ejected the tail of
after he- went home. These state Ti
meats are facts supported by aflida. b
vita, which are in our possession, of a se
number who were present when the hi
animal was ejected. :o

"Yes, fellow-citizens," says Gen. bi
Sherman at Bunker Hill to-day, "this gi
battle was a series of blnnders from ti

5 Halifax you are celebrating it for, I au
cant't for the life of me, see. [Cheers] is
There was Warren-Doctor Warren- a

oral for the occasion, and sent over tt
to superintend the battle. There wam at

A New Food for Horses and Sheep.
-A favorite and rather a new kind
of mash for horses is coming into use,
composed of two quarts of oats, ono
of brand, and half a pint of flax seed.
The oats are first placed in the stable
bucket, over which is placed the flax
seed; add boiling water, then the
bran, covering the mixture with an
old rug and allowing it to thus rest
for five hours; then stir the mass
well up. The bran absorbs while re
taining the vaper and the linseed
binds the oats and bran together. A
greater quantity of fla seed would
make the preparation too oily and
less relished. One feed per day is
sufficient. It is easily digestible and
is specially adapted to young poisnals
adding to their volunae rather than
to their height, giving substance to
the frame. Professor Samson reminds
us not to overlook the food, the nour
ishment question, in connection with
the amelioration of live stock. lie
considers oats, as so generally given
to sheep, as objectionable and ap
proaching the unprofitable. Rams
generall receive one pound of oats
daily, ewes half that quantity. Oats,
tot ming an -exciting food, are espe
cially suited for rams, daring the (Ma
son when they serve;.but for has
tening the development of young
sheep, they only build up the bones?
not the flesh.
And it is now an admitted fact that
small farms well cultivated, feneed
and fertilized, are vastly more profi
table prpport.ionuilyv.. than those of
large extent. It requires double the
mnnle and manual labor to cultivate
one bIndled acres, that would suffice
for fifty, and yet by coneentrating
the Ianure used for the fonner 'upon
the smaller area, nearly twice the
yield can be realized, and the land at
the same time will steadily improve.

the only thrifty anid progressive ag

their labors. These men raise their
own beef, bptter, nmutton, baecon and
vegetables, and oftimes, also sufar,
syrup, lice and flour. Moreoveir tr'eir

This assertion we are prepared to
prove by the evidence of hundreds
of svuall farmers, whereas, those cul
tivating large plantationu's with 'ex
ceptional and almost solitary irntan
ces to the contrary, make griavous
failures, anud grow poorer every year.
