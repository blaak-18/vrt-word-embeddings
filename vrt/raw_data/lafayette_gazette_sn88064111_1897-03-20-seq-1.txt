THE CENTURY CLUB.
Its Pirst Ananiversary Celebrated by
as Elegant Banquet at the
Cresceat Hotel
'he Century Club is. only one
' year old, but it is one of the most
'.lourishing organizations of its kind
:iio -be found in the State. This
: towi needed a social club for a
h g time and it is no wonder that
Sthe Century increased so rapidly in
popuilarity. The success achieved
by the promoters of the Century
Club has surpassed the most san
guine, expectations and if we are
permitted to judge the future by the
past it will not be long before Lafa
,ette will be able to boast of a
strictly up-to date club, possessing
every improvement necessary to
the pleasure and comfort of its
guests. In its well-furnished apart
inents are a fine piano, pool and
billiard tables, chess and checker
boards. For the benefit of those
who wish to read there is a variety
of papers and magazines. The
members are determined to make
the club first-class in every particu
lar ahd The Gazette entertains no
doubt that they will succeed. The
present officers of the club are:
President, Dr. F. E. Girard, vice
president, Hon. Wm. Campbell;
secretary, Dr. H. A. Irion; treas
urer, Mr. Jno. 0. Mouton; govern
ing board, T. M. Biossat, J. C.
Nickerson, H. A. Vandercruyssen.
The banquet given on the thir
Steenth, at .te Crescent Hotel, by
the tZentury.Club to celebrate its
first anniversary, was indeed a re
therche affair.
Promptly at 9:3o o'clock inspir
Ing strains of music issued forth
from the lower corridor and the
guests marched down the winding
stairs to the spacious dining-room,
which had been artistically deco
tatett with Flora's fairest offerings.
The table, arranged in horse-shoe
shape, was in itself a mute toast to
the Century Club.
Efficient waiters served an ele
gant supper of twelve courses and
sixty covers. Toasts were called
for and appropriately responded to
by Drs. Irion, Girard, Martin and
Mouton, Messrs. C. 0. Mouton,
Crow Girard, John Kennedy and
Prof. Trudeau.
The reception committee was as
follows; Mmes. Nickerson and
Enelly; Misses Louise Givens,
Bessie Cornay, Clye Mudd; Messrs.
N4ickeison, Clegg, Girard and Irion.
Too much praise cannot be given
the members of the Century Club,
also Mr. and Mrs. Hahn for the
admirable manner in which the
whole affair was conducted.
And though the banquet is now
linked by the guests in their chain
of yesterdays, it has not sunk into
oblivion for
*"You may break, yout may shatter, the vase
if you will,
but the scent of the roses will cling 'round
it still."

THE JAIL REPAIRS.
y A Serious Misunderstanding Between
the Contractors and the Parish
-An Amicable Adjustment
is Hoped For.
t The Police Jury met in special
1 session last Tuesday to consider a
s very serious misunderstanding rela
a tive to the provisions of the jail
"t contract in respect to the construc
1 tion of the three new steel cells.
The proposition upon which the
Y contract was awarded to the Pauly
Jail Building. Company was that
e three new steel cells should be con
e structed of keybar iron work as per
model exhibited to the Jury and the
a three old cells to be refloored and
g repaired so as to render them safe
5 for the detention of criminals.
s This in brief constituted the under
standing between the Jury and Mr.
F. B. Hull, the contracting agent
of the compan,. Recently it was
discovered that the contractors in
tended to consturct the three new
cells of flat bar iron work, using in
a part material taken from the three
old cells. Mr. Harmon, who -has
the work in charge, stated that he
e was simply carrying out the require
ments of of the contract specifica
tions and knew nothing of any key
bar work. The Jury unanimously
agreed that until a thorough under
standing should be obtained, no
further work must be allowed on
the cells, and appointed a commit
tee to meet the agents of the cori
- pany and affect an amicable adjust
Y mant of the difficulty. There is
s every reason to believe that an
agreement can be reachtd which
will be satisfactory to all concerned.
Agents of the company have wired
that the work should be properly
done and ordered further progress
G stopped. Mr. Hull is expected in a
few days when the entire matter
will doubtless be adjusted. The
trouble has arisen from the fact that
e the Police Jury and its representa
tives did not examine veiy closely
the specifications embodied in the
contract, relying with explicit con
fidence in the plans and specifica
I tions submitted by Mr. Hull, and
as explained by him to the Jury
I when that body was considering the
various propositions tendered for
d jail repairs. The matter is of a
serious nature and deserves caieful
s attention in order that the interest
i of the parish may be conserved.
The work in question is one of
the most important features of the
proposed repairs, and unless good
and substantial material is used in
the construction of these new cells,
e the parish jail will not be at all safe
C for the keeping of any criminals of
desperate character.
If no amicable adjustment can
be effected, it is highly probable
that the Jury will be called in extra
session and take further steps to
protect the public interest. There
d seems to be, however, a disposition
on both sides of the controversy to
11 arrange the unfortunate misunder
standing without- resort to legal
proceedings and this certainly
would be by far the most sensible
and honorable course to pursue.
- The Pauly Jail Company is a relih
able and responsible firm, and its
,f agent, Mr. Hull, during his short
Sstay here made many friends by his
Sopen and candid bearing in all
business matters.
T'he Gazette predicts that the
grave misunderstanding now exist
ing will be honorably adjusted in
, a few days and the jail repairs com
n pleted in a workmanlike manner
above any criticisms which certain
- parties are now so anxious to make.

DEMOC RATS
Hold a Meeting at the Court
hour:e - Stirring Addresses
Made by Local Speakers.
The Democrats of the town met
at the court-house Wednesday. A
large and representative gathering
of ladies and gentlemen made up
one of the best political meetings
ever held here. Mr. A. M. Martin
was elected chairman and Mr. Ben
Falk secretary. Messrs. Charles
D. Caffery, Julian Mouton, Ed.
G. Voorhies and I. A. Broussard
delivered addresses.
Much enthusiasm prevailed
throughout and the utterances of
the speakers elicited rounds of ap
plause. The cry against ring rule
raised by the opposition was the
subject of some very pertinent re
marks from the speakers. It was
evident that the audience was in
thorough accord with the speeches.
The people of Lafayette know a
thing or two about ring rule and
they are in a position to appreciate
the sincerity or rather the lack of
sincerity of those who would like
to make people believe that any
thing that smacks of ringism is
superlatively detestable to them.
If the esteemed gentlemen who
have recently bobbed up as enemies
of cliques would look back a few
years and ponder just a little bit
over municipal history, they would
not be so prone to make such ridic
ulous assertions and expose them
selves to the charge of insincerity.
You might as well try to con
vince an intelligent man that Boss
Tweed is the patron saint of re
formers, as to make the thinking
citizens of Lafayette believe that
the men responsible for the selec
tion of the "People's Ticket," are
engaged in the magnanimous pur
suit of devouring rings and cliques,
when it is a well-known fact that
for years they were the undisputed
heads of one of the most obnoxious
political organization that ever mis
ruled a community.
The startling announcement that
the meeting held at the court-house
on March I , was for the purpose
of nominating a municipal ticket
free from political entanglement and
"without regard to ring, clique or
gang-rule" was a masterpiece if it
was intended as a humorous produc
tion. The signers of this call are
undoubtedly good men, but we
would never have suspected that
they had concealed about their
persons any savage and uncontroll
able desire to reform the municipal
government of this town and to
cleanse our city hall of any political
impurity that may pervade the at
mosphere.
Mouton & Hopkins have received
a lot of nice matting, window
shades and curtain poles. Get
their prices.
Electric Bitters.
Electric Bitters is a medicine
suited for any season, but perhaps
more generally needed when the
languid, exhausted feeling prevails,
when the liver is torpid and slug
gish and the need of a tonic and
alterative is felt. A prompt u.e of
this medicine has averted long and
perhaps fatal billious fevers. No
medicine will act more surely in
counteracting and freeing the sys
tem from the malarial poison.
Headache, indigestion, constipa
tin, dizziness yield to Electric
Bitters. Soc. and $roo per bottle
at Clegg's Drug Store.
The property of the ILafayette
Sugar Manufacturing Compart was
sold at public auction last Satarrday.
It was bought by S. Gumble Co. of
New Orleans. This plant was
built through the energy of Col.
Gus A. Breaux and no matter who
becomes its owner it will serve as a
monument to that gentletuan's en
terprise and public-spirit.

While Budro's seven-foot kite
was in the air last week, with a
lantern attached, a friend coming
f in from the country observed this
strange meteor floating in the air,
stopped and was undecided whether
to pray or return home, but after
thinking over the matter, came in
slowly and was relieved on finding
it to be a kite.
Two of Brigham Young's apostles,
expounders of the Mormon church,
paid Scott a visit last Sunday night,
and the audience, though small,
was a very quiet one. The reason
for this quietness was that a
greater portion of the congregation
were soundly wrapped up in the
slumbers of Morpheus, "sleeping,
as it were." The converts were
scarce and we predict very little
success to our brethen. Some of
our people have all they can do to
support one better-half, and it
would be a task to support a dozen,
especially of the "new woman"
kind. King Solomon with his 6oo"
or more wives, did probably exist
in the dark ages, but at the present
time AMIornronism can thrive oaiy
among fanatics, whose sole object
is a soft living---the wives doing
the supporting. We would suggest
that our two brethen get acquainted
with our colored population and
probably they would succeed in
making converts, as Mormonism is
more or less practiced by them.
The sermon was a decided failure:
Farewell, brethen.
The farmers are busy putting
their farms in shape for the big
crop of '97. The farmers in getl
