lie came up the four pair f stairs
Saturday morning, and as sotn as he
had recovered his breath he =wanted
to know if the Free Press wo lI like
to engage another reporter. o said
he hadu't had much experien e, but
he said it in a tone which ant to
codnver the idea that he know is bu
siness. lie was tall and thin, had on
a plug hat which looked as it had
been run over by a drove of Dules,
his collar had sweat through ad his
bandana handkerchief was re arka
ble for the many crevasses in t. His
boots were red with old age, nd his
pants were stuffed into the ops.
Nevertheless, his face was ne to
command attention, and his tones
were respectful. In reply e was
told that there was always om at
the top of the profes.ion, ust as
Daniel Webster toWl a young lawyer
once upon a time. lie said he t ought
four stories high was about s near
the top of a profession as a fellow
could get, but his joke 'as to old to
laugh at. Ile didn't want mu *h pay,
he said, his object being to i entity
himself with some growing ournal
and let the fleeting years br ng him
wealth and laurels, lie was bt nine
teen years old, and he had p eoty of
time. He said he could sit up three
nights running, ingratiate hi elf in
to the affections of the polic in one
brief hourf and he knew the remen
and the captains of the fer -bcats
would love him on sight. H could
report anything, he said, fro a dog
fight to a regatta, and we rote a
lightning hand. ie was use to re
ligions meetings, knew all a t ned
ical conventions, and woul go for
woman suffrage or become a ranger,
just as the paper desired. pre
ferred, he said, to work all ay and
all night; but if the office h, a rule
requiring a man to sleep thr or four
hours out of the twenty- ar, he
would obey.
He promised much more, and his
tones grew more serious as h talked.
He was being consumed by a buro
ing ambition to wield a le -pencil,
and fire-water had no fef upon
him. He was "up" in gram r, post
ed in poets, and as for hisry, he
could repeat every importan event
from the hour the boy at on the
burning deck down to Eli erkins'
fight with the "Fat Contribut r." He
had brought along a few s imens
of what he could do-fain efforts
scratched off with chain-ligh ning re
locity. He handed one over. It read:
"MItBDERta !-Aboute to o'clock
last nito the cry' of murder as herd
on one of our mane street and as
usual the police was not in s te. The
cries was repeeted sevral ti es, be

The item was quietly hanled back
to him, and he was informed that De
troit was not his home. Hi talents
were too much for the wn-too
many years iu advance of i They
couldn't appreciate him he e. Out
in Chicago-nearer the setti g sun
they were standing round on the cor
ners looking for such men.
"You hain't foolin', stran er " he
asked, his face expressing th gravest
anxiety.
No, he could depend on i It was
a solemn thing to fool' with a young
man just starting out in ii , and it
was also against office rules.
"And Chicago is-is- ?"
"Just two huntdred and ei hty-four
miles west of Detroit." /
"Good-bye, stranger," he ntinued,
as hie rose up and picked nl his b-n.

under the strap. "I'm very inmuch

A Night's Mishaps.
Lonisvill. Corte pond~c: e ('ilcilunati FBnquirer.
There ca'!,e to IouiSjville W1ednes
daly afterii n, from an interior townl
of Kentnckt, a newly married couple.
who enterei the city and registered
at a promini ,nt hotel with the pleasant
anticiil,.:'' f enjoying a delightful
honlv.ooo, .ainou; :ty folks. Hlay
ing always resided in rural districts,
they knew but little of the customs
of fiashionable people, and with a de
sire to cultivalte such," determined to
catch the manners, living as they lose,
and with this purpose in mind, at
tentively observed people, until they
themselves were the "'observed of all
observers."
Having traveled all day, and being
greatly wearied bytheir'journey, the
country couple retired at an early
hour to their bedroom--No. 72:5.
About midnight both were wrapped
in the aInn of Morpheus. As the
clock struck one, the wife awoke, and
arose and searched the apartment for
drinking water; but, as ill luck would
have it, the chambermaid had neglect
ed to till the pitcher with that most
important fluid. The wife opened
the door, and, glancing along the nlar
row hall, beheld a tin cooler at the
furtherest extremity. Contident that
all guests were shed, she folded her
night robes around her delicate formn
and quietly, yet with cautiousness,
proceeded in the direction of the treas
ured water. It was reached in safety,
but when the faucet was turned no
liquid poured itlelf into the cup. The
fair holder muttered an exclaimuition
of disgust and began to retrace her
Tfootsteps, when she. heard some one
approaching. Like a startled deer
she hastened back, and, glancing at
the door, thought she beheld "255."
and entering the half open door made
haste to thasten it. The inmate, a
man, was resting upon the far side of
the bed, and, with a springsuch as
only country lasses can give, shte was
in bed. 'lhe'man tossed about un
easily but did not awaken. Becom
ing tired of hearing his loud snoring,
she gave him a playful kick, accom
panied with an affectionate arm-cares
sing, all of which he failed to appre
ciate, for leaping up in bed, the man
seized her and iustily yelled "help,"
while she, almost strangled, could
only groan in dismaly.
A great commotion followed to that
part of the hotel, especially in the
next room, and amidst the demand
for admittance, the man continued
crying out that "some one was tryi
ing to muynrler him." Finally the
night watchran opened the door, and
in came a half dozen men and a soli
I tary female, whose uneasy demon
stration..showed she had more than
an ordinary interest at stake. The
gas was turned and a light thrown on
the scene.
Standing in the centre of the bed
over the half dead wife of the coutn
tryman, was a respected elder of the
church. Tableau second was the cono.
tryman and elder's wife demanding
an explanation. The countryman
wanted to have a little pugillistic ex
ercise, but the laughing assemblage
would not permit him to thrash the
elder. Finally it was elicited that in
the hurry of escaping fromn the ap
proaching guest, the verdant wife
had entered room 253 instead of 255,
and the noise she heard was male by
the elder's wife returning from a
gathering down stairs.
The countryman isn't satisfied, nor
is the elder's wife. Both parties .left
that hotel yesterday, and the rural
gentleman vows he has sufficient city
experience to last the remainder of
his life.
TanE AMESDED BANKRUPT LAW.
The following are the principal fea
tures in the amended bankrupt law:
That forty days of default ip the pay
ment of commercial paper are requir
ed instead of fourteen ander the ex
isting law; that one-fourth of the en
tire number of the creditorsi and one
third of the amount of debt, must
join in the petition for involuntary
bantrnptey; that the new law shall
apply to the pending eases in bank
ruptcy instituted since Depember 1,
when the debts secured by the suit
shall have been paid, or wlien a ma
jority of the creditors ask for a dis
continuance; that a volunthry bank
rapt shall.be discharged upon the
payment of 30 per cent. of his indebt
edness; that an involuntary bank
rapt shall be discharged i when lihe
shall have been proved innocent of
any fraud, and that the fees and ex
penses of bankruptcy proceedings
shall be reduced temporarily until the
Supreme Court shall establish a new
system, looking to permanent rednuc
tion and simplification.
"Paddy, my boy," said a gentleman
to an Irialunam, whom he observed
fishing away at a deep pool, "that
must be a favorite stream for trout."
"Faith and sure it must be that same,
for I have been standing here thlis
,three hours, and not one of 'ema will
come out of it."
The Widow's Protest,
B1Y 31ARK TrWAN.
()tr of the saddest things that: ever
carne under my notice (sai(l the I ank
ers clerk) was there ini C'o! li! dii
ring the war. Dan Murphy enli-rtil
as aj,private, and fought very !ra\ve
ly. The bovs all liked him : and
when a wounlrd, by-and-Ily, weakcrnd
hitm down, still carryinrg a musket
was too heavy work for hint, the-y
bclubbed together and fixed him up as
a sutler. lie made money then. and(
sent it always to his wife to ,ank for
him. Sho was a washer and iroer,
and knew enough by hard experimnce
to keep money when ,he got it. she
didn't wasto a penny. On the con
trary, .ho began to get miserly as h,:r
bank account grew. She grieved to
part with as enllt, poor rcamttltre. for
twice in her hard-wolkinm. life she
had known what it was to be hu-ngry,
cold, ftiendless, siek, and oui hut a
dollar in the world, and she hadt a
haunting dread of sutlfciring so aa:in.
Well, at last I)an died, and the boy.,
in testimolny of their esteem and re.s
pect for hint. telegraphed to Mrs. Mur'
phy to know if she would like to have
him emnbahlnml and sent home ; when
I ou know the usual customn was to:
dump a poor devil like him into :a
shiallow hole andti then informn his
fliends what had become of himn. Mrs.
Murphy jumped to the co1nclusionl
.that it would only cost two or three
dollars to embalm her dead hulsband,
and so she telegraphed "Yes." It
was at tile "wake'' that the bill for
embalming arrived and was presented
to time widow.
SIlc uttered a wild, sad wail that,
pierced every heart and said: " ivit
ty-foive dollars for .stootin' )an, blis
ter their sowls! Did thim divils sup
pose I was goin' to start a tInseumn,
that I'd be dalin' in such expensive
curiaLssities ?'
The bankers' clerk said there wais
not a dry eye in the house.
A correspondent of the lBossier Ban
ner, approving of the good intentions
of those who ,are seeking to reftlorm
our State goverunment and apprecia
ting the necesity for speedy reforlm
ation, express the Olpinion, however,
that the better plan is for "the mto
derate lien who have not beeu violent
in their opposition to the Republican
party," to "silently co-operate with
that party in the present juncture."
In the present juncture above all
others, this plan strikes as us a very
imperfect one, to use no stranger ex
pressiolt.
In the first place, the imen who
have not violently opposed the prin
ciples, policy, or tl.e outrageously bad
rule of the Republican party, are not I
the men for an emergency reqruiriný',
as the existing emergency does, firm
ness, independence and fearless ad
vocacy of the people's rights. Prac
tically, we are living in a state of re
volution, when moderate men are lna;
turally incapacitated to lead. Tile
times and the disease demand strong,
heroic treatment. The people have
been assailed with violence-insulted
and outraged; the patient has been
gradully sinking under the treatment
pirescriLed by moderate men who
have not violently thrust the. quacks
and cormorants from his bedside. In
tihe treatment of physical, as well as
moral ailmnents, it is a well-establislh
ed rule that violence must be coun
teracted by violence.
And what has been the result of tle
efforts made hitherto to conciliate the
Republican party ? If we should ad
vise this correspondent to thrust his
hand into the fire, with the assuratnce
that he would be benefitted by the
experimnent, he would regard the
counsel As the emanation of an addle
brain. Have we not, ever since 1868,
by co-operation in corrupt assemblie s.,
by appeals on the hustings, by Fusion,
and by almost every moderate means,
endeavored to bring the affairs of
State, by the aid of Republicans, to
a condition of decency and toleration, f
The venture has proven-what? Simup
ly, that the people have concedled,
without reason, and lost, without
anything but good intentions to con
sole them. Thi is all. And this cor
respondent now recommends the plan
of the fancy clerk who could not
break his calf to work without pla
cing his own Deek under thie yoke as a
moderato co-operator, but finding l
that the calf ran away with him rind
thie yoke, was forced to cry to the by
standers, "Here we come, d-n our
fool souls ! Head us sombody !"--Ona
chita Telegraph.
A few days ago a hungry party sat
idown at the well-spread supper of a
sound steamer, upon which one of the
dishes contained a trout of moderate
size, A serious-looking individual
drew this dish toward, saying, apolo
getically, "This is fast day withl me."
His next neighbor, an Irish gentle
man, immediately inserted his fork
into thie fish and transferred it to his
own plate, remarking, "Sir, do you
suppose nobody has a sowl to be
saved but youiself"
Why are the ladies the biggest
thieves in existence: Because they
steel their petticoats, bone their stays,
cribl, their babies, and hook their
dresses.

A. tablehoonfuil of crlide carbolic
acid to a bucket full of water. Apply

the aniimals.
Another, to be ilsedl in the saenl,
way: lish -oil or coal oil and spirits
amuonia in equal quantities.
By Mr. Stephens, as published( ilt
i the Picayune :--With a sharp instru
lte;lt mlake several inlcýsions in the
affected part; take blistering oiut
ment (flies) which moisten with 'oal
:oil, and make a plaster large cnough
to cover the whole sore. Suffer thi,
to remain until copious suppuration
is piroduced.
Meanwhile drench the animal with
a spoonful of hartshoru in half a bot
tle of whisky.
Should the swelling not diminish,
or there be no appa'rent relief, drench -
ing with the above described mixturet
may Lbe repeated thrice within five
hoilrs, allowing due interval.
Keel the sore well cleaned and up
ply co:lt oil freely.
The Picayune remarks:
"Suppuration is the In line desidera
turn. By that means the poison is
best extracted from the system. To
insulre suppuration it is customary to
use seatons-strings of cotton or hemp
-run through the swelling by means
of a red-hot needle 1-16 or . inch iron
-tiirst sat rating them in cantharadin
or if that be not available, in harts
horn. These seatons should be left
in the flesh with projecting ends, so
that they can be moved slightly at
intervals, thus stimulating suppaura
tion.
This treatment, carefully followed,
has proved esccessf nl tin lost every
instauce--often when theanimal seemi -
ed to be in articmlo mortis. We believe,
from all we can hear, that it is the
best plan tihus far known, and that,
in connection with a stinmulated ap
petite, it will insure tile recovery of
nine animals out of ten which are
stricken with that mnost fatal of all
stock diseases-tho Clharbon.
Another correspondent of the Pica
ynne furnishes thile following renmedy :
'"One spoonful of charcoal mixed
with a pint of whisky, giving one gill
every five minutes-a plaister of char
coal mixed with ½ pint alcohol ap
plied to the effected part."
The Home Journdl of thle 20thl
June, after giving a description of the
disease, specities the treatment as fol
lows:
"As soon as tihe first symptoms of
the disease are discovered, give as a
drench, one piut of whisky, one pint
of strong ginger or red ipepper tea,
and one large table-spoonful eacthl of
spirits of camphor and aqua of anmmo
nia (hartshorn), to be repeated every
fotr hours until the patient is relieved
and the disease subdued. For the
local treatment, tile indications are to
bring on suppuration as speedily as
possible and to prevent the extension
of the inflammation. The first of
these is best filled by a free anld deep
cross-incision through the skin and
subcutaneous tissues, and the imme
diate and frequently repeated appli
cation to the wound, of fly blistering
ointment combined with oil of turpen
tite. in about equal proportions. To
arrest the extension of the swelling
apply over its whole surface and over
two or three inches of the sound skin
sulrouiidiing it, the following mixture,
comnposed of equal parts of tincture
of iodine, tinct. of cantllarides, tinct.
capsicum, kerosene or coal oil and
kreosote--tho application to be made
every tltee 1hours and so thoroughly
as to pcrtectly saturate the hair tldl
