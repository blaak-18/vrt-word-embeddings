In the words of the immortal Lin
coln, “Let reverence for law become
the political religion of the nation.”
The world is today in a chaotic state.
Throughout history as a result of
great wars, there have been upheavals
in society and thus the trend of civ
ilization has been changed from age
to age. The Great War, the greatest
of all wars, the one through which we
have just passed, has wrecked the
foundation of our Christian civiliza
tion until today there is no stability.
The nearest approach to stable gov
ernment and a conservative people is
the government of the United States
of America and its people.
It behooves the Christian men and
women who move after careful
thought and consideration to study
the primary causes of disturbances
in our part of the world today. My
mind goes back to the year 1916,
as I speak, and I remember that this
country re-elected a Preseident and
continued the government because
the President and his government
had kept us out of the great strug
gle then going on between the other
great nations. Almighty God, in the
working out of His great purposes
brought soon after that marvelous
expressions of the people’s will a
mind and a purpose to the American
people to make the world safe for
democracy, which meant to assure to
the people of the world liberty of
thought and action.
The war is long since over. The
opportunity to make the world 3afe
for democracy is still with us, but
is rapidly passing from us. If the
people of the world are to be free
they must come to recognize and to
know that freedom is not license, but
th tf fredom carries with it as its
hand-maiden, responsibility, in a
country where all men are free and
equal. The responsibility of each
thoughtful citizen to his country and
to his brother is a seriou# one. After
a democracy has expressed its will
in the setting up of a constitution, a
government and a code of laws, the
primal responsibility of the God-fear
ing, contract-keeping, honest citizens
is to obey the contract or law which
they set up one with another and
thus to give by combined might of
their individual, whole-hearted sup
port, real strength to righteous gov
ernment.
COLO.
There is abroad in the land today
a growing disregard for law. That
growing disregard for law, if allowed
to continue and to grow is a real
menace to freedom, to liberty, and
to our people. What is law? In
human government, law is the or
ganic rule establishing and defining
conditions in a state or a community.
In the history of the world there
is no record of the enactment or pas
sage of a law which met the approval
of every citizen who was required to
live under and obey the law thus
enacted. The great danger today is
that too many reasonably honest,
reasonably conscientious, reasonably
good citizens are now willing to set
at naught some parts of the consti
tution and certain of the laws enact
ed under the constitution because
they either do not meet or go beyond
their personal beliefs and likes. The
message I am bringing to you today
is that nobody gives you, and each of
you, any right to violate a law or to
wink at its violation because of your
personal disbelief in its rightness or
its operation.
When a law has been legally en
acted, all law-obeying citizens obey
the law. And why has it come to be
the mind of many citizens that the
infraction of certain other laws does
not involve moral turpitude? If we
are to serve our country and to bring
back to our people a reverence for
law as the political religion of our
nation, we must come to see and
know that the violation of any law
involves moral turpitude, and is a
distinct violation of a sacred con
tract with the other citizens of our
country to which contract we are a
distinct party. When contract-break
ing becomes universal, the stability
of any kind of contract on earth be
comes less secure. To my mind, the
greatest need of the American peo
ple is, first, that they come to that
place where they are willing to obey
all law because it is law, and to make
it their business to see that laws that
do not measure up to their highest
standard which duty requires of con
scientious, God-fearing men, be
changed to meet the requirements of
the times.
Our forefathers, when they builded
this government, builded it wisely
and well. For many years, the prin
cipal duty of the citizens of the thir
teen coolonies was to think and talk
to commune and pray, and then to
act in accordance with their recogni
tion of their responsibility to their
country and their God. The Christ’s
civilization, the fairest fruit of man’s
efforts that God’s support up to to
day, depends not upon the enactment
or the repeal of any certain law or
laws bnt upon the patriotic devotion
and thought, the energy and lives of
all the- patriots and Christian men
and Women of our country today.

nity or exemption granted to them

governmental duties that is a quali
fied citizen of America today. The
idea that is abroad in the land that
politics is too low for good people to
take part in it, and that bad people
are politicians and handle the poli
tics of the country, is a damnable
heresy. The best man and woman
who lives in America has no more
right to shun their political and civic
responsibility because it is a dirty,
mean, or unpleasant duty than they
have to refuse to worship God or
obey the decrees of their government,
and if the dirty machine politician is
to continue to be responsible for the
government of our country nation
ally, in states, counties, precincts and
communities, we may expect that the
mighty deeds of a growing nation
wiil soon be greater than the small
vision of selfish, designing men can
compass, rnd that our government
will fail to function and chaos and
ultimate destruction of our Chris
tian civilization will ensue.
So the thing that I am trying to
bring home to you today is that you
had better be about your country’s
business. It is not my job to tell you
what your country’s business is. It
is not the job of anyone else to tell
you what your country’s business is.
It is your job to find out what is the
best thing for your country you can
do, then follow as nearly as possible
in that channel. The lives, pros
perity and liberty of the mass of the
people are dependent upon your ac
tions. Of course, the duties will be
varied in accordance with the chang
ing needs of the people of the country
but when the God-fearing, conscien
tious men and women of America
realize and know their responsibilities
to law and government, and God and
these hand in hand, the problenAs
that seem mighty and overwhelming
today will be. easy of solution and
suitable conditions will return and
not only material prosperity will be
with us, but spiritual prosperity, and
we may expect a generation to fol
low after us working in paths of
pleasantness, whose ways are ways
of peace. „
I am rather disgusted today that
the master minds of politics and many
of the really thinking patriots seem
vastly more interested in the diseases
of war-torn Europe and Asia than
they are in the problems which are
pressing in America today. Let’s
get out and begin to teach and preach
and practice the doctrine of Ameri
canism and let’s make the word
Americanism mean America’s busi
ness, and let’s make it come to be
the primal duty of every citizen to
practice Americanism in a broad way.
The recent war taught us one les
son, and that is that not a few, not
a select class, but that all the peo
ple of this country, at least, are pos
sessed of patriotism, and that the
latent arms of this whole force can
be assembled again whenever the
country calls. Let each man (and
each woman) make it his duty now
and for the next few years to preach
a renaissance of patriotism. Let’s
light anew the fires of consecrated
love of country, and by this fire let’s
warm the hearts of the people of this
nation, and when all are working
side by side in a holy and unselfish
cause, strife and bitterness will pass
away. Unity and peace and broth
erly love will come in and we will be
a one hundred per cent nation work
ing under God toward the accom
plishment of His wondrous purposes.
The quickest w y ay on earth to do
away with a law is not right is to
see that the law is obeyed by the
people of the nation who owe it
obedience. The righteous mind of
the people of the nation will then
bring to pass the certain repeal or
modification of the law to meet the
requirements of the body politic. In
order that I may not be misconstrued
today, I want to go on record here
and now as subscribing to the primal
laws of the United States of Ameri
ca in its entirety. For me > the Con
stitution of the United States of
America is a thing, sacred. While I
firmly believe that the turbulent
mob who wrested from King John at
Runnymead in exchange for his life
and liberty the Magna Charta
brought about the first real step to
real freedom, I just as * firmly be
lieve that it was an instrument of
Almighty God, and as I look back
over the pages of history, makes me
think the work of these brutal, igno
rant men marked a great stepping
stone toward human liberty, and that
neither you nor I would be present
today in the enjoyment of our pres
ent liberty unless these men had
acted then. S& the thing accom
plished there set a stake or mark,
from which mankind has moved on,
the first great fundamental of human
freedom—the right of trial by jury.
I think that the convention which
formulated the Constitution of the
United States after months of
weary, heart-breaking discussion and
seeming failure was another work of
Almighty God, and that today, sanc
tified by the devotion and support
throughout their lives of hundreds
of millions of patriots, it is a divine
work and while the changing condi
tions and the. passing of time require
changes in the constitution, eo long

as it is the primal law of the nation
and the citizens of this great coun
try permit it so to remain, and rev
erence and obey it, that long will
liberty be assnred and freedom the
birthright of our citizens.
It has become the common prac
tice of a large majority of our citi
zens to violate certain laws. This is
undermining all laws, and, if con
tinued, is dangerous. I keep going
back to this point in order that from
every angle you may be confronted
with this fact, that if we are to con
tinue to have a free country, we must
let reverence for law become the
political religion of everybody in this
country—You, I, Bill Jones, and his
wife—and we must quit trying to
place ourselves on an exempted list
because of any influence or ability
which we possess. Christ brought
one addition to the doctrines that
had gone before, that the greatest of
all additions to law or doctrine was
love.
From the beginning of time, the
man of character has been ever
striving to find his duty and do it.
There are so many successful men
who have become arbitrary through
.•success achieved through their power
of concentrated thought and through
their ability to transmute thought
into energy. Be careful, my friends,
each of yqu, that you do not use the
talents which Almighty God has be
stowed upon you, that they will be
a curse instead of a blessing to you.
Remember that perhaps the neigh
bor who cannot reach the high stand
ard of moral and religious intellectu
ality upon which you reside, may be
doing his bit. Do- not get an idea
in your head that God ‘Almighty is
going to require of a human being
something that He cannot do, and do
not let the idea get into your head
that He is going to measure you with
the half-bu«hel basket of a weaker
minded less able personality. The
measure of your acts are the meas
ure of your ability.' The measure of
the acts of the less able men or
women is the measure of their ability.
There are few of us who live up to
our capabilities, that is, our respon
sibilities, and for our derelictions
along this line we are apt to pay
without ceasing on the judgment day.
So I want to convey this thought
to you that as long as you have du
ties, and family duties, you must live
up to your conception of those duties
to the fullest extent. You must per
mit your neighbor to live up to his
conception and by companionship
and instruction, you may fulfill your
duty to the enlightenment of your
fellowmen, but, after all, his right
of action is sacred and guaranteed to
him as it is to you. So attend to
your civic responsibilities under God.
Use every peaceful Christ-like meth
od to get your brother to realize and
to Jfnow what is right and what is
duty, but spread o’er your thoughts
and your actions the broad mantle of
Christian love. Be equal to the last
and greatest doctrine of all, and as
you are willing to give your lives to
God and country, remember to spare
part to your neighbor in helping him
to come and see and know his du-'
ties and to reach the same level upon
which you are permitted to travel in
search of light. As the days and
years of your lives pass, as the
slowly passing sands of your hour
glass pass, let us hope that the con
stant thought, effort, and prayers of
the men and women who are citizens
for our country, will bring into a
secure harbor and that, finally, by
the individual practice of the doctrine
there will come that final day when
reverence for law is the political re
ligion of the nation.
THE CRIME OF
The daily press continues to play
up and emphasize the orgy of crime.
It’s a delectable dish, indeed, they set
before their readers, and it reflects
the sordid minds of the men respons
ible. Something ought to be done
about it. The writer and a number of
others have agreed not to buy a daily
paper that has a big black line across
its front page relating to crime. When
we hear a newsboy yelling the crimes
his paper features that day, we stop
him long enough to tell he we will not
patronize him or his paper. Vicious
as a boycott is, we know of no other
remedy. In a daily paper we find a
lot of interesting news in small type.
We had to hunt between the articles
in a big type featuring crime for
these items: •

AMERICAN HISTORY THAT PROTESTANTS
SHOULD KNOW.
That America was discovered in the
year 1000 by a Norseman, Lief Eric
son, and not by Christopher Columbus,
in 1492, is an historical fact of the
greatest importance and significance.
As an American, you will assuredly
welcome the following information
regarding this issue, and its mean
ing, at the present hour.
Columbus, who never set foot upon
America, was the representative of the
Latin or Mediterranean races, while
Lief Ericson was of the Nordic stock,
from which the Anglo-Saxon race was
developed.
The advocates of Columbus have
been diligent for centuries in clainfc
ing the western hemisphere as a pos
session of the Latin races, particular
ly the Spanish and Italians, both of
whom claim Columbus as their emis
sary, although it has recently been
said by some that he was a Jew, and
by others that he was an Armenian.
In his train followed the religion and
the political order which is centered
in Rome. Spain bent every effort to
make a conquest of the entire west
ern world; and the dire results in
Mexico and South America are a fa
miliar part pf history. But this ef
fort was doomed to failure, and was
at 'length overthrown by the South
American liberator, Bolivar, and
others. Still, the seed and its fruits
are in evidence in Central and South
America.
North America, particularly the
United States, on the other hand, is
purely Anglo-Saxon and Nordic in its
entire development. The western
world, as stated above, was discover
ed by Lief Ericson. Our country was
colonized by the Pilgrims; it was giv
en birth, as a Christian nation, by
Washington, and its unity was pre
served by Lincoln, under the guidance
of God. From the beginning the
menace to America has been the in
fluence of Europe, which Washington
in his divinely bestowed wisdom,
warned against, when he said, “Be
ware of entangling alliances,” and
which Monroe forever barred out when
he established the political principle
known as the Monroe Doctrine.
It is an essential part of the na
ture of the northern people to love
freedom, to fight for liberty, to be de
vout and spiritual in religion, and to
abhor superstitution, serfdom and ig
norance found in Southern Europeans.
Escape European System
To escape the European system of
politico-religion, embodied at the time
in a tyrannical and oppressive ruler,
fifty thousand Norwegian pilgrims
emigrated from Norway, in the tenth
century, to Greenland, Iceland and
Scotland. The Norse Bad invented
the keel which enabled them to sail
over heavy and to go on long
voyages. They were famous as na
vigators. The sagas and records of
that time as well as the researches
of later investigators, prove beyond
doubt that one of these pilgrims,
Bjami Herjulfeon, made a voyage
across the Atlantic, and came within
sight of land to the west, without
going ashore. The tale of this ex
ploit which he related on his return
to Greenland was heard by the son
of Eric the Red, Leif Ericson, who
had been commissioned by King Olaf
Trygvasson of Norway to search out
this western land, which Lief accept
ed as a divine command. The oppor
tunity came for him to bqy Bjarni
Herjulfson’s ship, in which Lief set

of Vikings and, landed, touching three
peninsulas, Newfoundland Nova Scot
ia, and Cape Cod, building his house
and passing the winter near the latter
on the mainland, which he called Vine
land, because of the grapes he found
there, “not planted by the hand of
man.” He made known his discovery
and described the character of the
new land upon his return to Green
land the following year.
Thereupon an expedition was un
dertaken by Thorfinn Karlsefni, who
traced Leif’s course and landed at the
same spot in what is now New Eng
land. The explorations and settle
ments of the Norse continued up to
1347, when the outbreak of the Black
Plague so decimated the population
of the homeland that further voyages
were not made.
Protestantism, as we now know it,
had not at that early time been recog
nized, and yet the records indicate
that the Norse, in their very nature,
were resistant to thq religo-political
system headquartered in Rome. An
incident recorded in the Saga of Eric
the Red (and other sagas, in almost
identical language) related that Leif
rescued some shipwrecked voyagers
from the waves, among whom was a
Roman priest. When he told his
father, Eric, about this rescue, he
was rebuked by the remark that he
had spoiled his good deed in rescuing
the others by his evil deed in rescu
ing the priest. The claim advanced
today in parochial schood histories and
elsewhere that Leif Ericson was a
communicant of the Roman system is
without foundation.
These historical facts, gleaned from
the Icelandic Sagas and which are at
tested by records whose truth can
not be impugned, and which are ac
cepted by scholars, establish that the
discoverer of America was Leif Eric
son. He was the one who set out
in the year 1000 and found the new
Western World, and who returned and
made its existence known. Since
there. were no printing presses nor
means of ready communication be
tween the nations and races of Eu
rope, knowledge did not spread with
the same rapidity as today; but never
theless a scholar, Adam of Bremen,
in the year 1073, wrote a volume, pre
served in Copenhagen, Denmark, in
which he described the Norse discov
ery of the Western World; and this
knowledge of land to the west was in
the possession of the learned men of
Europe from that time.
Vatican Hides Facts
The hour had not yet come when
colonization of the new land was to
be begun. Discovery and colonization
are separate and distinct steps in the
developmen of this nation. It is a
matter of record that in 1477 Colum
bus made a voyage to Iceland and in
terviewed the seafaring men there
who inherited their knowledge of the
Western world from their forefathers.
It is also beyond question that in the
archives of the Vatican, where in
formation and learning of every sort
was carefully filed, there were re
cords of the Norse discovery of Vine
land, of the voyages of the Vikings
to our shores. This prior knowledge
which Columbus had at his disposal
gave him that extraordinary confi
dence which the romantic accounts of
his voyage to San Salvador ascribed
to his “enlightenment from Heaven.”
A quotation on this point, from a
volume entitled “America Not Discov
ered by Columbus,” written by Prof.
Rasmus B. Anderson of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, and published in
1901, is of interest:
“The antiquities of the North furn
ish a series of incontestible evidence
that the coast of North America was
discovered in the latter part of the
tenth cenury, immediaely after the
discovery of Greenland by the Norse
men. * * * The fault that we find
with Columbus is that he was not
honest and frank enough to tell where
and how he obtained his previous in
formation about the lands he pre
tended to discover; that he some
times talked of himself as chosen by
Heaven to make this discovery, and
that he made the fruits of his labours
subservient to the dominion of in
quisition.”
Columbus was in no eense the dis
coverer of America. His voyage had
been ante-dated by nearly 500 years
by a prior navigator, Leif Ericson.
Columbus never set foot on North
America, having been strangely di
verted from his course toward it by
the southward flight of a flock of
birds, which led him to turn the prows
of three ships toward San Salva
dor. Before he made his second
voyage and landed on the mainland in
South America, John Cabot, an agent
of the King of England, had landed
on the mainland of North America at
the same Ideality where its dis
coverer, Lief Ericson, had set his
standard in the year 1000. As if
following a divine plan, the coloniza
tion of North America likewise began
with representatives of the Anglo-
Saxon, or Nordic race—the Pilgrims,
under William Bradford—who landed
on Plymouth Rock in 1620, again
guided to the same divinely appoint
ed spot which was prepared by Eric
son and Cabot*
ANGLO-SAXON DEVELOPMENT
North America in its beginning, in
its development, and fruition, i» An
glo-Saxon. The French and Spanish,
who attempted to claim part of it in
later years, such as Florida, Louisi
ana and California,, were driven out
or forced to sell their holdings. The
attempted penetration of the United
States by Latin Europeans, from Co
lumbus’ time to this, has menaced our
nation, until today at last there is
an awakening to the danger which
threatened, and immigration is dras
tically limited.
The agents of the Roman system,
who take Columbus as their cham
pion, are notably aggressive, adroit,
and active in political circles. They
have pushed the Columbus claim as
persistently as possible, and have
cast about him a mantle of romance
unjustified by the facts—for Colum
bus was anything but an honorable
and upright character. A picture
representing his alleged discovery of
America has been placed upon our
currency; our municipal politicians
have given his name to streets,
parks, and plazas;, cities and rivers
have been named for an adventurer
who had rothing to do with our na
tion, never set foot here, was not its
discoverer, and represents a culture
and civilization fundamentally op
posed and hostile to our own, which
stands for complete separation of
church and state, a free press, free
speech, and free public schools.
In the Committees on the Judiciary
of the Senate and the House, there is
now pending a measure to declare
October 12th a legal holiday, to be
known as Columbus Day. Congress
man Michael J. Hogan of New York,
who introduced the measure in the
House, is a Roman Catholic, “edu
cated” in parochial schools. Senator
William M. Cailder of New York, the
Senate sponsor for an identically
worded measure, who is ostensibly a
Protestant, was given an honorary
degree recently by one of the large
New York Catholic colleges, Arch
bishop Hayes presiding. Regarding
Senator Calder’s act in introducing
the Codumbus Day bill, the following
statement by Jay W. Forest, Master
of the Sons and Daughters of Wash
ington, printed in the New York Sun,
is of interest:
“The only people in the United
States who want a Columbus holiday
are the Irish Roman Catholic Knights
of Columbus. When we as a nation
start making national holidays, we
have plenty of Americans to honor
first. The day of the man who bar
gains for the votes of the Irish in this
country is over.”
The “Knights” who take Columbus
as their patron, have been conducting
an agressive campaign to spread the
Roman-politico-religion over the Unit
ed States, “revise” our history, and
attack our school system by opposing
all legislative measures designed to
strengthen it, notably the Towner-
Sterling education bill. In the inter
est of this anti-Anglo-Saxon system,
Columbus is a leading medium of pro
paganda, the false argument being
that since he “discovered” America,
it rightfully belongs to his co-religion
ists. All this is being met and over
come at the present hour, because the
rise of truth has overtaken the lie,
and is putting it down. Every true
American will take a lively interest
in uncovering the falsity of the Co
lumbus claim, and in helping to es
tablish the truth concerning the dis
covery of America by Lief Ericson in
the year 1000.
Write letters to your local papers;
enlighten your public officials, school
teachers and members of school
boards; petition Washington to take
the picture of Columbus from our pa
per currency and from our national
public buildings. The sword of Truth
is unsheathed! Wield it for the hon
or and redemption of our country.

OUR PREACHER
Who is it climbs from floor to floor!
Whose form is welcome at the door!
Who shares his friendship to the
core ?
Who is it gives without reserve
Of time, and strength, and harried
nerve,
And thinks not from the task to
•werve ?
OUR PREACHER.
Who is it calls each child by name T
Who is it glides into their game
And makes their joy his choicest
aim?
Who is it, though his hair be snow,
Retains a spirit quite aglow
With youth, and always will be so?
OUR PREACHER.
Who is it, through the snow and rain.
Hastes always to the bed of pain,
And never thinks such service vain?
When shadows fall and folks are blue,
And plans and hopes all go askew.
Whose optimism makes things new?
OUR PREACHERS
Who is it in the hour of grief,
When death comes stalking like a
thief,
Is always near to bring relief?
Whate’er the circumstance or need.
Who is it always puts the deed
Into the center of his creed?
OUR PREACHER.
