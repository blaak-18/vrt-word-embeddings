ZN' PAREIRS PRINTLIVNG
Por the year begining July z,
$894, The Gazette and The Adver
User will be the official journals of
the parish of Lafayette. At the
meetlug of the Police Jury Thurs
day the managers of both papers
presented a joint bid offering to do
Ike parish printing one year for
Â· 7t, the price formerly paid to
Str. Bailey when The Advertiser
eas the official journal of the parish.
The bid was accepted by the Police
Jiry and in the future all official
maatter will appear in both papers..

No matter what his motive may
have been, it was a graceful act in
Senator Hill to move that President
Cleveland's salary be exempted
from the operations of the income
tax. Nevertheless the exemption
is unwise. If the salaries of con
gressmen and other federal officials
are taxed, that of the President
should be taxed also. It will be
graceful in the President to decline
the exemption. He can easily have
it stricken out in the House.--The

The Washington press correspon
dents are puzzling over the problem
of the intent of Senator C=all of
Florida in removing his shoes
dutring the heat of debate, and ele
vating his stocking feet before the
astonished Senate. Some of the
simple-minded see in this manifes
tation only a somewhat fetid relax
ation, but there is a rising suspic
won that it was intended by the
senator as a body blow to plutocracy
and an assertion of the rights and
privileges of untrammelled democ
racy. This is said to be in line with
the challenge given in the House by
a Massachusetts representative in
the removal of his coat in a former
Congress, and it is hailed as a
mark of progress that Senator Call
was permitted to elevate his feet
without any collision.
DR. KNAPP CHARGED IVITHI
EMBEZZLEMENT.
Last week Sheriff Rees of St.
Martin visited Lake Charles with a
warrant for the arrest of Prof. S. A.
Knapp, who is charged with embez
zlement. The complaint alleges
that John Domec, Darmas D.
Guidry anrd H. L. Durio have been
defrauded of a quantity of sugar
cane. Prof. Knapp being in Ten
nessee was telegraphed for anrd has
returned home.
Whether Prof. Knapp is guilty
or not it is for the court to say.
If he is innocent, a thorough inves
tigation of his alleged dishonest
transactions will prove his inno
cence. Before the holding of the
last term of our criminal court 'Ihe
Gazette expressed the hope that the
proper authorities would take the
matter up and sift it.
The many victims in this parish
of what Mr. Knapp terms the "tem
porary embarrassment of the Teche
'Rtilroad and Sugar Company"
-will watch with keen interest the re
-suilt of the occusation. If he is not
proved guilty, they will be glad to
see'him honorably acquitted, but
on e other hand, if he is proved

oar correspoadent Is in error. The I
ease is as follows: A. H. Gilbeau, a man
with whom neither I nor our company, to
my akn*ledge, have ever had any business I
relations and whom I do not know, (but (
who is represented as irresponsible finan
cially), made a charge of enbezzlement in t
three specific cases where cane was pur- I
chased by the Teche Railrcad and Sugar
Company. No amount is named.
The affidavit was made before a justice of
the peace and the warrant issued by him.
It is at least peculiar that a man who knew
nothing of the facts and was in no way in
terested, should make oath before a magis
trate who has no jurisdiction.
In the three specific cases namedjn the
affidavit we hold complete vouchers, pro
perly signed and witnessed, covering in ]
detall every point in the accusation and re
futing the same. The charge is without
foundation and without excuse in the minds
of all just nten.
The future must determine the sinister
motive which instigated it. The temporary
embarrassment of the Teche Railroad and
Sugar Company was due solely to a failure
to secure funds, pledged by responsible
parties, upon the faith of which a railroad
was built. Simply this and no more. I
have the honor to remain yoqrs truly,

The Sunday Law in the Parish
of Lafayette.
CARENCRO, LA., June 28. 1894,
Dear Little Miss IHatchet.
The second next big bull of the
parish of Lafayette, the 6th ward,
says that you did not consult the
people and citizens of this ever
wishing free section about the ob
noxious and infernal Sunday-Law,
but ventured a protest against its
repeal after having consulted only a
few scattered neighbors of yours.
Said big bull has almost four hundred
voters and out of this respectable
number about a dozen would vote
for the Sunday law; yet, they as well
as those of your section would
crack a toddy on Sunday, as well as
any other day of the week and wade
smoothly the threshold of the bar
room.
We want a civil government and
civil laws, but none of that having
the shadow of some book written in
the long past and not exactly known
by whom. The first settlers of this
great country have left their homes,
on the other side of the Atlantic to
get away from church thralldom;
those of 1776 fought for liberty and
in framing the Constitution by
which we are governed to day, have
separated state and church-no con
cordat-Why then, as a daughter of
the soldiers of z776, do you approve
of a law that is religious? The
Sunday law teaches men and boys
to violate the laws of the State,
makes them hypocrites and pharises.
Necessites egentum mendacem
fecit
It is well known that all European
countries have associated their civil
government to church authority for
centuries past and that despite
clerical influence, never such a law
as the Sunday law, became a notarial
law. I say European countries,
meaning that Protestants as well as
Catholic or Greeks have state and
church associated. They are
tolerant enough to admit liberty of
conscience and of creed which
some of our ,sectarians here refuse
to recognize. The Roman and
Greek church, mother of all modern
divisions of religion are not opposed
to the Sunday business. Then the
ologians do not consider this Biblical
command, of resting one day,
supreme. Be generous; observe
your Sunday as you judge best and
grant us the same privilege. How
would you like to be compelled, by
law, to go to church with a sun bon
net, drink tepid water, not allowedl
to converse more than five minutes
a "seance" with your beau or have
picnics prohibited ?
Mala est medicina ubi aliquid
naturae perit.
Hon. Julian Mouton was right
when he presented the bill for the
repeal of the obnoxious and Infernal
Sunday law. Mr. Moutton is plucky
and is a genius and should be kept,
as our representative, for twenty
years. I do not mean to say that
he is faultless, but he is just the
man we want and in the right place.
Now, dear little Miss Hatchet,
I'll bet that if the Legislature were
to permit the good people of the
parish of I.afayette, to vote for or
against the Sunday law, that twenty
to-one would go against.
As a lady you might wish to have
the last word, if so, speak and I'll
sleep. ZAnO.

e Personal Appearance of Christ.
f A correspondent of the London
1 Chronicle writes:
SSunday last Rev. Dr. Newman delivered a
1 discourse upon the humlnity of Jesus Christ,
in which he stated that nothing had been
handed down to us in regard to His personal
Saplpearance, many different views being en
tertained on that subject. Inclosed you
- will find a letter written by Publius Lentu
1 lus, President of Judea, and sent by him
to the Senate of Rome, when the fame of
Jesus began to be spread abroad in the
world. These are his words:
'"There lives at this tilmle in Judea a man
1 of singular virtue, whose name is Jesus
Christ, whom the harbarians esteem a
prophet, but IHis own followers adore IIim
I as the offspring of of the immortal God.
Ile calles back the dejd from their graves,
and heals all sorts of dliseases with a word
Sor touch. lie is tall and well shaped, of
an amicabl, revered aspect. His hair of
a color that can hardly be matched, falling
e in graceful curls below Ils ears, and very
agreeably ills shoulders, parted on the
crown of the head.
"lls forehead is smooth, and large; Iis
cheeks without other spot, save that of a
lovely red; His nose andi mouth formed
t with exquisite symmetry; His beard thick,
and of a color suitable to the hair of His
Shead, reaching an inch Ibelow His chin and
1 parting in the middle like a fork; His eyes
bright, clear, and serene He rebukes with
Smajesty, counsels with mildness; His whole
address, wheth:r in word or deed, being
Selegant and grave. No man has seen Him
laugh, but he has wept frequently. He is
t very temperate, modest and wise; a man,
for Ils excellent beauty and divine perfec
Stion, surpassing the children of mnen.'
The Discovery Saved His Life.
Si Mr. G. Caillonette, Druggist, Beavers
yville, Ill., says: "To Dr. King's New
e Discovery I owe my life. Was taken
r with la Grippe and tried all the physicans
y for miles albout, but of no avail and was
given up and told I could not live. Having

The Weekly Courier-Journal has
announced another of its popular
guessing contests, taking the tem
perature at Louisville during tl.e
month of August as the basis. One
thousand dollars in cash will be
given free as presents to the new or
old renewing subscribers who guess
the hottest day, at Louisville, during
August, and give the closet guess to
the highest temprature the Weather,
Bureau thermometer will reach on
that day.' The subscription price 1
of the Weekly Courier-Journal is S
a year. Each guess must be accom
panied by one yearly subscription.
No newspaper published in the
United States has been so liberal to
its subscribers, or has offered such
liberal prizes to secure new subscrib
ers, as the Courier-Journal. During
the past eighteen months it has given
away in presents, absolutely free,
$17,400 in money, not to mention
such premieum articles as sewing
machines, watches, guns, etc. This
in spite of the business depression,
that is felt as much or more in news
paper offices than in any other busi
ness. The Weekly Courier-Journal
has just announce the lucky guessers
in its May rainfall contest. There
were 222 of these guessers, distri
buted over the States of Alabama,
