1 he Warm, the Cold and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted 1903 by W. T. Foster.)
St. Jpseph, Mo., Feb. 21.-Last bulle
tin gave forecasts of disturbance to
cross the continent February 23 to 27,
warm wave 22 to 26, cool wave 25 to 28.
Next disturbance will reach the Pa
cific coast about February 28, cross
west of Rockies by close of March i,
great central 'valleys 2to 5, eastern
state 6.
bhis will be a cold storm accompanied
by snows in northern latitudes and the
weather will be stormy on nearly all
the continent.
The storm center will probably move
eastward south of parallel 40 after
having crossed the Missouri valley
from the Pacific slope.
Warns wave will cross west of the
Rockies about February 2$, great cen
tral valleys March 2, eastern states 3.
Cool wave will cross west of Rockies
about March 3, great central valleys 5,
eastern states 7.
This warm wave will not bring high
temperatures and will not remain
long. The cool wave will go to low tem
peratures and make it appear that win
ter will linger in the lap of spring.
About date of this bulletin tempera
tures will be moderate, a cool wave
coming, cloudy weather and the warm
est part of the month will have passed.
Temperature of the week ending
March 2 will average and rainfall will
be above normal.
Minneapolis (Minn.) Progress of
February 7 said: "The Progress begins
today the publication of weather fore
casts by Prof. W. T. Foster, who is
more accurate in prognosticating the
weather two weeks or more in advance
than is the government weather bureau
one day in advance. Watch his bulle
tins."
Next bulletin will give general fore
casts of March weather.
Don't forget that weather events
move from west to east. and that where
not otherwise designat&d all my fore
casts give the date near which these
events will reach meridian 9t+, about the
line of the Mississippi river. These
weather changes, move eastward at an
average of about 6oo miles a day.
AllTRATION COMMITTEE.
An Official Statement by Secretary
Cannon.
At the end of the meeting held Friday
night the following statement was
handed in for publication:
The arbitration committee appointed
by the labor mass meeting of the 5gth
instant met at 7:30 psm. at labor flall.
After the meeting was called to order
by Chairman Bernstein a roll of the
committee was called and the following
responded to their names: M. Bern
stein, Carpenters Union; James, Can

Railway Firemens Union; Dr. Randell
Hunt, citizens. Credentials of M. A.
Wood of the Blacksmiths Union was

the Barbers Union then reported him
self' present.
Dr. Hunt suggested that as the com
mittee was large hnd therefore un
wiely, a committee of five be selected
to be the voice of the whole committee.
This suggestion was discussed at some
length by Messrs. Orr, Gannon and
Whitlatch, the latter endorsing what
Dr. Hunt had said as to the adbisabil
ity of inviting a member of the Law
and Order League to accept a place on
the arbitration committee. This idea
met with some opposition by some of
the committee. On motion, Mr. Louis
Malkus, who was not a member of the
co ao tee, was allowed the privilege of
the floor, and he advised that the busi
ness of the committee be confined to
those regularly appointed.
On motion a sub-committee of five
was appointed by a chair to carry out
the instructions of the general commit
fee- The dhties of this sub-committee
were declared to be to take the prelim
inary steps to bring abopt arbitration.

CRAWFORD'S CASE.
A new trial has been granted in the
case of Dr. G. B. Crawford. convicted of
manslaughter. The pleas for a new trial
were sustained. Some of the jurors had
read law looks which had been left care
lessly in their reach in the court room.
utnder the law this was fatal. The bond
was fixed at $2.500, on giving which Dr.
Crawford will be released from jail. The
next trial of Dr. Crawford will be fixed
later.
The dutles Was tn Doubt.
The recent St. Andrew's dinners, ac
cording to the Westminster Gazette,
have been noteworthy for the profu
sion of Scotch stories, which in several
cases fairly set the tables in a roar.
Some of them have an ancient ring,
but there Is one that is perhaps not
generally known. A doctor was at
tending a dangerous case where a
Scotch butler was engaged. On calling
in the forenoon he said to Donald. "I
hope your master's temperature is
much lower today than It was last
night" "I'm no' see very sure aboot
that." replied the butler. "for he dee'd
this morning."
An Autherlty.
Peter McArthur was once talking
with a friend when be quoted another
man as a financial authority. lis
friend disputed the right of the person
quoted to be considered an expert. Mr.
McArthur Insisted that the man had a
right to speak like an oracle.
"What Is your definition of an au
thority?" asked his friend.
"My Idea of an authority." retorted
Mr. McArthur. 'is a person who bluffs
beyond my limit."
SttraIee Relattoas.
It took place in a dairy.
The dairyman was pouring large!
quantities of milk through a fine wire

A SINGULAR case of attempted
robbery occurred not long since.
Two young women were riding
in a cab near the dock of one of
the great transatlantic steamer lines in
New York. Wagons, street cars. pedes
trians and carriages were mixed up in
inextricable confusion. The two young
women were richly and showily dress
ed. One of them, ungloved. displayed
the fingers of each hand loaded to the
knuckles with gorgeous rings. They
were so numerous and they glittered
so they gve the impression that the
wearer had horrowed them from a Jew
elry shop in order to show them and
herself off to the miscellaneous crowd
at the steamer dock. The carriage con
taining the women was stopped by a
blockade of vehicles. The beringed
one rested her hands most complacent
ly and admiringly in a position where
they would be visible to all the world.
Suddenly a boy of fifteen sprang at
her with a large, open knife. He grab
bed one of the hands and slashed the
fingers across, cutting a tremendous
gash. It is a horror to write and think
of, but the young fiend was trying to
cut her fingers off so he could get her
rings. He was prevented before he
finished the deed, but he came very
near it. For the moment the sight of
those gems, richer than anything he
had ever seen, so close to him madden
ed him. A dreadful wretch? Oh. yes,
of course. But what of the girt who
made the tempting display merely to
gratify her own vulgar vanity? For
it is the extreme of vulgarity and Im
perfect breeding to display a load of
valuable jewels outdoors in a miscel
laneous herd of mortals, aside from the
danger of it.. To wear outdoors in a
public crowd any garment or ornament
that glaringly arrests attention is in
the worst possible taste, and it is some
thing no high bred woman ever does.
A certain woman Is traipsing up and
down the lanE lecturing on "Home Is
Woman's Place." Then why does not
this woman stay there?
A disgruntled thinker says that man
Is a bundle of prejudices and woman
a bundle of superstitions.
There? Is no shufling or dodging in
the attitude of President dames of the
Northwestern university atEvanston in
the matter of coeducation. He comes
out calmly and candidly in favor of it
and says the American policy is to give
woman as full opportuntty as man for
higher education. Then he calls atten
tion to the necessity for two entirely
separate and equally equipped sets of
college buildings, where the sex line is
drawn among students. He says it will
be'a4ong time ere the American people
can afford to erect two such sets of
buildings for every scholastic institu
tion;-.then he adds. "Nor will such a
duplication of edncational facilities
ever be justifed by the fancied evils of
coeducation." Let us not forget that
President Edmund J. James. Ph. D..

Is in favor of justice to women and
says so

Here is precisely what might be ex
pected In a city like New York. whose
mayor and superintendent of education
distinctly discriminate against women:
An ordef waa. issued that high school

be subjected to a physidal examination.
that it might, be ascertained whether
they were h.4lthy enough to under
take the profession they proposed for
themselves. And the physicians that
were to examine them were to be men.
Now, how does this strike the really
enlightened portion of the American
people, who are mostly outside of New
York city?
An interesting discussion has been
started on the question. "Shall wives
forgive deserting husbands?" Here is
the correct answer: "Let each deserted
wife And out for certain whether here
husband would forgive her and take
her bask in case she deserted him for
awhile. Then. if she is dead sure he
would, and if she still is fond enough of
him to try him again, let her forgive
him."
A tightly laced woman cannot stoop
over to put on her own overshoes?
Well, neither can a fat man. I have
watehed nue try it.

Ruble.
Many women have a sort of warmed
over tone in their voices when they
endeavor to be polite and cordial to
their friends and acquaintances.
The last national convention of the
western labor unions and Western
Federation of :Miners at Denver passed
a resolution indorsing woman suffrage
and recommending Its adoption in all
the states. Now let us see what the
et stern labor unions will do.

A VAMO^fNOABLE LECTURE.
MDem't Harvr or Wrcy-" aat How
the Subledt Was Heeded.
Eleven o'clock was the hour set for
Mime. Soulful's lecture before the Hy
patian association. At 11 o'clock no
body was in the room. Only the usher.
Mrs. Osprey. hovered near the door to
see that no one got into the yellow
dream room without a ticket. Ten min
utes past 11 a sprinkling of elegantly
clad ladies moved through the lobby
looking a little embarrassed becaus;
they were so early. Quarter past 11
three old ladles in black took seats n'
in the front of the hall, so they cou.I
hear. Twenty minutes past 11 othc
seats began to fill, acquaintances no
ded to one another across the hall ais
the real entertainment began, as wa
manifest from the buzz of gentle con
versation. Half past 11 the hall was
*1
"DON'T HBBRY OR WORBT."
half filled. Twenty minutes to 12 the
ladies began to drop in frequently.
Quarter to 12 the chairs were nearly
filled and there proceeded the feminine
interchange of seats and minds and
getting settled. The lone woman who
had orders to be ready at 12 with her
report of the lecture for the afternoon
paper was on needles, but no one else
was.
w-.
Ten minutes to 12 Mrs. Ermine and
Mrs. Milyn gravely mounted the plat
form.
"Oh, there's Mrs. Milyun! What's she
going on the grand stand for?" whis
pered a lively lady to her neighbor.
Mrs. Ermine stood up and said, "We
will first hear from Miss Romboli. who
will whistle for ug a little tune or
two."
Then Mrs. Ermine slipped down from
the "grand stand." leaving only Miss
Romboli. Mrs. Milyun and the lecturer
to occupy it Miss Romboli whistled
very prettily When she finished, the
ladies looked at one another, said
"O-h-h!" "A-h-h'" and clapped their
hands softly for her to do it some more.
Which she kindly did.
By that time it was 12 o'clock. The
newspaper woman left even before
Miss Romboli began to warble and
faked up a report for her paper. She
had to do so or lose her assignment,
and she was a space writer. Ten min
utes after the lecture, according to
schedule time. should have ended Mrs.
Milyun, a leathery looking little old
lady in black. rose briskly, cleared her
throat and said:
"Ladies, f have been requested >
Mrs. Ermine to introduce the lectitret.
I know the ladies are very busy and
the audience is restless, but at the close
of the lecture Miss Romboli will give
us another little whistle or two. and I
hope the ladies will kindly stay till nal
is finished. I now have the pleasure of
introducing to you Mrs. Bowlful, who
will speak to us on-hm-m-er-the sub
ject announced on the programme.
Ladies, Mrs. Bowlful, who comes to us
highly commended."
Now, Mme. Soulful was a lady much
better and more favorably known in
the land than Mrs. Milyun, but Mrs.
Milyun spoke the words "very highly
commended" exactly as if she had
been describing an animal at a county
fair. If Mme. Soulful had her own
thoughts. she would not let her coun
tenance express them. thereby giving
her audience sis object lesson in that
self control on which she lectured.
"Mind Building" was her theme. She
told them how they could begin at any
time and build new and improved
brain cello. "Above all." said Mme.
Soulful. "don't hurry and don't worry.
Calmly concentrate down within your
selves and build new and orderly
thought habits. You express outward
ly exactly the result of your thought
habits in the past. You look like your
thoughts."
Here leathery little old Mrs. Milyun
looked as though she didn't need any
making over as to appearance, however
the est might t" hit, also as though
she nzieded nothing more in the way of
orderly and exact thought habits.
lime. Soulful spoke perhaps three
q arters of an hour. But long ere she
come to her closing advice. "Don't
worry itnd don't hurry." the ladies in
I the audience began to act as if they
had the running of the planet in
their minds and it would wabble in
its orbit and spill if they did not g't
out of the hall. The promptness they
left off at the first end of the lec
ture they put at the last end. Before
and while Miss Romboli whistled they
rustled out by twos and threes and
fours, murmuring:
"Oh. wasn't it lovely ?"
