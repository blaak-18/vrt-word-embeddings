Say of Other Editors
KNOX SHOULD RESIGN.
Secretary Knox’s big stick diplo
macy, or, as Rev. MacArthur would
say, our Golden Rule policy in diplo
macy, in Central America has proven
as great a failure as his Chinese poli
cy in Asia. In Nicaragua he started
out to depose one President and elect
an agent of J. P. Morgan & Co. in his
place. By the aid of American men
and arms, and the prestige of our
Government, he succeeded in the
first, but has signally failed in the
latter, and our navy and troops are
withdrawn.
There will be an intensely bitter
feeling against the United States not
only in Nicaraugua, but in all the
Central and South American repub
lics as a result of this gross blunder
on the part of Secretary Knox.
A step toward repairing that blun
der would be the resignation of Sec
retary Knox, and the sooner the bet
ter. —Watertown (S. Dak.) Times.
TALK DOESN’T ALWAYS GET
THINGS.
Some voters think because Bryan
is a skillful orator and talks enter
tainingly he ought to be President.
Talk is cheap, and sometimes beau
tiful, but it must produce something
to amount to anything. Did you
ever stop to consider that the violet
never produces anything? It is
beautiful, sweet-scented, but it pro
duces only colorless flowers. Bryan’s
theories are colorless and seedless.
You might plant a harvest of them
and you wouldn’t get enough results
to save a starving tomtit.—The Yel
low Jacket.
THE VAMPIRE.
Today a vampire food trust is
sucking the life blood of the Ameri
can people, 'with extortion prices for
the necessities of life, none of which
it produces; it simply corners the
products produced by others.
While digesting its diet of blood,
it finds time to hire editorial and
pedagogical sycophants who try to
earn their salaries by falsely assert
ing through reams and reams of (to
the press) gratitous “Dope” that the
“producers of food and meat prod
ucts and others are to blame for the
present famine prices.”
•Like its brother, the vampire bat
of India, that also lives on blood, it
seeks to lull the people to sleep, to
close their eyes to its high crimes
and misdemeanors against humanity.
Its brother, the vampire bat of In
dia, finds its victim, perchance, lying
drowsy in the shade, it approaches
as he closes his eyes to forgetful
ness, closer yet ever closer, lulling
him to still deeper slumber, by the
soft purring, gentle vibrations of its
fanning wings. Soon in deepest
slumber he sees not, hears not, feels
not, the prodding beak of the vam
pire, draining his heart's blood; after
which it leaves him prone, pale,
stark, never more to rise.
When the American people learn
that “Monopoly,” which the people
voted upon themselves, is responsi
ble for famine prices, for life’s neces
sities, they will know how to treat
the vampire food trust, and its “fan
ning wings,” the pedagogical and
editorial “Dope” distributors, and
sleep producers.—Kansas Common
er, Wichita, Kan.
Rockefeller says he has always
been the servant of the people. He
seems to have “knocked down”
quite a bit of his employer’s money.
—Coffee Co. News, Douglas, Ga.
It is said that Champ Clark has
announced an increase of 100 per
cent, in lecture rates on the Chatau
qua circuit, in view of his bright
prospects of being Speaker of the
next House. Thus the poor “ulti
mate consumer” gets it in the neck
no matter who wins.—Crawford Co.
News, Roberta, Ga.
That man McKinley insulted Kan
sas people when he said “I am here
to explain the administration’s posi
tion on the tariff.” Kansas people
know the administration’s position.
Hence, so many insurgents.—Better
Way, Minneapolis, Kansas.
It is reported that the United
States Government will soon issue a
cook book entitled “Economic Use
of Meats in the Home.” Some of us
will have to find the meat before the
book will be of any use to us.—La
Grange (Ga.) Reporter.
Aside from voting themselves an
increase of $2,500 a year in salary,
our Congressmen vote themselves
other nice plums; such as the privi
lege to mail campaign literature to
constituents at the expense of the
constituents aforesaid. Nice, of
course, to be thus remembered by
your Congressmen; and the litera
ture sent you is SO lucid, SO enter
taining!—St. Augustine (Fla.) Me
teor.
The indications now are that in
terest in the Congressional election
in this district, with Howard and
Tribble opposing candidates, will in
crease as time advances. If Mr.
Howard does not successfully show
up against the charges made by Mr.
Tribble and others who seem up and
thoroughly posted upon the records,
he will not have such a walk-over as
some of his closest friends think.—
Eatonton (Ga.) New r s.
President Barrett, of the Farmers’
Union, is at Washington in the in
terest of the agricultural classes. He
has submitted a series of six ques
tions to the members of the Senate
and House, and the distinguished
gentlemen in these bodies fell all
over themselves in lining up in ac
cordance with the wishes of the Un
ion on the subjects of postal banks,
parcels post, reduced tariff on living
necessities, elimination of specula
tion with farm products, restricted
immigration, and larger appropria
tions in the interests of the farmer.
Suppose Bro. Barrett is trying to
make the Union a factor in national
politics? Suppose that'Union labor
does the same thing? They have a
clear right to do so, just as much
right as the banker, the manufac
turer and the railroads, who have al
ways been active in such business.
No doubt things will improve in
Washington when all interests exer
cise a proper voice in government.—
Pell City (Ala.) Progress.
A HINT TO THE HEARTLESS.
“The lamp-post and the common
people.”—Senator Cummings.
The poor may starve, you do not
mind,
It troubles not your pampered
sleep,
Yet you may wake some day to find
That rope is cheap.
Your money moves the lawyer’s jaw,
It buys the scoundrels of our land;
But though you overthrow the law,
Our lamp-posts stand.
You men whom lust of power con
trols,
You men who rise on human
wrecks;
You have no hearts, you have no
souls,
But you have necks.
—J. J. DOOLING.

The Sunny South Brotherhood
(concluded from page five)
A GOOD LETTER.
Dear Daddy Jim: —I will enter
your Post-Card Club, and also give
my ideas of the Sunny South Broth
erhood. It would be a grand club in
any community. It would help to
support the crippled, sick and needy,
and cheer them when they are sad,
if each member would pay dues each
month according to his or her ability.
A little pin with the initials “S. S.
B.” would be appropriate for a badge.
Some of the members should go to
see the sick and needy and find out
what they need, and all members of
the Club together, help them. If each
community could have such a Club
the rules should be:
(1) Have some certain place and
time to meet.
(2) Give as much to the Club as
you are able.
(3) Care for the sick and needy.
(4) Love each other and be kind
to dumb animals.
I will close hoping to win a prize.
—Mattie Lou Munroe, Felton, Ga.,
R. F. D. 1.
(This letter might have won a
prize, but the writer does not say
how old she is.)
DO YOUR BEST.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l want to try
to write to the Sunny South Brother
hood, and as this is my first time, I
want to do the best I can. I think
the best thing we can do is to help
the sick and the poor people who
cannot help themselves. And if any
body wants to help these people, just
let them send in the money to The
Jeffersonian at Thomson, Ga. Well,
as this is my first time I will close
and if I see this in print, will come
again. Hoping to win one of your
prizes.—Your new friend, Joe Sprat
lin, Newnan, Ga., R. F. D. 4.
WE WILL DO THESE THINGS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l think to form
a Junior branch of the Sunny South
Brotherhood as suggested, would be
nice. With such a Brotherhood, we
could do a lot of home Mission Work.
For the crippled and unfortunate
Shut-ins, we could buy rolling chairs,
crutches, clothing, *hooks, and do
many things to cheer them up. We
could furnish for the sick medicine,
food, and other things; keep them
from the poor house in various ways,
and do deeds of kindness, speak
words of love, and make life worth
living for those who have no hope.
The work should be done by com
mittees presided over by Thos. E.
Watson and Daddy Jim as “Booster”.
Have committees in every community
to find and report the conditions to
Daddy Jim. A button with a rising
sun in the center and the words
“Sunny South Brotherhood” around
the edges would make a nice badge.
All members should pledge them
selves to do all they can for the
JUNIOR BROTHERHOOD
needy; to be kind to dumb animals;
to protect the song birds; to take
special interest in one unfortunate
person.—Your friend, Vicie Pierce,
Murrayville, Ga., Rt. 1.
THE PRIZE-WINNERS:
First Prize— Robert McGinley, 65
Beecher St., Atlanta, Ga., 12 years
old.
Second Prize Gladys Smith,
Route 3, Bartow, Ga., 13 years old.
Third Prize —John C. Ray, Route
1, Eufaula, Ala., 14 years old.
There were a number of other
good letters, but the writers did not
mention their ages. Our Junior
Brotherhood may be the making, in
a spiritual sense, of many a good
hearted, careless lad.

PLAIN TRUTH
A MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 32 PAGES
By J. A. SCARBORO,
A Sou of Georgia, Minister and
Student.
This Magazine is digging up and
exposing corruption and graft in
“Missions”. Its Editor has studied
the subject fifteen years, published
two books on the subject and knows
what he is doing. Dr. J. N. Hall,
late Editor of the Baptist Flag, the
most -widely circulated Baptist pa
per in the South, with whom Scar
boro was associated as Editor of
that paper, said of him: “J. A. Scar
boro is the best informed man on
missions in America.” The cham
pions of the present system have
declined to meet him in both press
and on rostrum. His Magazine is
full of facts, evidence and argu
ments which can not be refuted. He
is Treasurer of the General Asso
ciation of Baptist Churches, and has
the confidence and enjoys the en
dorsement of his brethren. He is
Pastor of one of the best churches
in the land and just in his prime
and in the thickest of the battle for
truth and righteousness.
