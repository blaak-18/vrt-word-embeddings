rights of the original sovereign to
eminent domain to the full extent of
the estate, goods and chattels named
in the contract, to the party of the
second part, the incorporated opera
tors of the franchise, and the sooner
we realize our true situation and stop
the fight in courts for control, where
the chances are against us, the better
it will be for us and posterity.
It is true the question of the sover
eign rights of the people
to control public service cor
porations has never been an issue
to be decided before any court. Judge
Lochren’s decision that the law or or
dinance demanding six fares for twen
ty-five cents declared unconsti
tutional in this, that if it was en
forced the earnings of the company
would be reduced so low it would not
pay lawful interest on their invest
ment, the result of which would be to
force such a shrinkage in the earning
capacity of the company’s property
that it would actually confiscate it
by reducing its market valuation. It
need not surprise anyone if the Su
preme Court sustains that decision.
But whether they do or not, there
can not be any question about their
decision when the public service cor
porations base their fight on their
sovereign rights to eminent domain
which they have obtained from the
dominion, who by the power inherent
in them, have granted without spe
cific reservation to the public service
corporations all sovereign rights to
the length and breadth by marks on
the ground. To the certain territory
described in the charter, the people
will be held strictly to the contract.
We have no doubt, what will be the
final result. This is where we find
ourselves and this is the grip the bear
has on us and with whom we are
wrestling with. Now, how will we,
and who will help us let go of the
bear? That is the question the people
must settle. Not in the courts, on
contracts signed, sealed and delivered
which give to the public service cor
porations a monopoly, but by a civil
revolution this is the remedy. All
powerful monopolies are the out
growth of laws which have granted
to them special privileges by which
the monopolies are able to oppress
the public.
The people must demand and
unite in that demand that no more
franchises be given away and that
such as cannot be taken over to them
selves should be paralleled and force
the public service corporations to com
pete in rates for business.
The national laws which have crea
ted a money, a land and transporta
tion monopolies, must be repealed,
and the high tariff laws which are
the basis of monopolies of all neces
saries and luxuries of life must be re
pealed and a tariff for revenue sub
stituted.
The nation must coin and issue all
the money of the union direct to the
people, pay off all bonds and stop the
interest, make internal improvements,
among them lines of transportation,
and set the people at work construct
ing them. Issue treasury notes, a full
legal tender with which to pay the
people for their services. These trea
sury notes would go into the channels
of trade and stay there and would
never cost one cent of interest for all
time.
Now the people pay compound in
terest for every dollar of currency
Ofye Jeffersonian
that circulates. First they pay inter
est on the bonds on which the curren
cy of the national banks are based,
and then we pay interest to the banks
on the currency for thirty, sixty or
ninety days, thus compounding the
interest from four to twelve times per
annum. All monopolies are the crea
tures of special privileges granted to
them by the law making power who
are hired men and paid for their ser
vices by the people, but instead of
serving them they serve the trusts
and betray the people into the hands
and the mercies of the trusts.
We have not got time nor space to
illustrate or call attention to but one
of the many examples of the betrayal
of the people, and that is their betray
al to the money trust.
The constitution of the United
States provides among several other
things, in Article I, Section 8, that
Congress shall coin (create) money.
This is the special province of that
branch of our national government.
Now, note the result of the labors of
the people’s hired men. They create
the currency (money) which is to
circulate, the legal representative of
all values and then straightway they
go and make a free gift of the whole
thing to the money trust (the national
banks), of whom the people have to
borrow everv dollar used for cash
payments that they use in all business
in the United States, paying the banks
compound interest for the money
which actually belongs to the people,
because it was created by their hired
men. It is by such class legislation
that millionaires, trusts and combines
are created by the thousands annually,
and millions of tramps are turned
loose to tramp, beg, steal or starve
and many other millions toil to keep
from becoming objects of charity,
while old age is creeping on they are
not able to get more ahead than will
furnish the necessaries of life in a
country with such wonderful natural
opportunities as ours. Are such con-’
ditions proof of the wisdom of a free
people?' The people can never pros
per until these unjust, inequitable
laws are repealed. —The North-East
Argus.
