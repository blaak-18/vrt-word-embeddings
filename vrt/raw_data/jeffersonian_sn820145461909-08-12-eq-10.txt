THE SAME PISTOL
By Opie Reed
OUNDS of mourning came from
an old log house on a hill. I
stopped near the roadside at
s
the foot of the hill. Numerous
people, seemingly dressed in their
Sunday clothes, stood about the
house. I stood under the shelter of
the timber, lest my observation
might be regarded as unfriendly es
pionage, for mountain people, with
all their impulsive generosity, are pe
culiar. Especially so is the East Ten
nesseean. A stranger who manifests
the slightest interest in the East Ten
nesseean’s affairs is often looked upon
with inimical, and sometimes danger
ous suspicion.
While I stood gazing at the scene,
a weird song, a sort of fall-of-the
year chant, arose. I knew that it
was not wholly a service of religious
devotion, for at times the distressing
wail of a woman would rise above the
chant. Suddenly I heard a groan,
and, looking about, I saw a man sit
ting on a log. His face was buried
in his hands. I approached him. He
looked up with a start. His face,
though young, was haggard, and his
large black eyes had a hollowness of
expression.
“What is going on up at th®
house?” I asked.
“Dan Beasley’s funeral,” he re
plied.
“He must have been quite a promi
nent man,” I remarked.
“He wa’n’t so prominent as he was
noble uv natur’. His love fur folks
in general was as bright an* beauti
ful as a mountain sunrise.”
“What did he die of?”
“A bullet.”
“What! was any one so depraved
as to kill so good a man?”
“Yes.”
“The people have surely mobbed
irm ?”
“No.”
“Then they can not find him?”
“They’ll find him in a half hour
from now.”
“Then they are after him?”
‘No, but he will meet the funeral
procession.”
“To give himself up?” I asked, in
surprise.
“He won’t say nothin’ about that.”
“You seem to know a great deal
about him.”
“I do. lam the man.”
I looked at him in horror.
“I don’t wonder that you look at
me so, he said. “There will never
be another kind look turned upon me
until I am dead. Then my po’ old
mother will look at me kindly.”
“Why did you kill him?” I asked.
“I went over to a still-house tuther
evenin’, an’ he come over atter me.
I was drunk when he got thar. He
came up to me mighty kind an’ says,
‘Sam, le’s go home?’
“ ‘No,’ says I, ‘a passul uv the boys
will be here putty soon, an’ we are
goin’- to play seven-up.’
“ ‘You’ve got no money to lose,’ he
said.
“ ‘Wall, I’ve got as much as you
have,’ I said. Then he put his arm
’round me an’ began to beg me.
Somehow, I got mad, for all uv a sud
den .it 'peared like he had always
3effersonian
stood in my way, an’ I thought es it
wa’n’t for him I would be a great
man. As I stood lookin’ at him he
smiled. I know now that it was the
warm smile uv love; but then I
thought it was the cold grin uv hate.
“ ‘Dan,’ said I, ‘go on away or I’ll
hurt you.’
“ ‘Sam,’ he replied, ‘you couldn’t
hurt me.’
“ ‘Couldn’t I?’
“ No.’
“ ‘l’ll show you.’ I snatched out
my pistol, shoved it against his breast
an’ fired. In a minit I was sober. I
stood lookin’ at him. I heard the
boys cornin’. I waited till they come,
an’ then I fell upon Dan, kissed him
time an’ agin, an’ then ran into the
woods. At first the boys was so
’stonished that they didn’t follow me,
but putty soon I heard them yell, an’
then I knowed that if they cotch me
they would hang me. I ran away
an’ hid in a cave, an’ stayed there
until jest now. I wanted to see the
funeral. Dan was my twin brother.”
Again he buried his face in his
hands. Again the wail of a heart
broken woman arose above the mel
ancholy chant.
“So you intend to give yourself
up,” I said.
“I will meet the funeral,” he re
plied, without looking up.
“The procession is coming down
the hill,” I said after a few moment’s
silence. He arose and stood with
his arms folded. There was no
hearse or wagon. The coffin was
borne by four strong men. In the
procession there came an old and
tottering woman, leaning on the arm
of an aged man. The murderer sank
upon his knees, remained for a few
moments, and then stepped out into
the road in front of the procssion.
The men who bore the coffin stopped.
The murderer drew a pistol, and, ex
claiming, “Mother, the same pistol!”
placed the weapon to his head and
fired. A heart-broken woman totter
ed forward and fell on the corpse.
BUSTED HIS GALL.
An old darkey got on the train at
Haw River N. C. After he had se
cured a seat and gotten quiet he fell
asleep. His mouth flew open and he
lay back snoring. A drummer se
curea some powdered quinine, and
using a cigarette paper as a funnel,
he sprinkled about an ounce into the
open pit. It took several minutes
for the bitter taste to arouse the
darkey. When he did awake a look
of terror overspread his face. He
yelled and called for the conductor.
He said, “Cap n, I’m going to die. As
soon as ye get dese kyars stopped,
send word to Malinda and tell her to
bury dis ole nigger at de foot of de
old pine tree an’ tell her to be good
to de chillun an’ don’t forget old
Jim.”
The conductor stopped Jim and
asked him what was the matter and
where.
“Tain’t no pain, boss,” wailed Jim,
“it’s my gall done busted, and I’se
gwine to die sure.”—Farm and Fac

How He Got Rid
of Consumption
Remarkable Rescue of Prominent In
diana Man. A Matter of Life-and-
Death Interest to All Throat
and Lung Sufferers
For Benefit of Jeffersonian Readers, He
Tells How He Cured Himself at
Home—Costs Nothing to Try.
“I think I owe it to all sufferers of
lung and throat trouble and consump
tion to tell them some mighty good
news, a sure way to cure themselves
right at home with little trouble,” said
E. S. Stroh, of Angola, Ind., yesterday,
as he passed through.
“Coming from me, probably, some
people might doubt this, but let me tell
you,” he said, as his 66-year-old face
flushed with a resurrected, youthful
smile, “over two years ago I was a
weazened-up wreck, a consumptive at
63. Three lung specialists passed me
up. Every day I would cough up about
a pint. I had chills and fever every
afternoon. I could hardly eat, even the
plainest food, coughed nearly all night,
and was down to 137 pounds when I
hit on the cure. Well, you see me now.
I weigh 166 pounds, frisky as a boy at
66, can do a big day’s work, and eat
like a prince.
“Now I am not trying to boost any
body, but I must give credit where
credit is due. Dr. J. Lawrence Hill,
499 Hill Building, Jackson, Mich., the
well known lung specialist of America
and probably so far the only success
ful one, cured me. That was two years
ago. I have just had my lungs ex
amined again and there is no trace of
consumption nor danger of its return
ing. Dr. Hill makes a specialty of
treating throat and lung sufferers at a
distance who have not the means of
visiting his office personally. That’s
the way he cured me, and I know of
many others who had one foot in the
grave almost, brought back to life by
what he calls his Rational Treatment.
It certainly is a wonder.
“I wish every reader of your paper
who has weak lungs, catarrh of the
bronchial tubes or catarrh in any form,
chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic
hacking cough, loss of flesh, night
sweats, hemorrhages, soreness or pain’
in the chest or under the shoulder
blades or any other deadly symptom of
consumption, to send to Dr. Hill for his
trial package. This treatment checks
at once further progress of the dis
ease, develops atrophied cell tissues
and brings on new resisting power, ap
petite, flesh and good health.” Fill out
