Thie anprecedented snuccess with which
the Times hase met, siehee its establish
ment, is convincing evidence that the
people of the West and South, fully ap
preeiate the efforts of a journal, which,
m aHdition to i1 enterprise as a news
paper, has the courage to boldly declare
and constantly maintain the principles
of its political faith.
The publie journald mostly deserving of
Democratic support is the one thlht, in
addition to being a full and faithful and
consistent advocate of Desholratie prin
siplcs. A Democratic newspaper is the
newspaper for Democrats to support, and
the idea sometimes sought to be incleca
ted by those who have an interest of their
own lau doing so that the people must go
outside their party organ to "tind the
news," is absurd ansul irrational. There
jno sort of incompatibility whatever
between the political and non-political
journal as to the matter of news; many
of the paplers now published throughout
the country, and especially valuabe for
i;he amount and variety of their intel
ligence, being"also known for the ability
and earnestness with which they chan
pion their peculiar party views. Hence
all things elie being equal, it is manifest
Sythe duty oflDemocrats to linmit their
newspaper patronage to such as are of
their own way of thinkiug, and not to
quanmter their means on those that wage
eonseant warfare upon their established
convictions.
It-is ouirdesire to see the Times in the
hand ofall D)emocr;ts, and every well
wisher of the Government throughout
the Jaud, and in ordet that this may be
done, we are now offering the -following
extraordinary inducements to those who
will interest themselves andl act in the

WILD' OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper !
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirist ouf
the day.
\Vild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established hlnmorous and
s;;tirical p:per of the country. It was
started, and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting filly as it flies, and showing up
the political' and social shams by its
ma.:terly cartoons and pungenlt editorials,
it a'lhieved even greater success than
before, and was reeognized as thi ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
detmaid, and now publish Wihl Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic imirits, be
iu:; the first successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the ariists especially engaged
io furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomans Worth lHopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Junilp, Keettels,
Stneckhardt, Day, Poland, antd several
others who are yet known to fanme.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squihs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illusl.atino:
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. L. Walker's Callfornta
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
TERSt" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the historj of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of VIN
EGAR BITTERS in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of DR. WALK
ER'S VINEGAR BITTERS are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.
(Gr atsu-. . .. a.u, j ,j,,
VINEGAR 1ITT"tERIS the lltost wondler
fiul Invigorant that ever sustailed
the sinking system.
No Persoli cill lake these Bit.
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones.are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans w ste ueyond repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi.
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Ried, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, RHo
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to DRI. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
BITTERs, as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the simne time
stimulating the secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs.
Fortify the body against dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
Vine;sR BrI'rrEus. No epidemtic can
take hold of :a system thus fire-arulnted.

tion of the Heart, luflannuation of the
Lungs, Pain in the region of thile Kidlneys,
and a hundred other painful symptomts,
are the olffspringsof l)yspepsia. One bot
tle will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scroflula, or King's Evil, Whitoe
Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled
Neck, Goitre, Scrofulous Inflaiunmations,
Indolent Inflamnations, Mercurial affcc
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyest etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, WALKtn's VIx
EGAR BITTRRs have Shown their great cur
ative powers in the most obstinate and
intractable eases.
For Inflannanstory and Chronfe
RhenniatismGout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Internmittent Fevers, D)iseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
these Bitters have no equal. Such )Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated lBhlol.
Mechanical Diseases.-Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumabers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters aind
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of WA.IlKma's
VINEGAR BITTERS occalionally.
For Shin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt-Rheum, Blotches, Spots, Pim
ples, Pustiles, Boils, Carbuncles, Ring
worms, Scald-head, Sore Eyes, E-sipe
las, Itch, Scdrfs, Discolorations of the
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
Pin, Tape, and 6thler WVornm,
lurking in the system of so many thon
sands, are effectually destrnoyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
niifuges, no anthelminitics will free the
srstemn from worms like these Bitters.
PorFeiaI0leC otiplaints, in young
or old, married or himgle, at the dawn of
womanhood, or the turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvenment is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whopever you find its impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of the system will follow.
