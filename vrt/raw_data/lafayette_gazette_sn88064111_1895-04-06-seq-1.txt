SEA SERPENTS.
A Sea-Faring Man Tells of Those
Off the Coset of Brazil
"The ocean off the northeast coast of
Brazil," said the bronzed seafaring
mhan, "is a regular marine jungle.
Whtrthe dense forests and inaccessible
-'asnesses of its vast area are to the
land of that interesting country the
submerged tangles of coral growth are
to the water off the northeast coast
of Brazil. If one might see them and
thread their unknown labyrinths such
wonders would confront him at every
turn as never existed in any wood or
swamp or jungle on which the sun has
ever shone. Those submarine coral for
ests are the homes of sea monsters be
yond belief. There the sea serpent
lives. There it brings forth and rears
its young. There, and there only.
When I hear landsmen laugh and de
ride- the idea of there being such a
thing as a sea serpent I pity them and
say:
"'Alas, what pent-up lives you live!
fow narrow is the limit of the things
you know! If you might only go to the
Brazilian coast, off Cape San Roque, in
latitude, say, five degrees, thirteen
minutes north, and longitude thirty
five degrees west! Belay me! Uut
what Sights you'd see."
"No sea serpent? I thought so once
myself. I don't know that I should
pity- those pent-up landsmen after all,
for if I had not shipped as able seaman
on the bark Pauline of London, Capt.
Drewar, on that July of 1875, it is like
ly that I would be just as pent-up and
ignorant now as they are.
"Know you, there are no ports on
that part of the Brazilian coast off
Cape San Roque; no place for a ship to
go in, even if there was anything there
that a ship should have business in
going in to do. But the bark Pauline
went in there. Singular about that,
sir. We were looking for whales inci
dentally. If, in those days, after doing
our legitimate-business, we might man
age to overcome a whale, then we were
just so much in, from the captain
down. So on this trip, having dis
charged what we had on board, and
taken on what we were to take on,
Capt. Drewar said to the first mate, and
I heard him:
" 'Mate,' said he, 'we have three days
to spare. What do you think of sailin'
up and lookin' over the mysteries?'
"Now, mind you, the mysteries is the
northeast coast of Brazil, where there
are no ports, and where every sailor
knows the sea serpent has its only
home.
" 'Cap'n,' says the mate, touching his
hat, 'why not?'
" 'Then it's a go?' says the cap'n.
" 'The goen'est kind, sir!' says the
mate.
"And we sailed up along the coast.
Being a man who was not a sailor
through necessity, I may have been
more alert as to the things that might
occur on this recreation voyage than
was the ordinary seaman doing his
routine duty a-shipboard for his living.
Anyhow, one day, as we were oft Cape
San Roque, in an unknown sea so far
as commercial interests are concerned,
the lookout shouted:
" 'Waterspout!'
"Now, s'pose it had been a water
spout? What's a waterspout? There's
nothing in a waterspout to scare any
body. As far as I was concerned per
sonally I didn't care whether it was a
waterspout or an earthquake. As a
matter of fact, I think I would have
been glad if it had been an all-envel
oping earthquake, so far as I was per
sonally concerned, for I was way down
in the dumps. It was because of that
I went to sea. I loved the girl so much
and she threw me overboard, and I
but let that pass.
" 'WVaterspout!' shouted the lookout.
"'Where away?' sung out the cap
tain.
" 'Three points to the sta'boardl'
shouted the lookout.
"Sure enough, sir; there it was. At
least there was what the lookout said
was a waterspout. It wasn't a spout
though. It seemed to be a great foun
tain spurting out of the sea. It shot
up as high as a ship's mast, undulated
there a moment like a huge watery
column swayed by wind, then dropped
back to the ocean level; instantly rose
again to its tremendous height, glis
tened in the sun like a lofty white pin
nacled rock; swayed and fell; rose,
glistened, swayed, fell, all in quick
succession, each fall to the water being
followed by the upward splashing of
great spumes of foaming sea. Around
this eccentric fountain several big black
objects moved here and there, quickly,
and without apparent aim.
" 'Waterspout be blowedi' the cap
tain said
"Then he seized his glass and gazed
through it at the strange affair. His
eyes had scarcely taken in the scene,
enlarged and made distinct by his
glass, when lI saw him turn pale. linut
he Pouldn't cease looking.
'" By the prongscf Neptune's tridentl
said he. 'A sea serpent! A frightful
monster of the deep, armored with
hideous bony scales, in mortal combat
with some leviathan that has crossed
its path! No!' the captain still shout
ing, pale and trembling. 'No! Not
combat! The leviathan is not fighting!
It is struggling to escape! Mighty as
it'is, it is but prey of the awful serpent
-like sparrow swooped down upon by
hawkl It is a whale-a whale the like
in size of which I've never seen in all
my forty years of sailing on the salty
seas! His girth a lead line fifty fathoms
long would scarcely once go round, and
yet the serpent is coiled about it full a
score of times! What seemed to be
spouting geysers from the sea are but
the rising and the falling of the free
parts of the serpent, this one now rear
ing aloft the monster's fearful headi
that one now being his convoluting ex
tremity, tipped with an awful barb!
They rise and fall by the terrible im
pulse of the serpent's assault upon the
whale, which he spins and whirls and;
churns in the deep as a mill wheel
might be spun by the rush of impelling
waters! The black objects are other
whales, agitated and terror-stricken
spectators of their mighty fellow's
deadly environmentl Hark!' the cap
tain still with the glass to his eye, and
growing paler and paler.
"It was not necessary for us to heark
en. A deaf man could almost have'
heard the sounds that came to us over
the sea from the scene of that awful
contest. Boom! boom! boom! Like the
hoarse intonations of a saluting can
non.
" 'By the rusty key of Davy Jones'
locker!' the captain shouted. 'The aw
ful compress of that serpent's coil has
bust the whale! Three times the great
leviathan's tremendous bulk has bust,
with a noise like thunder! And now
they sink-the horrible serpent has
gone below-to gorge his mighty plun
der!'
"The glass fell from the captain's
hand. Seasoned as he was by forty
years afloat, and familiar with the ap
palling things the boundless ocean
breeds, he fainted dead away upon the
deck. In the excitement following the
captain's collapse all save the fetch
ing of him to was forgotten, and when
at last he was out of his swoon and
somewhat himself again the whales
that had been terror-stricken witnesses
of the sea serpent's capture of thlir
mate had disappeared. This chagrined
the captain. According to his descrip
tion of them, any one of these whales
would have been an unheard-of prize.
But they had slipped .away and were
out of eight.
"'Well chase them!' said the cap.
tain. 'I vill not leave these mysterious
seas until I kill a whale!'
"So we sailed in the presumed wake
of the whales. Two days we sailed.
Not a sight or 'race of whale. Then
the captain changed his course and
sailed sou'west. The third day we
sighted something. At first sight and
for a long time as we approached it
we took it for the projecting summit
of a coral reef, formed like a flattened
pyramid and covering many yards of
the ocean's surface. In height it rose,
as it seemed to me, almost to the eleva
tion of our mainmast. We would have
sailed by it without comment or fur
ther thought, but just as our course
brought about a hundred feet aport
there was a sudden movement in the
mass. It began to unfold, and to our
horror we saw the frightful head of
the sea serpent rear itself and shoot
upward until the fierce eyes of the
monster glared down at us from a tre
mendous height. Before the captain
could shout an order the serpent sank
like a falling meteor into the sea, and
with a roaring hiss rushed toward our
vessel, its monstrous head held high
above the water, its jaws apart like the
opening to some great cavern, its eyes
glaring fire.
"'To your axes!' shouted the captain.
"Every man of us seized an ax. The
sea monster quickly covered the space
between where he lay and our vessel,
and thrust his horrible head over the
gunwale. As he did so he stopped as if
brought up by something that held him
back. And something did. Away out
on the water, where his middle was,
his body loomed up like a water-logged
wreck. But we had no time to wonder
at that. It was my privilege to strike
the awful serpent the first blow. My
ax sank to the helve inhisback. Quick
ly every sailor followed with telling
blows, until we hacked and hewed the
monster into his death throes. He
died hard. His struggles shook the
ship until she groaned and creaked.
But we killed him. I do not hesitate
to say, though, that if ituhad not been
for that great hulking thing that held
him handicapped amidships, so to
speak, the chances are that he would
never have fallen victim to our fury.
Rather, I think, we would have been
engulfed, perhaps ship and all, by the
terrible monster. After we had slain
the serpent a boat was manned and
rowed out to see what the looming
mass was that had indirectly encom
passed his destruction. We chopped
the, floating carcass of the dead sea
monster open. Lol there was the tre
mendous whale the captain had de
scribed to us as having been the victim
of that deadly afray three days before!
Then, to be sure, there was great re
joicing among us Such a prize as that
had never been taken in any sea. And
we sailed away from that mysterious
coast rich and proud.
"No sea serpents? Let those who
think so take some weeks out of their
pent-up lives and cruise along the
northeastuoast of Brazil, of Cape San
Rogue, and their little knowledge will
be shamed!" said the bronzed seafaring
man.-Ed Mott, in N. Y. Sun.

TERRIBL'Y MAIMED.
s Woman1 W ho Lived or Years Without
Hands., Feet, N or Earn.
Cases of double am tation are by no
means rare, being gerrally the result
of railway or machinery accidents.
Cases of triple amputation are met
with, but are very scajrce. Of quadru
ple amputations, where all the limbs
halve been operatedupon, there is only
one case on record.
The subject's name was Elizabeth
Robertson. When twenty-one years of
age she was admitted to the Duncan
royal infirmary May 23, 1869, under
the care of Mr. John Berg, who per
formed the subsequent operations.
She was found to be suffering from
mortification of both hands, extending
as far as the wrists; of both feet, in
volving the lower half of the legs, and
lf the tips of the ears and nose.
After being.kept a few weeks..n lib
eral diet to prepare her for the ordeal
which she was obliged to undergo, both
legs were amputated some inches above
the ankles June 17. July 2 the tip of
her nose and small portions of her ears
were removed. The 19th both arms
were amputated above the wrists.
She never had a bad symptom after
ward. The stumps of the limbs healed
soundly, and were able to bear a great
amount of pressure. The 16th of OCto-
ber she was discharged and left for
London, where she was fitted by lleath
er Bigg with artificial limbs for the
four extremities.
The success which followed upon
their adaptation took the numerous
professional men who had the oppor
tunity of examining her by surprise.
After short practice, aided at first by a
go-cart, the patient became able to
stand erect, and to move from place to
place with but slight support,
walking, in fact, with a certain
degree of facility and comfort. She
rapidly acquired such control over
and such . readiness of practice
with her hands as to feed herself and
carry vessels with liquids to her lips
and brow; to crochet with great facili
ty and precision; to pick up articles
even so small as a pin, and, finally, to
write with most legibility.
From the time the appliances were
put on down to her death-that is, dur
ing a period of fifteen years-she main
tained herself by crochet work, having
a large sale for her work, not only on
account of the excellence with which
it was done, but also because it was
accounted a great curiosity. Her maj
esty, the queen, graciously interested
herself in the case, and presented Mrs.
Robertson several times with dona
tions, besides frequently purchasing
articles that she had worked.
On her death in 1884 the artificial
limbs were purchased back again from
her friends by Heather BIigg, who pre
sented them to the royal college of
surgeons, in whose museum in Lin
coln's Inn Fields they may now be
seen.-Tit-Bite.
THEY NEVER SPEAK NOW.
How Unlucky Mr. Jones lanaged to Of
fend IMsls Brown Past Forgiveness.
She had admired the men, and though
the years had come and gone and she
was still Miss Brown, her admiration
had not abated. On the contrary, it
had increased. She was of the modern
woman school also, or at least wanted
people to think so, and as for herself,
she thought she was intensely interest
ing. To young Mr. Jones she had been
lately addressing herself, and young
Mr. Jones didn't like it a little bit. In
fact, young Mir. Jones usually fled
when she appeared, but on this occa
sion she had taken him unawares and
was now holding him in her thrall, in
a pretty alcove in the conservatory.
Just beyond them sat a pretty girl to
whom Mr. Jones was devoted, and he
longed to get over to her and oust the
vapid youth who young AMr. Jones was
sure was making desperate love to her.
But Miss Brown held on like a turtle.
"Do you know. Mr. .lones," she was
saying in her most intense fashion,
"that the modern woman is an ideal
to me?"
"No, really, I don't know,' confessed
Mr. Jones much against hais will.
"But it is true," she continued,
"and, oh, Mr. Jones, some of the wom
en .we read of in books, see on the
stage, and hear of in daily life appeal
so strongly to me."
"Yes?" said Mr. Jones with a rising
inflection.
"Indeed, yes," she responded. Then
with deep earnestness she turned to
him:
"Did you know, - Mr. Jones," she
whispered almost tragically, "that I
am a woman with a past?"
"Well," he replied in an absent
minded sort of way, "the most women
who have lived forty years weren't
born yesterday, don't you know?"
Later in the evening young Mr.
Jones told the pretty girl how it hap
pened that Miss Brown would forever
thereafter be to him only a stranger.

Teeth and Tongue Comblned.
Teeth and tongue are combined in
the case of garden snails and slugs.
There are, it appears, on the tongue of
the common snail 135 row-s of teeth
and 105 in each row, making a total of
14,175 teeth. This is understood to be
surpasse4 in the case of the largest
British land snail, in which the tongue
has 140 rows of teeth, with 151 in each
row, making a .total of .21,140 teeth.
One of the slug family has 28,800 on
the tongue, disposed in 160 rows, with
180 in each. There are also many
fishes in which this combination of
teeth and tongue occurs. A glance
into the mouth of the pike or perch re
veals an array of teeth sonumerous as
to be crowded, not only on the jaws,
but upon the tongue, palate, floor and
sides of the mouth, and upon the gill
arches and back of the tlhroat. The
whelk has a ribbonlike tongue, con
tained in a proboscis, with which it
bores holes in the shells of the mol
lusks which form its food, and this
tongue has strong, sawlike teeth on
the edges, with rows of finer ones be

also are covered nmoro or less tlhickly

PRESERVING THE TEETH.
Ceaseless Care Necessary to Ward Off a
Troublesomne ,outh Trouble.
What is commonly known among
dentists as Riggs disease of the gums,
is a prevalent evil. It is a recession of
the flesh from the teeth, which is
scarcely perceptible to the sufferer,
and requires a skilled eye to detect it
even in an advanced stage of the com
plaint. Its danger lies in the fact that
the enamel on the teeth is several
times thicker above and below the skin
than under it. Now, what is called the
normal line of the gum, the dentine or
unenameled portion is not exposed,
and nature provides the hehvier shell
coating to protect the visible part, not
only from cold and climatic conditions
but from the danger generated by
small microbes floating about the
mouth after eating.
Therefore, when the gums recede
from the teeth toward the root, the
dentine is left a helpless prey to every
,acid the mouth contains, and decay be
gins at the top, cutting off all hope of
saving the lower part.
This recession, as I said, is rarel3
visible except to the dentist. Its prob
able effect is slight bleeding of the
gums whenever a stiff brush is used,
while the teeth seemingly remain in
-their normal condition.
The cause of the irritation is tartar
poison.
The saliva of the mouth is partly
formed of phosphate of lime, which, by
chemical action, is converted into tar
tar. This fastens itself upon the roots
of the teeth and irritating the tender
membrane causes a bleeding, sore con
dition.
In this weakened, porous condition,
these innumerable microbes that lurk
in the cavities of the mouth, float out
from their hiding places and seize upon
the wounded line of skin. This is the
fatal condition, and only the most care
ful treatment dislodges them. The
taxtar subftance becomes poisonous
and the whole eats its way into the
gums, which sluff and gradually de
crease.
SOf course, this disease is not common
to every mouth. It is caused, primarily,
by an acid condition of the saliva,
hereditary in some constitutions, and
Sits earliest arrester is an anticeptic.
SShould, however, any bleeding occur
Sin brushing, a dentist's help should be
Scalled in.
The treatment for it continues from
six months to a year, and even then
Sthe disease is only arrested, the re
I establishment of the gum is never as
sured.
SThe nature of the disease is so in
sidious that prudent women should see
I to it that the mouth is frequently ex
I amined. Any dentist can tell whether
a person is inclined to this condition,
and at once remove the tartar and ad
vise an antiseptic that destroys the
- microbe.
In fact, some such preparation should
be frequently used to retain a healthy
condition of every part of the mouth.

WITHOUT A WIRE.
leoar-1)istanee Talkling That Saved a Dalt
lonliat. I
Tales are plenty of long distances l
over which men's voices have been con- b
veyed by the medium of placid water. a
An Adirondack guide tells of having
talked in ordinary tones, on a very still a
day, with a companion a mile and a p
half distant at the other end of a lake, o
and another guide caps this story with t
one of yells which were heard and re- a
turned near a water extent of three
miles. These tales are quite outdone e
by a well-authenticated story told by h
Carlotta, once the most famous woman
balloonist in the world. In her story C
air instead of water was the medium, c
and the distance of the conversation
was four miles. It took place a mile
above the outskirts of St. Louis some
years ago.
"It was an mronautic.exhibition," r
says Carlotta in tellingthe story. "and e
a young man named White, who was
inexperienced in ballooning, had
agreed to make an ascension. I had
already gone up and was quietly drift
ing east on an easy air current when
he started out. lie had had enough
experience to know how to handle the
valves and sand bags, and he intended =
to go up a mile or so and then descend
easily. Now, the upper air is full of
varying currents. You may be going
due west at half a mile altitude, and
when you get up a few hundred yards
further you may strike a current that
carries you due east. MIr. White
checked his upward career in a west
bound draught, so that when he finally
drifted out of that current into mine
we were a good long distance apart.
"I always have a powerful glass with
me when I make an ascension. When
I turned this on him I saw that he was
in trouble. His balloon had twisted a
little, in such a way that I judged it
was likely to twist more, and he was
clambering around the ropes trying te
right it, but without muech apparent
conception of what was best to do. I
was frightened for him, for when the
bag of a balloon turns too much the
gas begins to escape rapidly, and the
results are likely to be serious. I knew
thit voices could be heard a long way
in the air, for I had often heard people
a mile below *me shouting, so without
knowing how far the two balloons
were apart, I decided to hail the other
one. I gathered all my breath and
shouted:
'" 'Hello! Hello! Hello!'
"Then I turned my glass on the other
balloon again. Up where the air is so
clear as it is a mile above the earth
one can see at great distances with I
wonderful distinctness. Through my
glass I could see lMr. White start and
look all around . him. That was
quite awhile after I had shouted.
lie didn't seem to understand
where the voice came from, but finally I
I saw him put his hands into his I
mouth, evidently making a speaking
trumpet of them. I waited and wait- 1
edr, and was just about to shout again 1
when the huge gas bag above me be- l
gun to thrill with sounds.' They
seemed to buzz along its sides and
diffulse in the air, only to collect and
come whirring and rumbling down the
funnel to be poured into my ears, and
they formed in a tone that seemed
made up of a million other tones.
"'Hello! Where-are you?'
"It was the most peculiar sound I
had ever heard. When it had scat
tered itself into silence I took out my I
watch and timing myself, shouted:
" 'Throw out one sandbag. I'l1 come
to you.'
"Forty seconds later my balloon be
gan to vibrate again, finally forming
the words:
" 'All right. In trouble.'
"There was method in my telling
him to throw out the sandbag,, as it
was afterward of use. I threw out a
number myself, for I reckoned that a
little above ame I would find a current
to carry me toward MIr. White. This I
did, and was soon within a short dis
tance of him, aerially considered. The
trouble with his balloon was a
slight disarrangement of the ropes,
which I had myself experienced, so I
told him what to do, and lie was soon
all right. As I explained to him when
we reached the earth, we had been
talking over an aerial telephone, the
gas bags being the only material ob
jects up there collecting all the sounds
and acting as huge receivers."
" 'Well,' said he, 'you got me out of
a very bad scrape, but I never was so
scared in my life as when that voice
surrounded me. I thought the balloon
was talking, and that I had gone
crazy.
" 'It was a pretty long talk, said I;
'for allowing the voice to travel five
seconds to a mile by my timing we
must have been close to four miles
apart.' ,
S" 'That's simply impossible,' said he.
" 'Very vell,' I said. 'That's why I
told you to drop that sandbag. I
threw some out, too, and we can find
out how far they landed apart.
"It wasn't much trouble to find 'peo
ple who had found the bags and knew
- just where they were. Fortunately
they had landed near a railroad track,
Sso the distance estimating was made
easy for us. It was four miles and a
Squarter. I guess that is the record up

Asphyzis by Electriclty.
According to Prof. J. Kratter, of
Graz. who has for some time been per
forming experiments on the effect of
electrical shocks on animal life, death
a is most usually caused by sudden ces
a sation of respiration and consequent
e suffocation. During the suffocation
the heart continues its action. If the
s asphyxia lasts more than a certain
time, about two minutes, the heart
,f stops, this being a secondary phenome
non. Generally speaking, the animals
used-cats, dogs, rabbits and mice
n were not easily killed by 1600-2000
e volts alternating. The danger appears
to lie in the nervous system, and to de
. crease with the amount of brain de
e velopment. Frequently death occurs
, by momentary stoppage of the move
ment of the heart, but a slow cessa
tion of the heart's action, such as has
been observed in cases of human death,
was never observed. In no ease was
Sany anatomical alteration observable
d to w-hich death might be attributed,
but there are sometimes lesions, break
Sing of blood vessels, and the diagnosis
