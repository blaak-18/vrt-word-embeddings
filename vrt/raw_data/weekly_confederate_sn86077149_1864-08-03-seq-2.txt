The Election. -
We receive every d-.y, Utters expressing the
nprr. a ?usic;i of the citizens, that the deserters
a -id terit-s, wh nr iacrtisitg in some portions
r4' the State, with a purpose to present them
selves in t-be counties ot Raodoh.h, Moore, Yad
kin. Foisytb, nd other sections, with a view
toca.it their own votes', a&d ahso to control the
polls. This apprehension is well-fouuded for
we sec iu the Conservative of yesterday, the i
statement that vWo or three hundred deserters
, by comiar;ig them to laves, would have niaue

deserters and tcries propose t do tkp eleciii g j

have a claim upon their government to be se
cure in the privilege of voting-; and we-have
no doubt that steps are being taken to give se
curity where there day appear to be gan
ger. We advise all true men, no matter who
thoy vote fcr, to be prepared at the polls to
prevent an irruption on the ballot box by law
lees deserters aad tories ; and we again erjoin
upocjtbe government to take uch steps, wbere
evtr they have not already been taken, to make
the voters secure.

The Madness of a Fanatic ?
"The freedom of th bdiot-box is gone, no far
as the voting of tb soldiers are concerned! "
I'royretts, July i'9A.
Ths aoovc is th-j most wnnton insult to the
officer oud ' soldier who 'voted vesterdir, that
has yet been uttered What docs it s-iy ?
I -der ttKir charge?. TliO soldier, to veoni you
j have alluded in yvmr article, al.o u peat'eman,
' J rt
but a subordinate and a r-cognizer ot discipline
---but he is also a free mm and an independent
thinicor; and when you chnrge that he has
been intimidated to v.te, you blander for .be
is not afr.'iid of bullets. When you charge
tbftt be is afraid to vo'e, you slander, fur the
instiTicts of a free roan are peculiarly hi'.
And row let us tell you, Mr. Pennington,
thote mr'!i tht you saw march up Fayette vide
street f n yesterday, who are doicg provost
guard fiv d other like duties, nv tb? wounded
aiid ek in our hospit.ils, abb fsee mkn They
voted ar, free men---they march d as free iren
---find do you know what thry think -they
think that yoi end Mr. H Iden ought to ho
mude to march too. They think that yen have
done nothing worthy to ent'ole you to be ex
empt. And let us teil you anoiber thing, these
! soldiers whom vou and Mr. H olden traduce
! anioi.ig men.
j . , . , ,
! lou are entirely-mistaken as to the number
whovited. Ych say " Of course those ,w'ho
J did not vote at all, or nearly fill, are fcr Mr.
HoMen." We hope tbe soldiers will dispose
of this calumny and let the people of North
Carolina see how they regard these everlasting
inpu ts. Let them at onca, by certificates,
show tb3 freedom of this election.
. And Mr. PeMiicg'ou says "We will pub
lish tbe vote from tbe army as f t-t a3 received.?'
.Yet this morning there re dispatches flora
tberBiy, which we know he heard of, some
of which he has not published.
Further, says be, "As far as heard from, the
army vote is so sou 11 as scarcely to amount to
anything, and car.not atlect the result." Mis
taken ngMo. As far as heard from, it is large
and upi.niaious, and theirmy vote already
control the result
