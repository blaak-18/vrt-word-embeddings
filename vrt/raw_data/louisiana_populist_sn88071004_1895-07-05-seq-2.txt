FRui)AY. JIILZ' 4, M1894.
We have received the first three
issues of the Farmers Advocate.
recently established at Trinity,
La.. by that able, though peculiar
editor, Hugh Watson. It is inde
pendent in polities and filled with
interesting local news.
The gold bugs don't have to have
a gold platform. Oh no ! We've
already got the gold standard, and
all we have to do is to remain
divided-put straddles in our plat
forms, and the gold standard and
starvation will continue, or get
worse. Remember that.
The Herald is a seven column,
four page weekly just started at
Farmerville, La. It is neatly got
ton up, and is filled with sohlid edit
orials, correspondence and news,
and is Populist to the core. We
welcome it to the field, and wish
it much success.
The so-called People's Demands,
of 'lolfax, La., is "agin" the great
ew Orleans ballot reform conven
tion because it took free silver
along with ballot reform. Must
be "agin" free silver, Ed.; and if
you are, you could not find a more
effectual way of fighting it than
you are following. Just keep the
Ssilver forces divided-part in the
People's, part in the Democratic
and part in the Republican party
and the bloated, bond-holding gold
bugs will be able to make the toil
ing masses stand and deliver for
another four years.
But, Ed., how much do the
gold-bug pay you for this work ?
If they are not paying you, they
will do it, and handsomely too, and
they will lay you and let you stand
n the middle" of the road, too.
The Memphis silver convention
was quits a success in numbers,
enthusiasm and ability at the
pspeechs. It was a nmo-partisan

There i. only one tlin" ti:'t n:l
pIV'vlit It law for free (coinage of
'silver within twenty-four months
iand that is a divi-ioia of free silver
peopjl, on party lines.-Noncon
lormiuist.
('orrect, but the gold bugs have
all the money, and those whom
tiiey can't blind or buldoze, they
will :attempt to buy. to stay where
they are- divided.
It will only be necessary to keep
the free silver Republicanns in that
party. and the free sil er Dewo
crat in his, and the Populists,
though in a free silver party
can't willn.
The free silver forces will thus
he divided into three parts, and
iwill fall an easy prey to the clutch
es of Shylock.
The gold hugs paird 8A04 1,t00u0 to
have silver demonetized, and had
to steal the hill through at that
price. Since that time the wealthl
of this country created by the toil
int masses has been pouring into
the laps of the few as fast as the
rains of Winter roll toward the
ocean, and to-day, that few are
prepared to spend millions of their
ill-gotten gains to continue this
flow, and prevent its being turned
toward the people once more.
The most effectual (and by far
the least dangerous) way to fight
the enemy is to keep that enemy
divided and fighting each other.
With their unlimited boodle then,
these shylocks will begin to
strengthen party ties, already the
cry has gone up, "Save the good
old party, better let the silver ques
tion go than break up the dear old
party."
So far from supporting any one
party, the gold bugs will be sup
porting all parties--strengthening
their lines and trying to hold the
silver element intact in each res
pective party.
Indeed, this one time, we expect
to see Shylock's gold come to the
aid of our own beloved People's
party. In this way,-he will urge
every Populist to stand by his par
ty, to beware of that nonpartisan
silver movement, well knowing
that if the nonpartisan silver move
ment can be defeated, that silver
will be defeated for another four
years, when, because of still lo.wer
prices, the masses will be too poor,
too impoverished to make a new
fight.
We will never go into the Demo
cratic or Republican party to fight
for free silver or any other reform,
and we think any Populist wou!d
be a fool to do so, because there is
no kind of doubt but that the gold
bugs are in possession of the ma
chinery of both these parties, and
we believe a straddle like that of
'92, will be both their platforms,
but we are willing to meet honest
free silver men of all parties half
way to make this one, last death
struggle for free silver, and more
money. Then, if we lose, the old
parties will have joined each other
to do it, and this would put the
contest where we long have wished
it-between two armies-plutocra
cyagainst the people; but if we
win, the People's party will claim,
deserve and get the credit for the
victory, as abe now gets the credit
for the agitation.
Kentcky Democracy has gone
tothe gold bugs, but you hear the
childishpl that the gold bugs
can't do it anywhere else in the
South or West, that they won in
that State beeuse it was the home
of Clevelsad's tool, Secretary Car

iAs . 3,, :"i ,:ra I.,rr. .iait :
ntusli,: of 5,,.. ciie s in the (ad
joining parish of 'Grant, we feel
it our duty to warn our friends
there of a combination at their
county seat that is attempting to
rule the politics of the parish in
geniral, iand the People's party in
particular with an iron hand. The
a.utene-s of their dictatoxial
plans is only etqualled by the bold
ne-s with which they Inilrdle the
~King's English," and the inimbe
Icilit v of what thely choose to call
their argiiºient.
In the State election of 1Pý2. tlhe
white Populists of that parish, un
fortunately for all concerned, in
vited the colored Populists into
their primary for nominating a
parish ticket. Schemiers in both
the old parties joined with traitors
in the 'eoplel ' party. put out a
ticket. uiolt of %\ hich they fell sure
the white Populists would not sup
port, and by polling a few white
votes and a solid colored ot4,,
they nloinated iliost of their tick
iet. The party was shaken flom
center to circaulfercence. and seve
ral efftlorts were' niade to repiudiate
the ticket, but finally, with a lpat
riotism seldom equalled, the white
Populists rallied to the ticket and
elected it, with one exception, thus
beating the schemers at their own
game.
To avoid a possible repetition of
this game in the opening camipaign
nimany ans Populists in th:it i)arish
are advocating a convention, to
nominate their parish ticket, but
this new combine of young nien,
andl younger lpoliticians declare
with niuch verbosity that a coni
vention woull violate the conntitc
tion of the People's party, and
that lprimaries alone are orthodox
Populistic methods.
Having succeeded in smothering
out this demand of the l,)lple for
protection from a recurrence of
the frauds of 189 2, this fresh com
hination crowed very loudly over
their supposed victory, and with
a self-satisfied air looked them
about for "new worlds to con
quer." They had not far to look.
hut this time they turned ulxin a
creature of their own creation.
We all remember, that much
against the advice of this paper,
as well as The Comrade and Winn
parish populism, this combination,
working through the People's par
ty of Grant parish, demanded ju
dicial nominations andt called for a
preliminary convention to that ef
fect. This convention met at
Winnfield and adopted a complete
straddle on the question for which
it was called, and then proceeded
to take up State politics, request
ing State chairman Booth, to join
with others in a call for a non-par
tisaa ballot reform conference at
Alexandria, on July 4th. Com
plying with the spirit of this re
quest, Mr. Booth joined others in
calling the New Orleans mass con
vention, which announced itself so
emphatically, not only in favor of
ballot reform, but in favor of an
other plank in the Populist plat
form-free silver.
iNow, this inconsistent, I;
lovely combination is fighting
the result of the New Orleans con
vention, in which they themselves
took the initial step.,
The real motives in all this som
ersaulting and gyrating are to lind
part of the combination minto office,
and land certain other fellows, who
are not in the combination, but
who have heavy purses. To hide
these mercenary motives they cry
"fusion," "disgruntled element,"
etc., against the men who founded
the People's party and supported
it when this delectable combination
was, part of it in the Democratic
party, and part of it too young to
vote.

Going to retaliate, eh, if we
don't do just to suit you.
Our neighbor seems to iaIn,
ine that the people of Winn have
Ibecome so thoroughly iu(cu
lated with the, Senatorial mania as
to have their reason half dethroned.
If our neighbor will, while he i.
doing so much wholese llIO kicking,
submit soime practical way in which
an honest election can be held, he t
doubtless will strike the miost vital}
point of this question, and save the
people any more worry fromt this
source.
No, the people of Winn are vast
ly more interested in honest elec
tions, than they are from what
particular section the senator
should come from, so long as he is
a good Populist.-Comrade.
Hurrah, for B. W. Bailey. You
can't buy his principles with oflice.
IIe's not built that way.
For shame, Ed. Mathis, for very
shame ! That poor boy has work
ed and toiled and delved, almost
against hope, and without remu
neration, while you, demanding a
salary of $45 per month, have sap
ped his paper of more than its
profits ever since he has owned it,
and the balance he owes you on
that extortionate salary you pro
pose to hold over him as a death
knell to his paper, if you can't
drive him to your gold hug plan
by threats of defeat for an office to
which he is so justly entitled. And
munless the people for whom he is
so nobly battling come to his res
cue, you will succeed with your
nefarious scheme.
Was ever the.plan of heartless
Shylock morecruel? Such beings
have never been, are not now and
never will be populists, and are
only fit for the willing tools of a
relentless, soul-less money-power.
