G E OE THE/ ]\j E ‘ Austin
Until recently literature, as well as
politics and common life, exalted the
prosperous and noble, who were es
teemed above the masses. They prized
castles, aristocracy and the great
wealth of capitalists. High life "was
described with approval. Men as
sumed that the nobility and the other
“high” classes were elevated above
" others because of some exceptional
virtue.
But now this title to eminence is
challenged. The means of becoming
great, especially of becoming rich, are
deemed vices rather than virtues.
Those who get up in the world are
thought to do so at the expense of the
low. These last are believed to be
deprived of their rights. Eminence
is looked into. Its cause, whether
just or unjust, is examined. The
wealthy and great are assumed to be
wrongly so, while the poor are not be
lieved to have their share of what
they produce. Wealth is mostly pred
atory. The common people are com
ing forward and demanding a new
recognition in society. Fiction, poli
tics and sociology consider the wants
of the many rather than of the few;
and the question of all progress is to
give workers their dues. The many
are chiefly regarded by economists,
and our aim is to make more persons
comfortable and noble. The elevation
of the whole is sought in a democ
racy. Where this does not exist its
lack is thought to betoken some
wrong-doing.
There is now no such praise of the
higher classes as once existed. The
virtues of the poor are portrayed and
the vices of the rich. The poor are
thought better than the “higher”
classes. The man who studies life
studies the condition of the many.
Among them, rather than among the
few, human nature shows itself.
To be good now one must benefit
the many. He may not be snobbish,
or known to favor the few. Every
politician claims to be the friend of
the working man, and is lavish in his
praises of the poor. The object of
all government is to give the many
a chance. The wealth centered in the
few is to be better distributed, and
the means of distribution are sought.
We can never again have a few no
blemen living in castles with extensive
lands and many vassals. The so
ciety described by Walter Scott
which existed in the middle ages is
no longer possible. Life as lived by
the aristocracy is no better than the
simple life; the simple life is praised
and the life of the many is made the
subject of literature. The wealthy
live in plain houses, as a rule, and no
longer feel it an honor to have a ret
inue of servants. That only makes
them unpopular, whereas once it made
them “noble.” The people do not
prize great wealth and eminence, but,
as stated, regard them as wrong and
as wrung from the common people.
The millionaires can no longer ex
hibit a life of luxury. They get no
recognition of superiority by such
means. Castles, extensive lands, great
parks, and other evidences of wealth,
are supposed to be evidence of dis
honesty. Enormous wealth is synony
mous with ill-gotten gains, and its
possessors seek to hide it rather than
to flare it in the face of the people.
A leveling going on, and the
“highest” must pretend to promote
it. The wealthy defend themselves
instead of compelling the poor to do
so. They represent that they are less
wealthy than they are, and that their
wealth benefits the poor. This is the
age of the many. The working man
has entered politics and holds the
balance of power, his conditions being
vastly improved. He works little
more than he needs for recreation.
His wages are high, and the rich com
plain that workmen have most of the
profit. Many are joint owners in the
concerns for which they labor.
The poor have entered more largely
into literature. The traits of human
nature are recognized as common.
They may be found in all, so that the
poor take an honored place in fiction
and the drama. They have the no
bility, heroism and other honors; and
“high” society. Nearly all novels de
scribe common life rather than
“high” life. The nobility of the
common people is more general than
it used to be. Few take an interest
in the rich and other exceptional
classes. They are thought to repre
sent the few, and mainly the vicious
element. The common people were
once supposed to be the criminals. The
wealthy and noble are now thought
to be.
All aristocracy is conceded to be
unjust. Favors granted a class are
regarded as immoral. They are not
allowed in this country, and they
promise soon to be abolished in Eu
rope. They are already so in France,
and the people all over the continent
are beginning to inquire by what right
higher and privileged classes exist.
The public hardly recognize the dis
tinctions of family and position which
once existed in foreign countries.
None but themselves concede their
honors and eminence. Everybody can
set up to be an aristocrat with abou.
there is no longer much portrayal of
equal claims. The world goes on with
out recognizing them. Aristocracy,
like a football, is kicked and despised.
It is laughed at where it used to be
feared, and the aristocrat is begin
ning to be hated for his pretensions.
Birth and station are naturally equal,
and we would make the recognition
of this equality general.
The aim to get distinction and be
recognized as superior, is regarded as
unworthy of men. To aim to out
class one’s fellows is held a vice. It
is thought, if one is more wealthy
than another, to be contemptible to
remind him of it A or to do anything
that implies a reminder. All must be
humble, especially the great. The rich
man feels liable to lose his wealth by
parading it. He knows that the many
regard it as evidence of injustice in
him. It is claimed that no man can
be a millionaire honestly, and that
fortunes are evidences of vice. Peo
ple now seek to become great by serv
ice, working for the interests of the
whole and trying to prevent poverty.
To delight in family, wealth or posi
tion is considered base. People de
light in what they can do for others,
and their usefulness is the only road
to honor.
It formerly was necessary to have
a princess for every story. The com
mon people were not thought to de
serve an ideal place in fiction. Nearly
every fairy tale had a prince or other
3tffersonian
royal personages.- The dramas had
some noble character for the admira
tion of the public. If a common indi
vidual was the hero of a play or novel,
he was a prince in disguise, or shown
to be of high birth. The heroes and
heroines were often stolen from gyp
sies, and in their youth mistakenly
thought to be common people. Even
Shakespeare’s plays turn on the
merits of some prince or aristocrat.
The people were the rabble, unfit for
anything but comic situations. Only
in modern times have the many en
tered fiction as heroic. Princes are
not so much esteemed or needed. The
common people take their place in
literature, as in other branches of
life, and this is the age of the many,
which literature reflects, as does
every other branch.

THE WORTH OF A WORKER.
Something may be said for the con
tention that protection is needed by
the American laborer against the
strain of speeding up and the long
hours of work. As a proof of the
manner in which human flesh and
blood is being ground up in American
mills, and as proof that Blaine was
right when he said that the actual
labor-cost of American products is
less, on account of the superior effec
tiveness of American labor, than that
of the products of any other nation,
the estimate of the annual product of
the workers of different nations made
by William G. Clark in the Engineer
ing Magazine for May, 1904, is well
worthy of consideration.
According to this estimate, the
year’s output of a wage-earner is
worth in this country, $2,450 per
year. The Yankee workman’s nearest
competitor, the Canadian, produces
$1,455 per year; the Australian,
$900; the French wage-worker, $640;
the much-dreaded “pauper” worker
of the United Kingdom, $556; and
the German, $460.
As to labor it would seem that the
American trust may well hold its own
with other nations, its most active
competitors among which have to use
labor which is only from one-fifth to
a little more than one-third as effec
tive as ours. Conceding that the
American laborer gets more for the
day’s work, he is still a cheaper
workman, measured in what he does,
than any of them. —LaFollette’s
Magazine.

TOM WATSON MELON—-72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. It has every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
