Ohio Democratic Platform.
The following sound platform was
ouanimolslY adopted by the mo- oi
mrtic State Conveution of Ohli, on
the 17th iust :
The demniocratic party of Ohio, in
S ate convention assembled, proclaim i
tie fllowing propositions of political i
faith and actions:
First-A sacred adherence to the M
principles of government declared D
Sput in practical operation by the H
fathere of the republic.
Second-Opposition to agg ressions J
by etther departmuent of the govern- A
,la upon the functions of the others, N
na to the exercise by Federal author- j.
ity of any of the powers reserved by J,
the conatitntion to the States, res- Jr
peetlively, or to the people. p
Third--'he protection of the gov- S.
f-mentto all citizens, withoutr- J.
a1 to race, color or previous con- A
ditios of servitude. R.
Fourth - The President's services Ei
shotld be limited to one term, at a A
lr-r of $25,000 a year.
I'rth-Retrench ment and reform in H
every department, Federal State and J
licl. J
Sixth--No grants of land or money Ca
by the government or use of its credit V
to railroad, steamships or other com- N
psale" J.
Seventh--The preservation of the w
remnant of public lands for the ben- CG
efit of citizens of the United States J.
and foreign emigrants, who have de- J,
elated their intention to become sach, F
who will occupy and cultivate the H

Eight--That the contraction of the R
eurrency heretofore made by the re- a]
" publican party,'and the further con
traction proposed by it, with a view
to the forced resumption of specie
payment, has already brought disas- 24
ter to the business of the country, ti
and threatens it wit with general bank- tl
ruptoy and rain. We demand that p
this policy be abandoned, and that a
the volume of currency be made and C
kept equal to the wants of trade, t(
leaving the restoration of legal ten
der to par with gold, to be brought '
about by promoting the industries of
the country, and not by destroying
htem.
jiath-That the policy already in- I
diiated by the republican party of
bolisbing legal tenders and giving a
ational banks power to furnish, all F'
theenrrency, will increase the pow
drso already dangerous monopoly,
,lthe enormous burdens now up
s gsfag the people without any coin
Sttlng advantage, and that we op
eto this policy the demand that

prauptly and permanently retired,

pset fer the obligation of contracts c
renires the payment of at least one- B
Sl0fof the customs in legal tenders. p
`Eleventh-The extinction of the

WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 1875
The approach of the Presidenti:d cler
tion gives uniusual imlport-uee to the
events and developments of 1875. We
shall endeavor to describe them fully,
faithfully, and fearlessly.
TIHE WEEKLY SUN has now attain.
ed a circulation of over seventy tihou
sand copies. Its readers are found in
every State and Territory, and its quali
ty is well known to the public. We
shall iet only endeavor to keepl it fully
up tobhe old standard, but to ilprove t
and add to its variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to r
be a thorough newspaper. All the news
of the day will be found in it, condens- .
ed when unimportant, at full length a
when of monment, and always, we trust, a
treated iu a clear, interesting and in- F
structive manner.
It is our aim to make the Weekly Sun
the best family newspaper in the world. t
It will lie full of entertaining ap-nd a
propriate reading of every sort, but will
print nothing to offend the most scruu
lons and delicate taste. It will always
contain the most interesting stories and r
romances of the day, carefully selected t
and legibly printed. r
The Agricultural Department is a c
prominent feature in the Weekly Sun, t
and its articles will always be fiund ,
fresh and useful to the farmer.
The number of men independent in a
poiitics is increasing, and the Weekly ,
Sun is their paper especially. It belongs r
to no party, and obeys no dictation, con- r
tendiung for principle, and for the election
of the best men. It exposes the corrup- c
tion that disgraces the country and t
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no fear of knaves, I
and seeks no favors from their support
ers.
The markets of every kind and the f
fashions are regularly reported ini its
columns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
and fifty-six columns. As this barely
pays expenses of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al- 1
low any premium to friends Who may
make special efforts to extend its circula- I
tion. Under the new law, which re
quires payment of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty cents the
cost of prepaid postate added, is the rate
of subscription. It is not necessary to
get up a club in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate. Any one who sends
one dollar and twenty cents will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.-Eight pages,
fifty-six coluflins. Only $1.10 a year,
1mstage prepaid. No discount from this
rule.
THE DAILY SUN.-A large four-page
newspaper of twenty-eight columns
Daily circulation over 120000. All the
news for 2 cents. Subscription, postsge
prepaid 55 cents a month, or $650 a year.
To clnbs of 10 or over, a discount of 20
per cent. Address.

THE
Pcople'sV indicator,
FOR 1875.
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOR,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the continuation of its publication upon
a firm basis. The public are well aware
of the difficilties under which the Con
servative press ot Louisiana labor; the
infamous printing law passed by a parti
san Legislature, solely to foster and up
hold, at the expense of the tax-payers,
journals entirely antagonistieal to their
intereet, and at war upon their libnrties,
and by forcing, under the forms of law,
our citizens to advertise in these official
papers, to break down their pwemr, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
sequently we are compelled to depend
for snpport 1upn the generons contribu
tion of a people already poverty-stricken,
but wefeel assured that they wll not
fail to sustain their main power in the
war o yi.tue against vice
li'he '?earl|s White Isa's Fres of
Loals.ian
The future tone of this paper can be
judged hfom its pasit, We wil continue
toadvocate to eaccess, the rights of the
TAXED, that honesty and capabilit,
ALONE, shalt constitute gronods for po
litical preferment, and,  eontinned and
never ceae~ng war upon Kellogg and his
coaupt pfeclals-ltn wing them to be in

" We can assureIhe public that we will

A ROlPrflstativo and Champton of American
Art Taste!
Frospccnils for 1875--Eighthl Ter.
THE ART JOURNAL OF AMERICA,
1sSUED MIONTHL. A
"A Magnificent Conception, wonderfully
carried out."
The necessity of a popular mediunm for r
the representation of the productions of
our great artists, has always been recog.
nized, and many attempts have been
made to meet the want. The successive
failures which so inv'ribly followed eah W
attempt in this country to establish an
art journal, did not prove the indififer
ence of the people. pf America to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper !
appreciation of the want and an abihty io
to meet it were shown, the public at N
once rallied with enthusiasnl to its sup- hay
port, and the result was a ageat artistic loll
and commercial trinmph--TlIE ALDINE.
THE ALDINE, while issued with all the
regularity, has none of the temporary or
timely interest characteristic of ordinary
perindicals. It is an elegant nmiscellany
of pure, light and graceful literature'; and
a collection of pictures, the rarest speci- col
iens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding inmlber aflords on
a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real do
value and Ibeauty of the ALDINE will ie
most appreciated after it has been bound
up at the chlose of the year. While other
journals may claim superior cheapness, as -
compared with ri rals of a similar class,
the ALLN'E is a unique and original con
ception-alone and unapproached - abso
Intely without competition in price or
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplicate the quantity of
fine paper and engravings in any other
shape or number of volumes for toen times
its cost * and then, there is the Chromo Co
besides ar
National feature' of THE ALDINE De
must be taken in no narrow sense. True tui
art is cosmopolitan. While THE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not confine itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its mission In
is to cultivate a broad and appreciative ne
art taste, one that will discriminate only ar
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the patrons of THE n
ALDINE. as a leading chancteritic, the ne
productions of the most noted American
artists, attention will ilwuays b1e )even to tO
specimens front foreign nlasters, giving Wi
subscribers all the pleasure and instruc- ie
tion obtainable from home or foreign to
sources.
The artistic illnutration of American
scenery, original with THE ALDINE, is P
an impoftant feature, and its magnificent -
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
than can be'afforded by any inferior V
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal A
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. The literatnre of THE
ALDINE is a light and gracefll accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only such technical disqrisi
tions as do not interfere with the popn
lar interest of the work.
Premium for 1875.
Every subscriber for 1875 will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
same noble dog whose picture in a for
mer issue attraeted so much attention, in
"AfAN'S UNSELFISH FRIENID"
I will be a welcome in every home. Eve
rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait i
is executed so true to the life, that it a
seems the veritable presence of the ani- as
mat itself. The Rev. T. De Witt Tal- e'
mage tells that his own Newfoundland
dog (the finest in Brooklyn, barks at it! f,
Although so natural, no one who sees at
this premium chromo will have tlhe )
slighteet fear of being bitten.
Besides the chromno, every advance
subscriber to THE ALDINE for 1875 is C
constituted a member, and entitled to
all the privileges of
