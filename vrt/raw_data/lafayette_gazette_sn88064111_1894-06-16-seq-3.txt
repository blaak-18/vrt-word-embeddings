The Public School Exhibition.
The lateness of the hour and the
lack of space prevent The Gazette
from doing simple justice to Prof.
Greig, the capable assistant, Miss
Jamieson,and their bright and well
trained pupils for the splendid ex
hibition given at Falk's Opera
House Thursday night. The house
was crowded and if we may judge
by the deafening applause and the
manywords of praise there was not a
single person in the andience who
was not exceedingly pleased with
theentertainment. The production
of 'Columbia or America's Cantata"
was admirable, the thirteen boys,
with their gorgeous costumes em
blematic of the different countries,
presented a magnificent scene. The
ancient and modern military and
the little Yankee Doodles scored a
decided hit. The National song,
<'Columbia the Gem of the Ocean."
was well rendered, and the tableau,
",Liberty Enlightening the Worldl"
was very pretty. In fact the pro
gram from beginning to end wvs in
teresting and instructive. It was
selected to please old and young
and all those present know how
well it succeeded. The gross receii.ts

LAFAYETTE HIGHl SClOOL
Closing Exercises at Falk's Hall,
Friday, Juite 8 and 9.
Oil Friday and Saturday nights, June 8
and 9 the High School held its first conm
mencenlitt exercises. Thi.4 school was
opened for the first time on Jan. 22, 1894,
in the handsonme, new, and cotnmmodious
building which had just been completed.
Prof. W. A. l.eRosen was placed in charge,
anid under his able management the school
has just closedc a moast successful session.
The proficiency of the pupils and the credit
able manner in which each and all acquitted
themselves is a souree of great satisfaction to
all.
The programs,both nights were varied and
entertaining and proved a gratifying surprise
to all. No one, it is safe to say, expected
such an excellent entertainment, and all
evidenced their pleasure by repeated ap
plause. A number of the selections were
encored. It would afford The Gaz-tte plea
sure to mention each and all deserving
special mention; but when so many deserve
it, space forbids.
The two entertainments were given for the
purpose of purchasing a cistern, and we an
nounce with pleasure that $51 was cleared.

manner in which the scholars played their
parts, the perfect system with which the

been the efforts of the painstaking teacher.

ACotton Seed Oil Mill.
Mr. J. C. Burrass, of Carrolton,
Ill., was in Lafayette this week look
ing over the country in the hope of
selling some machinery should there
be any move here to build a cotton
seed oil mill. Mr. Burrass said
that he was much surprised to see
that there was no mill of this kind
in operation here as he thought that
this place offered better advantages
than any other in the State. Should
any of our citizens desire any infor
mation as to the cost of a mill and
the profits of the business, Mr. BuIr
rass will answer all letters alddressed
to him at Carrollton, Ill, He has'
much experience in the cotton seed
oil business, having managed several
mills, anong which is the
ronle nea1('r S1hrCr'port for f.lr et',-:
Sli ays that iln .nuu'h 1s,; t(m,'vture1
sections than this, oil miills have
yielded large profits with rarely any
failures. When it is learnt that
$ao,ooo would buildd a good size
- millit is indeed a surprise that some
of our local capitalists bayv not
already invested their money in such
an enterprise. The mills in New
Iberia, St. Martinville, Alexandria,
Shreveport and bther towns, are all,
we believe in a prosperous condition.
The yearly shipment of cotton seed
from this point amount to something
like 4000 tons, enough to keep a
mill of ordinary size in operation
one year.
Pritneaux Balled.
Judge Allen has bailed Adam
Primeaux, who was accused of rape,
in the su-a of $700. From the re
port of Drs. Trahan and Gladu,
who were appointed as experts in
the case, it appears that the crime
charged was not committed and in
consequence Primeaux was allowed
to furnish bond. A. M. Martin is
his bondsman.

Two Lives Saved.
Mrs. Phoebe Thomas, of Junction City, Ill.
was told by her doctors she had Consumptionti
hnd that there was no hope for her, but two
bottlcs I r. King's New Discovery completely
cured her and she says it saved her life. Mr.
Ths.,. Eggers, i39 Fl rida St. San Francisco,
suffered fromn a dreadful cold, approaching
Coinsumptnlion tried without result everything
else then bought one bottle of Dr. kling's
Nevw Discovery andl in two weeks was curetd.
lie is naturally thankful. It is such results,
of which these are s.amples, that prove the
wonderful cliicacy of this medicine in Coughs 1
and Colds. Free trial bottles at Wm. Clegg's
Drug Store. Regular size 5o0. and $Sx.o.
Another Warning.
In another column, a correspon
dent, who signs himself, "A Con
stant Reader," makes a very wise
suggestion. He suggests that the
people give a fair to raise fonds
to procure fire protection for the
town. In the last two weeks two
fires have occurred in the town, but
fortunately there was no wind to fan
the flames and spread the sparks
and the only buidings destroyed
were those where the fires originated.
As our correspondent truthfully says
the fire WVednesday night is a second
warning within the past few days.
Will the people profit by it? 'W'ill
they remain inactive and wait till it
will be too late ? We dare say that
there is not a town in the State so
completely at the mercy of fires as
our own. Just think of a place with
a population of over 3500 people
without even a hand pump. Towns
with one-fourth the population of
Lafayette have well organized fire
companies with pumps, hooks andt
ladders, etc. Should there be a fire
in this town during a strong wind
there is no telling what will be the
result. The whole place is liable
to be swept out by the flames and
then it will be too late to talk about
fire protectien. The time is ripe
now. Let some one make the ini
tiative step and he will be seconded
by every body. Strike the iron
while it is hot.
Fond of Chickens.
Thursday morning the attention
of several railroad boys was called
to the house formerly used as a tem
pie of justice by ex-judge Israel
Falk, of New Orleans, and upon
Investigation it was discovered that
two young chicken thieves had taken
p~ossession of the once august court
toont and had converted it into a
dop~ository of their booty. The
yomung negroes were comfortably
seatcd around a fire which they had
matde in an old cooking stove. A
hen and a half dozen spring chickerns
were found near by. The negroes
claimed St. landry as their horne
I and said that they had comenc in
Stiwn to. sell the chickens, but as this
Lr, ua.l i h ,y ccii . luct, : ! to ,Ž-s,>ir'I II.t:.is
to the depot and report the case 'o
the police, but before this place
was reached the prisoners made a
break for liberty. A hot chase e- -
suted, but the negroes were the be.t
runners and made good their escape.
Prof. LeRosen.
Prof LIeRosen left yesterday for
Shieveport where he will spend va
cation. The professor will take a
well-eatned rest after six months of
tedious teaching. The patrons of
the High School throughout the
parish will be pleased to learn that
he will return to Lafayette at the
end of the vacation months to con
tinue in charge of the School.
Although he has been with us only
a few months he has fully demons
trated his ability as a teacher. He
is a zealous worker in the cause of
public education and it is indeed a
fortunate thing that the first high
school established in Lafayette par
ish was put in charge of such com
petent hands. During his short
stay in our town he has a made a
large ,number of staunch friends who
join The Gazette in wishing him a
very pleasant viacation.
Marriage Bells.
(Communicated.)
E'er the ink upon this paper shall assume
a well dried appearance the marriage bells
will sound and chronicle the joyful intelli
gence of the happy union of Mr. W. Ii.
Parrot, of this place, to Miss Cora Stagg, of
\Vhiteville, St. Landry parish. The happy
event will take place at the residence of the
bride's mother to-day at 9:30 a. m. and the
newly made couple will arrive on No. 51
to leave on No. 20 at 3:30 for El Paso, Tex.

ful, noble Bill will have deserted the rank
and tile and joined the fortunate band of
lienedicks, and enshrine himself 'mid hy
meneal bowers sipping sweet ambrosia
from the roseate branches and drinking the
nectar that Jupiter sips. But while we de
plore the sad condition of our broken
ranks, we can but wish friend Bill a happy
and joyous voyage upon the stormy ocean
of life. May yours be all sunshine with not
a single cloud to darken and obscure your
happy life. 1May gay flowers ever be strewn
in your pathway, and bright stars ever bea
con to abiding love, constaticy and pro
tection of the beautiful rose snatchled from
St. Landry's fairest filowcrs to nestle on thy
busomu. s
Mr. and Mrs. Winm. Kelly and

Cadet James Alfred Moss, from

United States Millitary Academy at
West Point, N. Y., to-day. Cadet
Moss is the youngest son of Judge

ceived his preiiminary education at
home and at Baton Rouge. At the
time he received his appointment to
Wvest Point in a 89o he was a student
at the Louisiana Agricultural and
Mechanical University. He was
appointed by Hon. Andrew Price,
on his merits, resulting from a com
petitive examination in which a
number of aspirants from the Third
Congressional, District participated.
Cadet Moss has many friends in
Lafayette, of which place he is a
native, and with whom he has
always been a favorite, who are
feeling much gratified at his deserved
success and who will watch with
just pride and interest his future
career. He will shortly visit his
home on furlough. Cadet Pegrani
Whitworth, of Louisiana, will also
graduate from W\'est Point to-da).
Times-Democrat.
Pianic at Point-ds-Mloutons.
Quite an enjovable picnic was
given by Prof Chas. A. Bondreaux
at Pont des Mouton to his pupils on
last Thursday. A great number of the
patrons and friends of the school
were present and lent their assistance
toward making the picnic a decided
success. Somewhere between 200
and 250 people were present, andt
everybody seemed to have a good
time. During the morning the
puIils of Prof Boudreaux entertained
the audience with songs, recitations,
and dialogues, and all acquitted
themselves with much credit. It was
quite an addition to the pleasure of
the picnic.
About two p. m. the baskets were
opened and the good things for
which Prof. Boudreautx's picnics are
famous were there in great abun
dance. Everybody enjoyed a good
dlinner. But just as the last were
finishing a heavy rain fell and those
who were not fortunate enough to
find a buggy or hack, or reach the
pump shed, enjoyed a wetting.
BIut it is said that a picnic without
rain is no picnic at all. At any rate,
the boys and girs made enough fund
out of the shower to recompelnse
them for the dtiscomtforts.
Owing to the dampness, the lpic
nickers soon began leaving; but all
expressed themcsclvcs as having ha'l
