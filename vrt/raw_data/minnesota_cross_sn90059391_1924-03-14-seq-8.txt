that his department had reported
to Secretary Mellon there hau been
no fraudulent issue of bonds from
the bureau of engraving and print

So much for the William J. Burns

bonds and these members of congress
have had these bonds in their hands
and examined same.
Stand Rack of Bureau
Of course Mr. Burns and his de
partment are going to stand by the
men in the bureau of engraving and
printing who got away with putting
the Pope’s head on new dollar bills
and others put out millions of dol
lars worth or duplicate liberty bonds.
The house committee on rules has
heard the treasury department and
its officials blamed for having sup
pressed the truth in regard to these
duplicate bonds produced at the bur
eau of engraving and printing. Sup
porting Mr. Brewer’s charges of dup
licated bonds Congressman King, of
Illinois, read to the committee a
lengthy statement, substantiating
Brewer’s case, and reading into The
Record letters from President Hard
ing which he said showed a confi
dence of the late chief executive in
this man Brewer.
Many Destroyed
This is an odd case. Something
about it isn’t right. The treasury
department has caused to be destroy
ed untold number of these duplicate
bonds, hence just that much evidence
is done away with. The department
of justice has tried in every way to
fire this man Brewer for his work,
yet President Harding told him to
go ahead and pay no heed to orders
from any one except the president.
President Coolidge has told him
practically the same thing. Here we
have two departments of the govern
ment at loggerheads with the presi
dent.
There is something rotten in this
whole case and it ought to come out
no matter who it hits or hurts. It is
just as important to investigate that,
as it was to uncover the oil frauds,
bribery charges and other corrup
tion. If we have corruption and ir
regularities in the treasury depart
ment, the bureau of engraving and
printing and the department of jus
tice, let there be a good and thor
ough housecleaning all along the
line and let’s do it right and not half
way.
Klanswomen Aid Church
Clear $5,000 Mortgage
ST. PAUL. KAN.. March 10.—Hear
ing the call of patriotism, many lo
cal units of the Women of the Ku
Klux Klan in Kansas have made do
nations to the local Methodist church,
the only Protestant church in this
community, to assist it in retiring
half of a $5,000 mortgage, which is
due. The community is strongly
Catholic, and a few weeks ago
the owner of he mortgage an
nounced his intention of making a
garage out of the church if the mort
gage was unpaid. However, the vari
ous Klan and Women’s organizations
have made many substantial contri
butions to the cause. Announcement
of gifts to the church by women at
Peabody, Natoma and Madison was
made this week.

Thousands of robed Klansmen at

to the Cardinal Gibbons Institute, a
Catholic school for colored boys, to

COOLIDGE WINS
74 DELEGATES
TO CONVENTION
(Rurenu of Publication and Kduratlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C., March 6.-
Speaking of politics, it might be well
to look at the situation as it appears
right now. especially on the Republi
can side of the fence. Up to date 74
delegates to the Republican national
convention have been chosen and
President Coolidge has bagged them
all. The list as it now stands is:
lowa. 29; Virginia. 15; Kentucky, 26;
South Carolina. 4 at large.
In the above list the state of lowa
was the last one to choose its dele
gation, and William M. Butler, man
ager of the Coolidge campaign, says
they are for Coolidge, “first, last and
all the time.” Practically al Ithe
delegates to the national conventions
of both the Republican and Demo
cratic parties will be selected in the
next 10 weeks, and the fight is on
right now to capture these delegates
for bthe different candidates in both
parties.
Other Primaries Soon
On March 11 the presidential pri
mary will be held in the state of
New Hampshire. North Dakota will
follow with a primary on March 18:
then South Dakota comes along on
March 25. The primaries dated for
April are as follows: Wisconsin, April
1; Michigan, April 7; Illinois, April
8; Nebraska, April 15; New Jersey.
April 22; Oregon, April 28; Ohio,
April 29.
Republican delegates to the nation
al convention will be chosen by the
state convention method during the
month of March. Also, the test of
strength between President Coolidge
and' Senator Hiram Johnson in the
big wheat states of the northwest are
scheduled for this month.
Senator La Follette, of Wisconsin,
has practically taken himself out of
the presidential race for the Republi
can nomination, and this narrows the
Republican field to a contest be
tween the president and Senator
Johnson.
Butler’s Prediction
William F. Butler, manager for
Coolidge, said recently that reports
coming to him from all parts of the
United States convinced him that
President Coolidge will get at least
900 out of the 1,109 delegates who
will sit in the Cleveland convention.

ISSUE OF KLAN
Congregation Did Not Wish
To Hear Truth of Great
American Order
TELLS HIS ATTITUDE
Rt*v. C. Eldon Stuck Said to Be
Open Advocate of the
Organization
(Special Correspondence)
GAYVILLE, S. D., March B.—Rev.
C. Eldon Stuck, pastor of the Metho
dist Episcopal church at Volin near
here, last Sunday resigned his pas
torate, when his congregation refus
ed to hear his sermon entitled, “Who,
What and Why the Klan?”
Saturday evening, March 1, Rev.
Mr. Stuck was informed by the offi
cial board of the Volin church that
they would rather have him change
the subject of his sermon for Sunday
evening. This he refused to do. The
evening service at the Violin church
was then called off.
Special Session
Resting
Sunday afternoon a special session
of the board was called, and was ad
dressed by Rev. Mr. Stuck. He de
clared that he did not desire to
serve a congregation which was not
williag to listen to the truth about a
great Protestant movement like the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He
thereupon tendered his resignation
as pastor of the Volin charge which
he held jointly with the church at
Gayville.
Rev. Mr. Stuck has served the Vo
lin church for the past year and has
all that time been a champion of the
cause of the Klan. He has from
time to time made talks on the or
ganization before the members of
his congregation. He has urged the
people of South Dakota to affiliate
with the order which stood for real
Americanism and militant Protes
tantism.

why a church congregation should

he added.
In a letter to The lowa Fiery Cross,,
in which Rev. Mr. Stuck discussed
the situation in Violin, he wrote:
“The paper that will come out and
speak tne truth is the one thing that
we need mightily in every town, vil
lage and hamlet and until that time
comes we are dependent upon page*
like yours, to keep the uninitiated
informed. Keep up the good work
and I am sure that the time will
come when truth and right will trk

in our search for truth.”
Cincinnati Church

CINCINNATI, IA., March 10.- Re
vival services are being conducted
this week at the Christian church
with Evangelist Earle of Des Moines
in charge. The services are getting
fully under way this week, last week
having been devoted to preparatory
work. Other churches of Cincinnati

meetings a success. A junior chorus
Saturday night occupied the platform
and gave some of the inspiring old
hymns in an inspiring f.imion. The
services will continue indefinitely.
Mr. Earle has just returned to lowa
