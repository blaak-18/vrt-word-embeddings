all I can see and hear, "comitn and a'

we are now busy raisin tnb a geitei'ation
of iunts and weaklins. What seems to
be .the matter? Too durned ,ihfeinal
tOaiay tns and uities-too blamnt many
people that would rather live in a city
and wear storebought clothes and eat
dry bread and drink sorry water, than
Jlive in the country and wear plain
clothes and drink spring water and eat,
three square meals a day.
**The Malaegt Thblna is tandeCesU5i'at
Now as for me; I sint one of the sort
to be farever and eternally cumsin and
llekn agin'the towns. and cities. It is
perfectly all'right for people to-live in
town if it suits them and they can stand
it. But I have, been bruisin in this
ild rthrboth exesopen long enouigh
to nfid otu Itih s moilstrous tellin
land{ ihin4 t the boys and girls--but
the boys in particlar. In his gro'win
season, whilst the sap is runnfii u , a
boy needs plenty of itandroomance.
The iainest thing with a boy born to
freedoti and to fame is handroomance.
lie needs room enough to run and jump
and grow and spread out. Every time
I go to the city and see the droves of
pale and sickly lookin weak-eyed,
hatchetfaced, humpshouldered hollow
chested boys-honest to God it gives im e
the heartache to look at them, and 1
wonder in mny soul how long American
manhood can hold up and stand the
pace.
Sometimes I hear people may that city
folks don't raise many children, biat I
see plenty of them thete every time i
go, and I reckon the city people will
have to own Ut to most of them. By
gollya, I couldn t blame them miuch for
denyin some children I have seen around
the city. they are so terrible little and
pale and plny and sorry lookin. And
[ don't blame city people for not raisin
any more children than they do. I
wouldn't want more than six or seven
around my house if I couldn't make
pome improvements on the breed as I
have seen them around town.
Every now and occasionally you will
see some youngster that was born and
bred and brung up in. the couitry-
sound as a bran new dollar and ats
tough as the butt cut from a hickory
tree-With plenty of speed and stayin
powers, go off to the city and git into
business and buckle down to his knit
tin and presently climb up and run over
the boys that was trained up Where and
>ught to know all the ropes by heart.
It aint that one boy is any better than.
another, cause they are all more or less
bad providin they are healthy. Itis
mostly on account of the difference in
the common circumference of the gen
oral sktk'roundius under which they
have come up from boyhood to man
hood.
The city boy has been "readin,"
whilst the country boy was only sorter
"fotched up." "hce city boy may have
as much sense as the country boy if not
more. but in the toil and strife and
trials and struggles of this vain and
feetin world a sm rt head don't count
Ior much without a healthy boy to hold
It up and tote it through. Speed is a
mighty good thing for a man to have in
the race of life, but it aint worth a
fiddler's durn without some stickin
lualities and stayin powers.
The Best Place For Boys.
The best place under, the sun and in
this wide world to iaise boys and grow
men is way out in the country--back
in the -oods. That is where the
world got such men as Dan'l Webster
and Henry Clay and Abe Lincoln and
John C. Calhoun and old Hickory Jack
son. I have always held to that gen
eral doctrine, and durin the past sum
mer I had a chance to maintain my
faith with my works.
Two or three years ago John Buck
Galloway gotsick and tired of the plain
country livin around in the Rocky Creek
settlement and give it out that he was
goin to take his folks and move his
washin off to the city. So as nothin
else would do he sold out and picked up
and went. His good wife give in her
opinions right square agin the move
ment. sayin how she had always heard
tell that the city must be the last place
on top side of the earth for poor folks.
But John Buck had his mind made up
and his head sot. so there they went.
Now it had so come to pass that the
Galloways had five children at their
house two girls and three hoy.-and
little Speck, as they called him was the
baby of the brood. His right and prop
er 'name was jest plain William, but
they always called him Speck for short,
and he naturally took that pecurious
na me on account of his terrible freckly
face. Speck was jest naturally little
and ugly to start with, but of course he
didn't mean no harm by that. In his
general color and the way in which he
was complected he made a tolerable
good cross between a clay bank and a
fresh turkey egg. lBut at the same time
he w-as plum sound in mind and bod.-,
and was born with plenty of materials
in him for the makin of a man.
To be certainly of course it was none
of my business, but I stuck my finger
in the dish anyhow and told John Buck
ile was doin the wrong thing to take
his little folks to the city unless he had
plenty of money and could give them
plenty of room. which the same I know
ed he didn't have and couldn't do.
"The most brightest and promisin card
In the hand you hold is little Speck,"
says I to John Bluck. "bhut he aint got
no more business livin in a city than I
would with a full set of wvings and a
pair of. golden slippers on right now.
You take a boyas young and bright
and naturally full of life and devilment
as he is, and put him down in the city
with all of its wild and wicked ways,
and you needn't to look for nothin else
but for him to gallop with the gang as
soon as ae can and as long as he can
stand it. About the next thing you
know he will be cussin and drinkin
whisk" and lyin and stealin, and after
that it won't be no ways surprisin to
me if you catch him smoklin cgareats.
And he is too little and weekly
In the flesh to hold up at that
gait. The other boys, bein as they

John luck would raise a rncus 'whey he
got "home burt it he didn't like it ho
would have to lnip it. I could raisd
twentty boys down here in the woods
and hills more easier and better than
John Buck Galloway could raise three
in that little crowded campin place
where he lives. If I was to takeas right
young colt and pen him up clost in a
stall, and feed him day in and day out
on corn and fodder, and never let him
make a track out in the open paster,
people would set me down right away
as a natural born blame fool. But that
is about the way in which John Budit
Galloway is tryin to raise his boys.
Inside of three days after I got home
with Spack he Was contsiderable on the
thfeud. I had to keep the cheek rein up
for tbutit w wveek, thb gradutally by
degrees I give all the slac ii the rib
lions till finally at last I let him slip the
bridle and go.
"There is plenty of pranein room
around here Speck," says I, "and if you
will but only fall in with the rest of the
boys they will soon learn you the lay
of the bind. They can tell you wheth
er the fS-h will bite or riot, and where
the bait is tmost plentiful. They can
flid tine best hickory in the woods for
makin whips and whistles, and tlby
can take you to the best wash hole in
the creek. They have got to turn off a
whole passle of odd jobs. around the
place-chop pi wood and fetchin waterz
anrid feedin the stock and drivin up the
cows and ropin off the calves. and so
forth and so on-but yet still they will
find plenty of time and plenty of hand
roomance for fun and frolicin."
A little later along in the summer I
rounded up a yoke of little slab-sided,
razor-back steers for the boys and built
them a truck wagin. After two or
three runaway scrapes they got the
steers broke into the reglar service and
hauled up cook wood enough to last till
Christmas. Speck was powerful neat
and nice with his ,lothes when he first
come down from the city. but it want
long before he got bravely over that.
I think he is fully recovered by now.
IIe can git as ragged and dirty and hot
and tired and hongry as any of the boys
now, and he has also got as many dif
ferent sorts of patches on the gable end
of his 'breeches as iany of the rest. I
didn't give him any further trouble and
worriment with school books and med
icine, and for three or four months he.
has been runnin foot-loose and free and
wild as a buck. But he comes up at
meal time reglar as pig tracks three
times a day, and he comes like any
yearlin boy ought to come-healthy
and hongry and happy.
Give The Boys Growin Room.
The onlvest way to take a boy and
make a full grown man out of him is to
give him plenty of growin room, and
het him hold his head up and feel like
he is somebody. You recollect all about
James Sanders Scroggins. which the
same we called him Jimmy for short.
You remember no doubts how Jimmy
come along, a stray colt as it were. and
sorter took ap at our house and stayed
there till he got to be a grown up man.
Well now when that boy turned up at
our house lie had been browbeat and
bulldozed aud run over till he was the
worst hacked youngster I ever saw.
iBut I took him and give him a boy's
chance and he was soon holdin his head
as high and proud as any chap in the
settlement. About that time, along in
the fall of the year. I had started him
to school down at the Cross Roads
schoolhouse to a man by the name of
Solomon. One Friday evenin Jimmy
come home lookin powerful droopy and
down in the mouth. lie didn't eat
nothin to speak of Saturday and Sun
day. Monday mornin come. and still
Jimmy didn't have no appetite to eat.
At last he up and told me what wasthe
matter. He had went and got into a
tight with another boy and old man
Solomon had give it out that he was
geoin to give thetm both a good lickin on
Monday. So I lit out right soon after
breakfast and role over to Mr. Solo
mon's house to find out the facts in the
case. He didn't know nothin about it
except that .limmny and the other boy
had got into a tight and he had told
them that he was goin to whip them
Monday. Nobody didn't see the fight
and he' didn't know which one was in
wrong. but they had got into a fight.
which the same was agin the rules of
school and he was necessarily compelled
to give them a good lickin.
"Mlihter Solomon," says I, "thutaln't
no way to treat a white and freeborn
American boy. You don't so much as
know which one of them was in the
wrong. It maybe that Jiinmy had to
fight or run, and it maybe that the oth
er boy had to run or fight. The chan
ces are that you will whip a boy for no
better reason than that he want a nat
ural born coward. I don't like that,
Mr. Solomon-I don't like it even a lit
tie bit-and what is more, I don't want
any of it. That boy Jimmy is an or
phant, but I have started in to make a
man out of him and you musn'tbnust
into my plans. HIe says his ma is deed,
and he never did have no pa as anybody
knows of, but he is a thoroughbred boy,
with all of the necessary materials in
him to make a man. and by gfatlins he
must have a boy's chances in the race.
You find out whieh boy is in the wrong.
If the blame falls on Jimmy and yon
don't see no way to wortry ailong with

house to put it on iim. I woumn't let

-Veronese loved to represent festive

--Nuley Hassan, the late sultan of
Morocco, was the possessor of a fine
physique, and led a hardr, active life.
He had a lofty and rather protruding
forehead, differing in this particular
from most of his compatriots, clean

etrating eye: but his under lip was
heavy and sensual, as is usually the
case among the Shereeflan descendants
of Mahomet.
-The sultan of Turkey has little of
the old Turkish reserve about him. lie
recently invited a party of English la

He afterward asked them to dinner,
which was served in western fashion,
and both the sultan and the young
princes were quite entertaining in
conversation.
