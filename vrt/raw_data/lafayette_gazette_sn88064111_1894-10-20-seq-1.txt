NOSTALGIA.
IM tired of the town; I want
The silence of the fields;.
I'm thirsting for the peace and rent
The quiet meadow yields Ire
I want the little breeze to blow
Across my tired faoe: d
I long to shut my eyes and feel 'I
The beauty of the placa.
I want to hear the busy hum ti
Our little kinsfolk make;
I want to smell the damp moist, earth t:
That feeds the fern and brake.
I want, so much. I only want
The Lethe summer brings;
To hear the bluebird's liquid note
And see his flashing wings,
To lie upon the kind brown earth.
And hear the sweet brown thrush
Calling the trooping daisies up
Through all the grassy hush.
"
I want my little brothers' songs
To set my soul in tune:
I want forgetfulness of all
But birds, and leaves, and June.
I want no joys of life and love.
No touch of human hands;
I long to lie on nature's breast,
And feel she understands.

HE night was
without fog, r
but pitchi
dark. The up-t
a per sky was i
C full of clouds,
and through i
a the clear darkness the lights of pass- c
ing vessels were visible for miles.
There was no wind; the waters of the
wide lake were silent, curving away t
from the bow of the vessel in long, i
smooth waves, the film of crisp foam E
on their crests shining now and then t
as it caught the ship's light. I
It was the captain's watch. Bundled
against the chill of the night, a few I
passengers sat about him, murmuring 4
detached sentences among themselves,
for the captain on this deck was auto- i
e crat, and the word just now was 4
k silence.
s. But soon in the east a light wind
sprang up; the clouds rolled cumbrous- I
ly. and between them the harvest 1
moon shone suddenly, blood-red, paint
ing a lurid streak ptraight through
the black water to the ship.
V With the light, silence fled; the
shapeless forms became animated, the
waves against the bow took on a cheer
-. note, and the captain amicably ac
cepted a cigar. But behind from the
window of the pilothouse, the un
* changed face of the man at the wheel
stared out to sea.
"There surely is no danger to a boat
on such a night as this?" ventured the
captain's favorite, who was curious as
to the cause of the tension from which
we had all so suddenly been re.
lieved; and as we were talking of nerve
C in emergencies, the question seemed
not too bold.
"Starboard. Charlie, starboard!" sud
denly boomed the captain's deep voice
to the man at the wheel, with an in
tonation at once familiar and sternly
professional.
"I never had but one piece of bad
luck, and that was eight years ago"
he had resumed his conversational at
titude-"and it might jus' as well hap
pen this minute.
"I was sailin' the Davidson then,
carrying coal up and iron down the
lake. She was a pretty big barge, an'
I had my savings in her.
"Me an' my wife was sitting on the
a bow one night; my girls had gone to
bed-they'd been skylarkin' all even
ing. It was fearful black, but there
was no fog, an' you could see a light
miles off-.
"Starboard! what you got a head for?
Starboard! I said."
"Starboard," repeated the dull voice
'. of the man at the wheel, and the
' huge bulk of a vessel cleft the path
s of silver ard drifted past us in the
gloom.
S "I hadn't no more thought of an ac
cident than you have this minute,"
a went on the captain, with a nervous
catch in his voice. "Away off to star
board was the lights of a vessel. I
could see as well as I see you. Pretty
soon he whistled twice. That meant
he was a' goin' to keeptohis side. Then
I whistled twice, meanin' keep to his
side. Me an' my wife was awatchin'
him. All at once my wife said, 'Tom,
she's comin' for us.'
"Port a little, Charlie."
"Port, sir," said the man at the
Swheel.
"By George, 1 see her lights turn, an'
in a minute she was on us, straight
amidships, two-thirds through us.
S "I yelled for 'em not to back out of
Sthe hole. We'd have sunk before you
could wink if she had.
"Steady."
"Steady, sir!" said the man at the
wheel.
S "I run into my cabin for a life-pre
i. server, and clapped it on my wife. She

2 'Fanny,' I says, 'be a woman! The
Sgirls is dead, an' we'll be too in a min

that, an' I took hold of her an' climbed
up to the roof of my pilot house-their
bow was right against my mast. I
sings out for a line. There was no
time td lose, an' they throwed it quick.
I fiastened it about me an' her, an'
they hauled us up on their deck.

deck, I heard my steward hollerin's
•'le.e they are, all safe, sir!'
C "He was a good one, that fellow,"
the captain went on, after a- pause.
"'As soon as we was struck he run for
the girls an' got 'em out, an' the three
just crawled flat on the deck through
the steam."
"And was no one lost?" asked the fa.
vorite passenger.
"Steady, Charlie!"
"Steady, sir," said the man at the
wheel. '
"Three, ma'am, three," the captain 1
hummed in his deep voice. "Thal
same steward-it makes me laugh
now to think how that man hollered-
yea see, when I. knew the girls was I
safe, thinks I, I've got time to get my
books. So I run to my cabin an' got
'em out just in time. But the steward,
him an' a passenger an' the mate, they
started to save that poor feller that
was hollerin' in the boiler room. The
passenger an' the mate, they went
down, an' they'd got the man on the
passenger's shoulders, an' the steward
was lyin' flat on deck ready to take
hold of him when they got that far.
But all of a sudden the passenger hol
lered: 'Look out for yourselves!' an'
throwed the man off his shoulders, an'
our ship went down like a log. It
warn't more than five minutes, all
told, after we'd been struck."
"But that was four drowned," said
the passenger.
"I was climbing up the Delia like
mad when I heard that steward a-yell
in': 'Cap'n!' an' instead of bein' safe on
the Delia, there he was floatin' in the
water on a board.
"You see, the suction of the ship go
in' down had lifted the hurricane-deck
clean off an' let him out, an' there he
was.

the captain, as two shrill sounds came
out of the darkness.

of the other, "I'm more excited this
minute tellin' about it than i was do

"Now, starboard, Charlie, star

the pilothouse deck and blew an an
swering signal to the big barge which
e presently came floating toward us in
D the wide expanse, with a half-dozen
schooners, loaded to the water's edge,

t The favorite passenger sat silent,
her eye on the set young face of the
man at the wheel, turning, as his
duty was, his wheel to the left
e when his orders were to go right, and
to the right when he was to go to the
h left. "I think," 'said she, contempla
tively, "if there were a little more
common sense in the making of steer
ing-gear, such accidents as yours
wouldn't happen."

quizzically, and considered her words.

a One on the Chicago Man.
i' The different ways in which dealers
i, advertise their wares are sometimes
very clever. At an uptown shoe store
there is a sign in the window on which
e is pasted three one dollar bills, and un
derneath this inscription: "Three of a
1' kind beats two pair."
t The other day a Chicago drummer
stepped briskly into the store and in
f quired of the clerk after looking at the
u sign: "Do you do business according
to HIoyle?"
"Yes, sir.," was the reply.
e "Well," said the drummer, "I'll take
two pair of shoes."
"All right," said the clerk. "What
. size?"
"Two pair of nines."
a "But." interposed the clerk, "accord.
- ing to Hoyle three of a kind don't beat
r four of a kind."
d "I knew you New York fellows
r would get ahead of us somehow," was

He was in the hablpf keeping odd
cigars, chocoldtt % ~ t things of that a
sort lying around~b office desk, and sa
the clerks, m and office boy a
were in the habit of h ping themselves
without so much as asking the priv- h
ilege. It was sometise before he took z
any official notice of i But of late he t:
could-scarcely turn around-before every- r
thing was gone. When this freedom b
finally extended to the disappearance t
of little boxes of bon-bons purchased v
for his wife he began to inquire into it. b
"It's that boy," suggested the clerk.
"Indeed, I never tech 'em," said the 1
boy. "Everybody what comes along n
bites into everything.", d
The next day the proprietor brought t
home some doctored lozenges and wvent I
out to lunch, leaving a box half full on 1
his desk in plain sight About ag hour 1
after his return to the office one of the a
clerks in the next room came in and 1
asked to be excused for the rest of the a
day on account of illness. As soon as t
the man had gone an investigation of r
the lozenge box betrayed the fact that I:
all had disappeared. lHe rang his bell a
and the office boy appeared, pale and t
trembling. a
"Look here, Billy," says he, "I left
some lozenges on my desk at noon-I v

"No, sir, I didn't see 'em." a
"I'm glad of that," said the employer. I
"Of course, you wouldn't have touched f

have done so. Not that they were of t
any value particularly, but because c
they were fixed up for cat medicine. c

another clerk. lie was accompanied I
by a man friend, and both looked high- I
ly embarrassed and uneasy. Billy had
rushed in upon them and told them in
an awful whisper that they had all 1
been poisoned. They manfully faced c
the music.
"I-we-that is-"
"Ah, I see!" interrupted the boss.
"You, too, have been eating my cat 1
medicine!" He tried to -look serious,
but his i. not a serious nature, and he 1
laughed instead. The young men be

"Then they ain't-were not poisoned?
Billy says they were fixed for rats, sir.

but"
' Oh, they were not exactly poisoned,

you'll go down to the corner drug store
and take an emetic you'll be all right
in a short time."
Both young nmen disappeared in a
twinkling, and the laughing old practi

lighted a fresh cigar. "It is well
enough not to let them off to easily,"
he soliloquized. "They'd have gotten

WOMEN DISGUISED AS MEN.
Romantic Storles Reealled by .a Brrtisl
War Oice Incident.
The late Col. Burnaby told of the
discovery of a woman who served as a
soldier in the ranks of the army of Don
Carlos in 1874. She wore the uniform
and lived and fought just as the other
soldiers, but a priest in whose parish
she had lived identified her. Don Car
los 'removed her to the nurses' quar
ters, but she begged to be sent back to
the ranks. He laughed. "Not to the
regiment of men, but when I form a
battalion of women you shall be
colonel."
In Australia not so many years ago
there was a woman who traveled under
the alias of Edward de Lacy Evans.
For years she was a miner at Bendigo.
She is stated to have been married as
a man three times. Her true sex was
discovered upon her reception into Kew
lunatic asylum. She eventually re
covered her reason and returned to the
outer world.
The career of Marv Ann Talbot con
tains a still further flavor of romance.
She was the reputed daughter of the
earl of Talbot, and at fourteen years
she fell into the hands of a certain
Capt. Bowen of the royal navy. The
captain, being ordered to San Domin
go, took her with him, disguised as a
page boy. When Capt. lowen was
killed in action Mary Ann changed her
flag and entered the French navy. She
then entered the American merchant
marine. She quickly-of course, still
in male disguise-became a favorite
with the captain of the vessel, and he
took her home with him. His niece
fell in love with the pretty sailor boy,
as she considered him, and proposed
marriage herself. The proposal Mary
Ann deemed it prudent to ac
cept, and it was arranged that
the marriage should be celebrated
on the sailor's return from the next
voyage. It is hardly necessary to say
that this gay deceiver had no intention
whatever of going back. Landing in
England, Mary Ann was arrested as a
deserter from the British navy, and, to
escape further service, she confessed
her sex. The story of her adventures
immediately spread abroad and created
a considerable sensation at the time.
The then duke of York procured for
her a pension, and she received numer
ous and handsome presents from him
and from others.
It is strikingly noticeable that many
of these Amazons were fatally attrac
tive to their own sex. As we haveseen,
Mary Ann Talbot unwittingly capti
vated the heart of the American cap
tain's niece, while "Edward de Lacy
Evans," who married three wives, must
also have been a very pretty fellow.

SAT ON THE HOT RAILS.
A Band of Apmehes Olvea a surprlse on  
Hants we Traon.
"For real hot-weather stories you
want to go to a hot-weather country," a
says W. F. White, passenger traffic
manager of the Santa Fe railroad. 1
"Now you can find hot weather that is
hot weather in New Mexico and Ari
zona. It's one thing to go through 1
that country now on a train which car- c
ries the conveniences for keeping cool,
but it was quite another thing when
the railroad was being built and there a
was nothing between you and the sun l
but fiery alkali dust.
"The Atchison road reached Deming, *
N. M., in 1881, and it was a hot sum
mer. It had been hot right along for c
days in that steady, energetic fashion
that would make a man wish for an
hour in a Bessemer steel mill to cool off.
The first construction train pulled into
Deming on a day that was so scorching 1
as to stand out even among those other i
blistering days. The train was made
up of a long line of fiat ears, and along
the center of the cars ran a pile of steel 1
rails a foot high. The rails had been
in the full glare of an unblinking sun
until they were about as hot as when
they first came through the rolls at the
mill.
"When the train came into Deming it
was, of course, an object of great in
terest, and no one was more inter
ested than a lot of Apache Indians.,
They were peaceful enough, and
filled with curiosity and were
quick to assert the birthright of
the American Indian to ride free
on a railroad train. The conductor in
charge was something of a joker, and
saw an opportunity for some fun. He
urged the Indians all to climb up on the
fiat cars and have a ride. The engineer
was in the scheme, and, as soon as the
Indians were up on the cars he backed
his engine with a jerk. They could ride
I a bucking pony under any condition of
unsteadiness. but this motion was new
L to them, and the entire party sat down
I on the rails.
"Now, you must remember the sum
mer costume of an Apache can be cut
out of a pocket handkerchief with cloth
t to spare. Well, my idea of Indian stoi
cism was shattered. There were shrieks
that added new notes to the regulation
war whoop, and the Apaches left that
train and started off across the hot
sands in a way that would have turned
its all gray if they had been coming
toward us instead of running away.
They undoubtedly to this minute re
member that as the hottest day they
f ever knew."--Chicago Tribune.
t A NATURAL THOUGHT.
L Why the Pullmnan Porter Kept the Roll of
1tll5.
After Mr. Scadds left the station he
1 experienced a severe shock upon di.
covering that a packet of bank notes
which he was taking to the city was
nowhere about his person.
He must have left it in the Pullman
car.
"I'll go to the superintendent's office
and make my loss known," he thought,
and he did. "I left a package contain
ing $5,000 in bank notes in a Pullman
car not half an hour ago," said Mr.
' Scadds to the officer.
"WVhich train?"
e "The one which arrived at 9:15."
S"lave you your Pullman check?"
' Fortunately he had. and this enabled
the superintendent to send for the con
r ductor.
He soon arrived, for he had not yet
finished the report of his trip, and was
still in the building.
i "Conductor," said the superintend
ent, "did you sec anything of a pack
a age left in your car?"
c "'No, sir."
"Bring, the porter here."
o He was brought.
r "Did you see anything of a small
package after the passengers left your
car?"
"Yes, sah."
"You haven't turned it in?"
V "Why, no, sah. It was a lot of money,
sah."
e "Precisely. Where is it now?"
"Here, sah."
It was .produced from an inside pock
et.
C MIr. Secadd's eyes brightened when he
saw the roll. "That's it," he exclaimed.
n He counted the money, and it was all
e there, the entire five thousand dollars.
I-I "Look here, porter," said the super
intendent, severely. "I want to know
5 why you did not bring that package to
me the moment you got your fingers on
e it?"
"Why, sah," replied the man with an
injured air, "I s'posed de gemman had
e left it for a tip, sah. That's why, sah."

ANTIQUE GLASS.
1 Priceless Bits That Have Survved AL
r Other Art Forms.
The world of the Mediterranean sea,
eighteen centuries ago, was rich in
works of art and decoration beyond our
experience, and beyond our flights of
imagination. It is an effort which few
of us can make with success to picture
the wealth in beautiful art of a great
city of the empire. The marbles have
been burned to lime, the bronzes have
e been melted into gros sons or their
1. equivalent, the stuccoes have crumbled
.1 I from the walls, the paintings have gone
. down with their walls to ruin, the
- shattered pottery has been used in fill
v ing and grading and building, and its
o remaining fragments are of no value
a except for an inscription or an im
pressed name-mere postherds, with
o now and then a scrap of antiquarian
d interest. The shattered glass alone
" contains in its very substance such
beauty, and such completeness even in
ruin, that its fragments are treasured
up and studied. These broken bits
a point to a general use of vessels of dec
lI orative glass, used as we use porcelain
d for the finer vessels of table and toilet,
e and also a great abundance of objects
g of pure ornament, of wall-linings and
" floor-coverings, made of the same splen
did material. No other substance is
t like that-beautitful in itself, in its
1- every essence. FragEments of glass
1I have often the value that fragments of
o pottery sometimes have-the partial
a figure, the incomplete pattern on the
surface; and they have also what no
pottery and no other artificial sub
stance has-the beauty we generally
think of as pecnliar to natural stones,
Sto agates and to jaspers. As a collector
y fills his cabinet with pieces of precious
and semi-precious stones, with here
Sand there a piece which has, as it hap
pens, a head or a piece of a head carved
- upon it,so the enthusiastic vitreologist
collecbts glass as glass, loving its sub
.d stance and its surface, its color and its
Stexture, its translucency and its opac
Sity, its set patterns and its ,vague,
eloudings; here and there a stamped or I
a wheel-ground pattern adds its own
attractiveness, but th- glass itself is
a the thing! Precious and beautiful io

the present writer it seems not too'
much to say that in certain light ,thi
Obelisk is the most imposing simple ~bi
ject of great dimensions in the wholes
world. Doubtless when seen, as it
always can be seen by day, from a dis
tance of two or three miles and from
different parts of the city, out off by a.

there is nothing remarkable or beauti

an obelisk, and nothing more; a
der straight line of stone visible.in an
uninteresting atmosphere. Even th~a
it can hardly be said to be offensive,
for it is too simple to offend.
Go to it at evening, when the sunset
lights have faded and the full moon is
rising.. It is impossible not to see its
beauty then. For some reason not im
mediately apparent the .white light is
not reflected from the lower half of it
when the moon is not far above the
horizon. The lines are all there, but
the shaft is only a soft shadow below,
gradually growing clearer as it rises,
and sending in a blaze'of silver against
the dark sky. The enormous propor
tions are touched then with a profound&
mystery; the solidity of the symbol
disappears, the greatness of the
thought remains, the unending vast
ness of the idea is overwhelming.
Block upon block, line by line, it was
built up with granite from many into
one simple whole, a true symbol of
what we Americans are trying to make
of ourselves, of our country, and of
our belieft. There is the solid founda
tion. proved and tried,. which we
know of and trust in. There is the
dark and shadowy present, through
which the grand straight lines are felt
rather than seen. And there, itighin
the still air, points the gleaming fu
ture, perfect at all points, bright at all
points, lofty as all -but Heaven itself.
There is the symboL We may ask of
ourselves whether we are to overtake
the shadows and reach the light, we or
our children, or our children's children;
or whether the half-darkness will creep
up with us always, and with them, for
ages to come. and even to the end.
The Obelisk is beautiful not only by
moonlight, as anyone may see who will Cr
take the trouble to look at it with eyes
human rather than critical-at evening,
for instance, from the terrace of the
capitol, when all the wbtld 'isrinking
toward its mighty plunge into dark
ness through the foam of the cloud
breakers and the purple wash of night's
rising tide; or at early morning, when
the darkness sinks back, and the
first blush of day . warms the
pinnacle of the lonely shaft-as
though it had stabbed night in the
sky and drawn the sweet blood of day
I light upon its point. Most notably is
It beautiful at such times when seen
with the whole city from the great
military cemetery on the heights of Ar
t lington, than which few points in the
world command a more lovely view.
There in the quiet earth the solemn
; dead lie side by side, the many who
fought for us when we were but their
r children, and who, for ours, will fight
I their immortal battles again in the
i clouds like the warriors of old. Many
of us have heroes of our name and race
lying there in the broad tree-hemmed
meadows, and among the flowers, and
in that chosen rank where the great
generals lie, as they fought in the fore
front of the enemy, facing now not
enemies but friends, the deep sweet
valley with the quiet river at their
fect. And far away, beside the airy
dome of the capitol, the single shaft
rises sunward, and tells in shadow
r time for us, the living, the hours of the
dead men's endless day. -Marion Craw
