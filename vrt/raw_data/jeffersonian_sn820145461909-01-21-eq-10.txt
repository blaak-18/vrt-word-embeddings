KING COTTON’S IMPROVERISH
ED RETINUE.
(Continued from Page Three.)
Out of that two hundred and fifty
dollars he must provide for his fam
ily, himself, and his mule, and make
provision for the ensuing times of
planting and cultivating. Fully sixty
five per cent, of America’s cotton is
produced by this straggling method.
Up to 1903, when the great movement
in cotton prices blessed the Southern
industry with the transforming gleam
of prosperity, ninety per cent, of our
cotton crop was harvested in this same
hopeless way.
In 1898 I made my usual trip South.
Those were dismal times in the land
of cotton. It was a period of poverty
and despair. Cotton was only five
cents a pound and frequently sold be
low that price in the interior. The ex
planation of the spinner regarding this
five-cent rate was that it was fixed
by the laws of supply and demand.
The Southern planter said that the
cause of the ruinous rate was oppres
sion. In my opinion it was neither.
It was ignorance, ignorance on the
part of the planter, because he did
not realize his impregnable position
in having a monopoly of the most val
uable fruit of the soil, and because he
did not assert his rights. And igno
rance on the part of the spinners and
manufacturers, because they clung to
the musty old idea that in buying
their raw material at the lowest possi
ble price and turning out finished
products they were doing their full
duty as business men. This cotton
selling at five cents was the same cot
ton that Lancashire had fought to get
in 1864 at $1.90 a pound. It was the
same cotton for which lives were risk
ed in running blockades in the Civil
War. There appeared to be some
thing the matter.
On that trip I saw how discourage
ment had taken the nerve out of the
farmers. Cottonseed was dumped in
heaps, beaten by rain, covered with
sleet. Farms were ill kept, with build
ings and fences dilapidated. If the
time ever came, I thought, I should
like to take a hand and put cotton
where it belonged. I knew the face
of that sodden landscape would
change.
Upon visiting Raleigh, North Caro
lina, in 1906, I was approached by a
gentleman who wanted me to go out
and look at a farm which was produc
ing two and one-half bales of cotton
to the acre. I thought the man was
insane, or trying to lead me astray.
Nevertheless I went out to this farm,
and, much to my surprise, I discov
ered that land which two years pre
viously had been raising bumblebee
cotton, or cotton which derives its
name from the countryside legend that
a bumblebee can sit on its hind legs
and take the fruit from the boll, was
now producing two and one-half bales
to the acre. I learned that the overseer,
who had been employed for his up-to
date methods and producing on this
very land cotton that was yielding two
and one-half bales to the acre, was
doing it entirely on the basis of scien
tific farming and the selection of the
best seed from the first pick of the
crop.
This is simply an illustration of
what could happen if all the lands of
"©be 3effwsonlan
could be the source of immense reve
nue for capital that would have the
courage to invest in revolutionizing
the crude existing methods in the cot
ton fields.
In whatever way we regard the crop
of cotton we find features that are un
connected with any other harvest. The
growing of cotton, alone of all plant
life, does not exhaust the soil. This
has been a mystery to science.
“Land that has be£n planted in cot
ton for forty successive years in Boli
var County, Mississippi,” says a De
partment of Agriculture report, “pro
duces just as well the last year as it
did the first.” That being true, what
prodigal results await the planter
when to get greater harvest he begins
scientifically to treat the soil unde
pleted through a generation and more
of successive harvests!
In all the years it has been in use
there has not been a single improve
ment on the cotton gin invented by
Eli Whitney. Its ability to tear and
disfigure the fiber is just as it was
when Whitney invented it. Cleaner
work would mean a saving of thou
sands.
The World Against the Cotton
Grower.
The whole world is combined
against the Southern farmers to keep
down the price of their product, and
they must combine along similar lines
of intellectual and progressive meth
ods to meet and overcome this antago
nism. Tenant farmers are under an
enormous handicap, and the land
owner knows that high prices mean
ability on the part of the tenant to get
out from under the yoke and become
independent; this the land owner does
not wish. The mill owner and the
weaver want cheap cotton. The South
ern farmers must combine; must re
strict their crop along the lines of
actual supply and demand; must aban
don their slipshod methods of farm
ing and resort to scientific processes;
must diversify their crops and must
stand together. That is something I
shall have more to say about later.
Tn advancing new ideas regarding
cotton we must expect to encounter
the conservatism that has hindered
progress in every line. After Whit
ney’s gin was patented and improved,
and the production of cotton had risen
to ten million pounds, the planters
of America were stricken with fear
that the market would be permanently
overstocked. Gazing in astonish
ment at the output of a gin which
could separate more cotton in a day
than he could have done in a life
time, one of the startled planters ex
claimed, “I have done with the culti
vation of cotton; there’s enough in
that gin-house to make stockings for
all the people of America.”
Until recent years the seed and
stalks of the cotton were worse than a
waste; they were in the way. Today
the seed formerly a nuisance produces
an income for the farmer, pays the
wages of many people employed in
the world, the salaries of officers, divi
dends on capital invested, fattens
more than a million head of cattle
for the market, and feeds three mil
lion of the younger generation of
steers. Moreover this cotton seed
yields a revenue equal to sixty-five per
