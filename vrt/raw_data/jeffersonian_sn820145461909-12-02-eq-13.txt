Jeffersonian Club News
(CONCLUDED FROM PAGE ten)
months of work to organize enough
clubs to entitle them to a State
League.
To give these friends an oppor
tunity to join the National League,
and at the same time to guard the
clubs against the intrusion of unde
sirable members, we have decided to
ask each one to do a little work for
the good of the order. The mere
payment of a small membership fee
is not sufficient safeguard. We want
none but those who are with us,
heart and soul, and above all we
want WORKERS—men and women
who will WORK for the reforms
which they believe in. Our plan is
this: —
A Working Membership.
Any man of the white race may be
come a member of the National
League of Jeffersonian Clubs by sign
ing the pledge printed below and
mailing it to The Jeffersonian,
Thomson, Ga., accompanied by three
new subscriptions to The Jeffersonian
or Watson’s Magazine at the full
price of one dollar each, on receipt of
which we will enter the member’s
name for a year’s subscription to the
magazine or weekly, and will forward
certificate of membership, copy of
platform and by-laws, and the club
button.
Any woman of the white race may
become an honorary member of the
National League of Jeffersonian
Clubs under the conditions named
above.
x Local Club Membership.
In places where local Clubs have
been established, any eligible person
who wishes to become a member, and
is not in a position to pay the club
dues, may send in two subscriptions
to The Jeffersonian or Watson’s
Magazine at the full price of one dol
lar each, on receipt of which we will
send in his name to his local club
for membership and enter him for a
year’s subscription to the magazine or
weekly.
Object—Education.
The real object of these clubs is the
education of the people, and every
cent of the money that is raised will
be spent for the attainment of that
end. Two millions and a half of
the voters in this country can neither
read nor write, and of the remaining
twenty millions of those who vote
for President and Congressmen, and
help to arrive at momentous decisions
on governmental questions of vital
import to the welfare of the nation, a
large proportion are utterly and dis
gracefully ignorant of the elemen
tary principles upon which our gov
ernment was founded. By the distribu
tion of literature, the employment of
lecturers, and more especially the
free discussion of social and political
questions in the clubs, we hope to do
a little towards the education of the
voter.
A Public Menace.
The illiterate and ignorant voter
is a constant menace to the nation.
In most cases he can be driven or cor
rupted, and always his vote follows
his personal feelings or advantage.
Such conditions can be improved only
by long and patient work in educat
ing the masses of the people, and in
this work the Jeffersonian Clubs can
do a vast amount of good. Their
meetings can be made attractive by
adding social features; their discus
sions can interest the public by taking
up live questions, local, State or na
tional; they can establish libraries
and reading rooms; they can bring
the younger folks to their banner by
organizing junior branches; and last,
but by no means least, they can en
list the sympathy and active aid of
the women of America.

Platform.
11. Our platform is—
“We stand for the public own
ership of all public utilities,
such as railroads, telegraphs,
telephones, express compa
nies, municipal water, light,
3effersonian
and street car systems.
“We stand for the constitution
al money system of the fath
ers. We say that all the
money—no matter what it is
made out of—is the creature
of law, and that every bit of
it should be created by the
Government, and issued di
rectly to the people; and that
every dollar so created should
be the equal of every other.
“We stand for the Income Tax;
for the Initiative, Referen
dum and Recall; for a Par
cels-post, and the Postal Sav
ings Bank.
“We favor the placing of the
necessaries of life on the free
list.
“We favor every just demand of
labor, —the eight-hour day in
such industries as workshops,
mining and manufacturing;
the abolition of child-slavery;
the compulsory adoption of
life-saving inventions, etc.
“We oppose the national bank
ing system; the alien owner
ship of land, and the holding
by railroads and other cor
porations of vast areas which
are not necessary to their le
gitimate business.
“We demand the election of
United States Senators by di
rect vote of the people.
“We declare that the irresisti
ble power of the Government
should not be used to build
up one industry at the ex
pense of another.
“We demand the withdrawal of
the special privileges which
create private monopolies
and trusts. We say that so
long as monopoly privileges
remain in private hands, they
should be taxed to the full
value of the privileges.”
A Pure Democracy.
12. Our constitution, organization
and by-laws shall be subject to
change at any time by a majority
vote of the members of this club, on
local matters; or by a majority vote
of all the clubs in the State, on
State affairs, under the State organ
ization of Jeffersonian Clubs; or by
a majority vote of all the clubs in
the United States, on national af
fairs, under the national organiza
tion of Jeffersonian Clubs. In other
words, this club, and the State and
national unions of Jeffersonian
Clubs, shall be a pure democracy,
and their officers and constitution
shall be controlled by the members,
and by the members alone. We
recognize no authority in the affairs
o the Jeffersonian Clubs, except
that which comes from the people.
Let the People rule.
