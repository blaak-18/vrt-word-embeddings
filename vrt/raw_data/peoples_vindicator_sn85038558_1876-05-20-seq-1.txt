We Can Make Home Happy.
Though we may not change the cottage
For mansions tall and grand,
Or exchange the little grass plat
For a boundless stretch of land
Yet there:'s something brighter, dearer,
Than the wealth we'd thus command.
Though we have no means to purchase
Costly pictures rich and rare
Tlhough we have no silken hangings
For the walls so cold and bare,
We can hang thetm o'er with garlands,
For flowers bloom everywhere.
We can make home very cheerful
If the right course we begin;
We can make its inmates happy
And their truest blessings win;
It will m:tke a small room brighter
If we let the sunshine in.
We can gather 'reund the firciu le
When the evening hours Iare long
We can blend our hearts and voices
In a happy social song;
We can guide some erring brother,
Lead him fiomn the path of wrong.
We may fill our homes with music
And with sunshine brinmming o'er,
If against all dark intruders
We will tirlnly close the door;
Yet should the evil shadow enter,
W, must love each other more.
There are treasures for the lowly,
Which the grandest fail to find ;
There's a, chain of sweet aftection
Bringing friends of kindred mind;
We may reap the choicest blessings
From the poorest lot assigned.
The Coquette's Punishment.
"So Julia Nottingham is engaged
at last," said Mrs Whitely. "Well,
I'm sure I'm very glad to hear it."
But she spoke in a tone which be
lied her words. For, somehow, Julia
Nottingham was not popular among
the ladies of her acquaintance.
"O, yes, said Mrs. Sibthlorpe, with
sagacious nod of the head. "I have
it from the very best authority-her
own unt."
"Indeed ! said Mrs. Mrs. Sibthorpe.
"Fifty years old, and bald.'
"O!"said Mrs Whitely. "There's
no fool like an old fool.
"Keeps his own carriage and hors
es, and has bought an elegant coun
try seat."
"Julia will queen it now," said Mrs.
Whiteley, almost enviously.
Mrs. Whiteley, be it understood,
was a widow not quite past the boun
daries of youth, and not at all averse
to a second marriage with some eligi
ble parti.
"And how about Clarence Egerton ?"
"0, she's thrown him over, of
course," said Mrs. Sihthorpe. "That
was nothing but a flirtation."
"Some people have all the hick,"
sighed Mrs. Whitelay.
And while her good fortune was
the subject of popular gossip, Miss
Nottingham herself sat in her own
room at hIome, complacently survey
ing the solitaire pearls embedded in
blue vervet, and the mraguilicentdead
gold bracelets, which had just arrived
with Mr. i'hilpotts' card attached.
"How superb !" said Mrs. Notting
ham, a brisk iittle woman, with gray
curls and a suspiciously unchanging
bloom on each cheek.
"0, yes," said Julia, indifferently.
"But I wish his name was anything
but Philpotts."
"Shakspeare says, 'What's in a
name ' "archly rejoined the mother.
"Viery likely ," said Miss Netting
hamu, with a toss of the head ; but
you see Shakspeare wasn't 'joung
lady just about to be married.,
And she thought regretfully, not
withstanding her callows coquette
heart, of poor Clarence Egerton, who
had magnificent curls and a profile
like Adonis.
But she went smilingly down to
meet her middle-agedjiancee that af
ternoon.
"My own Julia ! said Mr. Philpotts,
beamingly.
"Dear Hiram I" sweetly responded
Juha, with a little swallow of the un
romantic Christian name in her throat.
"I have brought you a bouquet for
Mrs. Poddingfon's reception to-night,"
said Mr. Philpotts, producing a mira
cle of the florist art, wrapped in as
many silver papers as a mummy.
"How kind of you, love," said Miss
Nottingham.
"I will call for you in the carriage
at 9 precisely," added Philpotts.
"I'm sure it's very considerate,
dear," smiled Julia.
"And here," bringing out of his
pocket a heavy gold necklace, from
which hung a diamond-set .Jocket,
"is a trifile which I hope you will
obligeme by nearing to-night."
Julia's eyes sparkled. Sim was a
miser at heart, and gold and diamonds
were very beautiful in her eyes. It
was worth while, she reflected to
marry a man old enough to be her
father, for the sake of treasures such
as these.
But when the carriage eame that
evening to convey her to Mrs. Pod
dington's ball it was empty, and the
servant handed her a note from Mr.
Philpotts. He had an attack of his
old enemy, the rheumatism, hIe wrote,
and found himself most reluctantly
compelled to remain at horne.
"All the better," said Miss Julia to
herseltf, with a last glance at the mir
ror before she wrapped the white
cashmere opera cloak about her
shoulders, and tripped lightly down
stairs. "I can have a charming time
with poor, dear Clarence, who is
never at a loss for something to say,
and waltaes beautifully."
Miss nottingham was not displeased
with her own appearance, in silver
green silk, half-hidden by snowy
tulle, and a set of emeralds, which
had been Mr. Philpotts' gift.
"Yes," said she, witlh a compacent
little nod, as her mother complimsnt
ed her on Iter becoming dress, "it's
all well enough. But Just wait Intil
I come out in black velvet and dia
monds as a matron."
Miss NottinghU bajoyed. herself
that evening. She Walsed to her
heart's codtent, flirted enough for
three. an4 hlnall!.dimpare4 arlin the
green recess of the conservatory with
the straight nosed Clarence Egerton.
The Poddingtons had more money
than they knew what to do with, and
had expended a goodly portion of it
in tie decoration of the great arched
palace of plate glass which opened
out of the supper room. Acacias
brushed the roof, passion vines swung
their purple cups on every side, and
a little grove of palms and oleanders
in the center inclosed a sparkling
fountain of cool spray, which tinkled
down among mossy rocks, and into
clusters of pale green ferns, like a
forest waterfall.
Just within this enchanted nook a
rustic seat afforded an excellent corn
er for flirtation, and of course Miss
Julia Nottingham and her rejected
swain found their way into it.
"Now don't be ridiculous Clarence,"
said Julia. "Let go my hand."
"But you shall answer ume first,"
persisted Clarence. "You shall tell
me whether you really love this old
moneymnaking machine you're going
to marry."
"Of course I don't love himn !"
"And you do not love me 1"
"Well, yes, I do-if that will be
any satisfaction to you."
"Then, Julia, it is me you should
wed !" cried out the young man.
"Now you are getting silly again,"
said Julia, imperiously nitlhdrawing
the hand which Mr. Egerton had con
trived to keep captive until then.
"When you know very well that your 1
entire income would hardly keep ne
in gloves and slippers !"
"Julia!"
"It's as well to be honest about it," I
said Miss Nottingham. "I do like
you the best-and I shall appoint you
my chevalier-in-chief when I am I
married. To carry my fan and bou
quets, you know, and take me out to i
morning concerts and matinees, I
when my husband is at the bank. But
old Philpotta is rich-and that's why I
I intend to marry him. Of coure 1i
don't love him-who could be expect- I
ed to love a bald-headed old man like
that ? But I dare say I shall make a
very good wife ; and lie can't live for
ever, you know, so when I am a rich
widow I mean to suit myself."
"Don't I beg of you, wait for that !"
cried out a hoarse voice, half-choked m
with rage.
And to Miss Nottingham's great i
dismay and surprise, Mr. Philpotts I
himself tumbled into the fountain
sparkling nook.
"I'm a bald-headed old man, an! I I
--'ui a mere money making machine ?
Miss Nottingham, I could't have cred
ited this if I hadn't heard it with mily
olu ears. Perhaps you will one day
be a rich widow, Miss Nottingham,
but you won't be mine. I beg to re
lease you from your engagemen."'
And Mr. Philpotts stalked out of the I
fairy bower.
Miss Nottingham sat looking after ,
hint with clasped hands, and a tface
as pale as ashes. Clarence Egerton 1
pulled hand at his mustache.
"Upon mly word, said he, secretly en
joying the discomfiture of the young la- r
dy who had so cooly thrown him over
but a few weeks since, "this is what I
one would call a pretty kettle of fish. 1
The old chap mustbhave heard every
word."
It was quite true. Mr. Philpotts I
finding himself better as the . our
for the reception approached
had resolved to give Miss Nottingham
an agreeable surprise. He dresseda
himselfand came to Mrs. Podding
ton's, a little late, to be sure, but yet
in tolerable good time. Hearing from
some one that Miss Nottingham had
gone into the conservatory, he inno-i
nocently followed her thither, and
heard what the reader already knows.
Miss Nottingham's wedding-dress~
was never worn, and she is still on
tile lookout for a successor to the rich
old tman' that she did uot marry.

The Country Editor.
SLet us now pen a picture of tile
eountry editor, to be seen in every .
country village of any pretensions
whatever.
The country editor is obliged to
prepare his own editorials on all the a
leading questions of the day. To do
this hle must "read up" coutinually,
and unless bts editorial rakes into
some one, or tears up some interest
he is not able to hide under the cover
of his journal, but must take a show
er of oaths for being stale. If lie
rakes into parties or measures lie of
course receives the shower all the
same. He is expected to blow the
horn of every aspirant for political
aspirent for political favor in his par- i
ty, and at the same time if he asks
such aspirant to help him "raise tile
wind" with which to "toot his horn,"
he is told that some individual who
has swung his hat, three or four
time over his head, must be laken
care of, and he must stand aside.
The country editor must take an
interest in all lecal matters. He must
advocate all public improvements and
thereby win the hate and lasting en
muity of tax payers, who are opposed
to public inmprovements. If hle does I
not advocate improvements, then the
masses call him the paid tool of rich
tax payers. He must attend all meet
ings aud coonventions, and if ihe fill
to report the same in full, hle is said
Ito be behind all live journals. He
must write up local spicy musatter, and
if hie notices an improvement made
Ihy. Mr. A., he falls under the lash of
Mr. B., because he did not happen to
be aware that Mr. B. bad made im
I provements also, which were twice as
great, on his property.
If the coatry editor obtains ad
vertising, he onustgofor it personally.
Every timeee turns around he must
I torn over a sixpence, or the stzpencee
Swill tora him over. He is personally
aheld aeountable for all typographl.,
f cal errors in his journal, and muest
r oversee the "alse up" and prioting
of his paper, and if e has a job of-.[
' ge attt!lled to sis establismrd W
must look after stock, drum up work,
and personally attend to the details
of the jobbing. Ile mast select all
mliscellany, comiile all news itemns,
write obituaries, 'and take a hand at
providing inoS(iiee for such of Ins
readers as like it. Besides all this lie is
at the financial head of an institution
that would lpe'rplex even a banker and
his score of assistants. HIis subscrip
tion list must he worked up, and
kept up too, andl he must see to it,
that all subscribers "pay iup"' in course
of time. HIe must collect pay for his
advertisements, and job work, and
unless he has a large stock of pa
tience and forbearance, lie will oc
casionally get mad. when told to "go
to the devil with his little picayune
bill." He must have the soul of an
angel, the vigor of a steam engine, the
check of the evil one. the patience of
Job, eyes as numerous as the stars of
heaven, aI disposition as smooith as
oil, to be iable to dispense with all
tender feelings, and lie imllperturble
to blows froml every jackass's heels
in his jouirnalistic diocese. Who can
edit a conniry journal and be happy.
-Whitehall (N. Y.) Times.
A Fearful Summons.
"Mr. Smith, T called to see if I
could take your life."
"'WhV-whl-whlat d'you say ?" ex
claimed Smith, in some alarm.
"I say that I've come around to
take yoir life. My name is GOnn.
As soon as I heard you were unpro
tected, that you had nothing on your
life, I thought I would just run in and
settle the thing for you at once."
Then Smith got up and went to the
other side of the table, and said to
himself :
"It's a lunatic wiho has broken out
of the asylum. He'll kill nme if hal
loo or run. I must humor him.
Then Gunn, fumbling in his pocket
after his mortality tables, followed
Smith around the room, and said to
him :
"You can choose your own plan,
you know. It's immaterial to me.
Some like one way and somne like an
other. It's a matter of taste. Which
one do you prefer I"
"I'd rather not die at all," Smith
said, in despair.
"But you've got to die, of course,"
said Gunn ; "that's a thing there's no
choice about. All I can do is to make
it easy for you ; to make you feel hap
py as you go off. Now which plan
will you take 9"
"Couldn't you postpone it until to
morrow, so as to give me time to
think ?"
"No; I prefer to take you on the
spot. I might as well do it now as at
any other time. You have a wife and
children ?"
"Yes; and I think you ought to
have some consideration for them and
let me off."
"Well, that's a curious kind of an
argument," said Gunn. "When I
take you your family will be perfect
ly protected, of course, and not other
wise."
"But why do you want to murder
me I"
"Murder you! Murder you l Who
in the thunder's talking about mur
dering you 7"
"Why, didn't you say"-
"I called to get you to take out a
life insurance policy in our compaiy,
and I"
"Oh, you did, did you t said Smith,
suddenly becoming fierce. "Well, I
ain't going to do it, and I want you
to skip out of this otffice oj' I'll brain
you with the poker"i
Then Mr. Guln rwithdrew without
selling a policy, and Smithl is still un
insured.

tLETTERS.-By many things we may

and the woman he mighlt Ihave ar

he better known than by his letters,
and how he writes, and whether hie is

script written across ithe page, and
diflficult to decipher. All these traits
come in as parts of the puzzle, by
which, when fitted together, can be
read the true nature of a man. The
tiresonme and trustwortlhy, the egotis
tical, and the exactc, tihe affectionate,
the conscientious, the ostentatious
each writes a different kind of letter ;

Dusliug a recent performance at a
Paris theatre, a mtan and his wife had
a quarrel on thie stage--the woman in
a rage of jealousy, the man trying to
pursuade her that sihe was too sus
picious and too passionate. Both
were acting with great spirit, whenm
the wife moved her arm too near a
candle, and her muslin dress was in
iames in an instant. Both actors
kept their presence of mind, however.
The husband extinguished the fire,
and, proeeding with lie part, inter

them to a paste with a third of their
volume of fresh butter, then add the 4
anchovies, a quarter teaspoonful of $
mace, and as much cayenne as will

A nseful Discoveryv.--It is worth
knowing that if one volume of castor
oil be dissolved in two (orI three vo
uames of spirits of wine, it will ren
der paper transparent, andtl, tile spiriits
rapidly evaporating, tihe paper in a
few mlinutes beoales fit ifor use. A
drawing in plencil or in Indian ink
can thus be ma;de, and if tile paper
is placed in spirits of wine, the oil is
dissolved out, restoring tihe ipaper to
its original condition. This is the
discovery of Hlerr Furrscher.
