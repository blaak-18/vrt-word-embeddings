Utnderstood at Last.
With a just understanding of the
situation at the South by our north
ern bretheren and a cessation of per.
secution on the party of malignant
party leaders of the radical faction,
we may look for an era of prosperity
as well as peace. Already has this
fraternal feeling developed itself tea
remarkable extent in so short a time.
The "tidal wave" of "good will" has
made itself felt even in the White
House and the stubborn President has
been at last made to yield to pubhlic
opinion, to begin his "unloading of
the Shysters." This, in itself, is a
grand victory, for up to this moment
he has stood blindly and stubbornly
still and saw his party driven to do
teat and death; a mighty and grand
monument of stupidity and iudiffer
once amid the wreck and destruction
of the "great" party of the Nation.
No one can deny that among the
causes for this great change none can
be reconed of more, or even as much,
magnitude than the action of the
party satelites in Louisiana. Butler
ism, Sanbogiisu, Indian rings, bribe
taking (gifts so-called) and the thous
and other villainies are but single af
fairs in themselves disgraceful; but
when the sanctity of the Legislative
Halls of a severing State are invaded
and the bayonet used to destroy that
sovereign government, at that mo
ment a blow is at once struck at the
liberty of the people and the genius
of our institutions. Louisiana then
is the rock against which the fanatical
horde hurled their strength and npdn
which they were utterly wrecked.
The idea of losing liberty by a
worship of a war hero has at last
developed itself to the North and we
recognize in the expressions of snch
men as Vice-President Wilson, Kelley
and a host of others, heretofore lead
ing republicans, a returning scue of
justice to us, a knowledge at last ac
quired that to preserve their own free
dom, preserve the republic, a decent
and equal right to enjoy the benefits
of liberty and government must be
accorded to the South.
We only ask at the hands of all
parties simple justice, we have been
ravaged by war; but worse than this
is the vile horde of plunderers that
has-feasted and fattened upon. us for
more than eight years, encouraged,
fostered and sustained by the strong
arm of government. We have had
abuses heaped upon us, outrages com
mitted against our persons and liber
ties, sufficient to make any people,
not educated as ours, hate the very
government we live under and drive
them to revolt against its authority
but no such feeling stirs the blood of
any true Southern man, we desirC to
prove our loyalty to the Union, our
love for the Constitution for which
the blood of southern people was shed
as freely as those of the gallant sons
of the North. Our conduct underall
the difficulties we have labored for the
past years since the war closed, are
more than sufficient to prove tlhese as
serfions.
Louisiana then under the ;benign
rule of he' own Sons, str~ngt ened
aind encouraged by the .,leering
words of our Democratic and C6nser
vative brethern of the North, Will gird
on her armor anewand push' herself
to the front rank of improvement
among her sister 8tates. With a cli
mate and soil unsnrpassed :by any
county in the world, well may she be

'JThis whisky raid of Secretary
Bristow, is not likely to ibe productive
of good results. From what we gath
er from the press outside of the "tru I
ly loyal," it is simply a "put up" job
to ruin innocent, honest people, that I
a horde of blood-sucking informers
may be rewarded. The following
from the St. Louis Times "cuts likeI
a knife" into his whisky raiders. In
speaking of the nany' outrages upon
decency and law, which Grant left,
deliberately as if unworthy his atten,
tion; in the lull now before the cam
paign of 1876, to mako a little capital
for himself, he proceeds to unload a
few pounds from his party. It says:
It is the unloading, however, of the
shyster. The whole power of the
United States government is being
I used to make war upon a portion of
its citizens who are powerless to help
themselves, and who without a mur
mour have to submit to arbitrary ar
rests, the injury of criminal charges
made by accusers wholly irresponsi
ble, the loss of credit, the irreparable
damage to business consequent upon
ºofficial prosecution, the loss of lien
I dreds of thousands of dollars, and in
the end, and in nine cases out of ten
the poor boon of an acquittal, bank- "
rnpted in pocket and squeezed as
dry pecuniarily by the hordes of leech
es, and spies, and pimps that pros
e per and thrive in the waters made
muddy by the revenue hypocrites, as
a lemon is squeezed of a mid-summer
night by i patient sick of a fever.
The present whisky raid-begun
-simultaneously in a dozen cities, and
heralded forth with a roar of loyal
newspaper artillery as loud as the
real cannoin of Shiloh-is already one
of the most stupendous farces of the
1 period. That the government means
to rob somebody befobe it gets through
there can scarcely be a doubt. When
a monkey is king, what must his min
isters be; and when a beggar is oen
t horseback, what a terrible gait he
must ride. There are men who deal
in whisky to-day in St. Louis, men
who are identified with St. Louis by
every tie of commercial interest and
business investment that it is possi
f ble to'imagine, men whose honor is
above suspicion, and whose traffic in
whisky is, legitimate and honest in
every way, who will be utterly ruin
t ed by this drunken political raid. See
a how the signs of the gutter put out
D even from the steps of a throne.
Everything that was corrupt, that
was venal, that was hurtful to his
,I party, and dangerous 'to American
liberty, Grant let pass by nureeoguiz- 1
ed only to know the amount of his
profits and interests therein. This
t whisky bIlsiness however, is a mat
r ter which is too largely extended to
be made injurious to any paying
friends, because those who are strick
gen are most likely tow innocent and 1
I honest people, and hence anti-ad.
ministration. His logic is good, but
his sense of justice most atrocious.
The general government has no right
-to war upon its individual citizens,
S much less to prey upon them and de
o your them whenever it is deemed
necessary to make a political corner
in public sentilment. It should not

How Jetties are'Made.
The work of conistructiifg jetties is
much simpler than most petople sup- 1
pose. The general idea was that it a
would take a very long time to im- a
prove the mouth of the Mississippi I
by this means, but the contractors
ore confident that it will require a few
months to d~inonstrate the ptractica- I
bility of the work, and to obtain de- I
sired results in the way of a deeper i
channer. Parts of the work, such as
terminal piers, etc., may require some I
time for completion, but it is an en- i
couraging feature of the plan that the
main object, a reliable outlet, will be I
achieved, if at all, in a much shorter i
time than by any other system. That
being secured, so that vessels can (
pass in and out, the finishing touches
may be put on at leisure and without
obstructing commerce.
The manner of constructing jetties
is among the simplest of all engineer- t
ing works. The material and plan i
at the South Pass will be very near
ly the same as those used in the river
Maas, in Holand. The materials will (
be willows and stone, with scarcely I
anything else. The willows are bound
in long bundles, nine to twelve inches 1
in diameter, and these are called fas
cines. Other material than willows c
could be used, provided the branches I
are long,'lender and tough, with few (
leaves and ne lateral branches. They I
must pack close together and yet not I
be rigid. Of these fascines, large I
rafts or matrasses are constructed at
the place where the twigs are cut, and I
floated down to the mouth. After 1
being towed to the spot where they I
are loaded with broken stone and g
sunk. The lower raft or mattress I
must of course be the widest, each
succeeding layer narrowing toward I
the top. The work will thus he com
' posed of alternate strata of fasciues '
and stone. The sides of the work 1
thus formed would be a series of t
steps, but these will be covered and I
the incline made uniform by broken I
stone or rip-rap dumped in. To be i
short, jetties are nothing mere nor t
less than levees raised to confine the J
channel; the only difference is that
being under water they most be of
such materials as will withstand t
the wash of the water. The work 4
will nearly all be in very shallow
water, and eat of the channel, and I
the sinking of a mattress of fascines (
in such a place is avery simple affair.
Sinking these rafts and dumping
stone in shallow water along a line
of guiding piles is about all there is
of the practical engineerinlg problem. I
The magnitude of the work consists I
in the immense quantities of materials
to be used and the distance they most
be transported.
I
We do not think it proper for
any newspaper to say aught
against religious denominations,
I but when they carry their acts to
extremes, something must be done
to check it. The Baptist (colored)
church here has been reported to
us by all the citizens living in its
vicinity, as being almost a nnis
ance; the night meetings being
complained of, which are kept up
until two and three o'clock in the
morning, accompanied with a cho.
rus of howls that would put to
shame the most devout of dever
ishes! The matter has, time and
again, been referred to the Mayor,
f and he has been asked to inter
pose his authority and give the
people in the neighborhood some
r rest. Religious denominations have
perfect liberty in this country to
Sworship a' they see fit, but when
this worshi~is carried to the ex
Stent of disturbing a whole com
Smuit3y, thatt. community l . at
I least the right to complain, as we
do now for them.
The howls of the admistration or
' gans, when some honest republican
Sacomes South and gives his candid
f opinion of masters as they are, are
. fearful to contemplate.. Vice-Presi
Sdent Wilson, Judge Kelly, of Penn
sylvania, and nueroasu others come
Sin for a share of the 'slosh-bucket.
SWhen. such men as these are abused
. for "free speebch," we don't wondetat
I the amount and quality that has been

Origin of Exrinent Men.
Some of our newspapers are fond of ij
placing before the public the origin
of rich men. YWe thiink the poor ones
should have a chance; so we relate
ithe following brief facts for the en- or
i couragement of others : c1
John Smith was the son of his fath- in
er. lHe fornlrly resided in Stoke n
Pogis, and other places; but he has ar
moved to the penitentiary now. fie
William Smith was the son of his
mother. This party's grandmother ce
is deceased. She was a woman.
John Brown was the son of old se
Brown. Thoe body of the latter lies ti
mouldering in the grave. tip
Henry Jones was the son of a sea- tip
cook.
William Jones was the son of a gun. as
John Jones was the Son of Temn- n
perance.
In early life Gabricl Jones was ac
tually a shoemaker. He is a shoe
maker yet.
Previous to the age of eighty-five,
Caleb Jones had never given any si
evidence of extraordinary ability. He
has never given any since.
Patrick Murphy is said to have l
been of Irish extraction.
James Peterson was the son of a ui
common weaver, who was so miraca- at
lously poor, that his friends were en
couraged to believe that in case the ch
cricptures were -trictly carried out,
lie would "inherit the earth." He co
never get his property.
John Johnson was a blacksmith. I
he died. It was published in the I
papers, with a head over it, "Deaths."
It was, therefore, thought he died to e
gain notoriety. lie has got an aunt sli
living somewhere.
Up to the age of thirty-four, Hosesa w
Wilkerson never had any home but th
"Homd, Sweet Home," and even to
when he had that, he had to sing it ft
himself. At one time it was believed
that he would have been famous if
le had become celebrated. He died.
He was greatly esteemed for hisimany
virtues. There was not a dry eye in
the crowd when they buried him.

As an evidence of the closing of
the bloody chasm, we see that the 17
Secretary of War has withdrawn op- or
position to decorating the graves ofd
Confederates upon Decoration day. dr
This is as it should be, let us togeth- es
er visit the graves of our heroes, to '
strew fresh flowers over them, to drop i
the tear of sorrow, and testify there- X
by our appreciation of what they did o1
and suffered for us. No feeling of m
animosity should exist while we ný
mourn our dead; all sectional bitter
neus should be removed, and we each
should, with loving hands, deck with
sweet garlands of remembrance the tI:
heaving billow that marks the last tI
resting place of our heroes; better, ly
5 far better, than costly monuments t4
of marble, which minister to pride T
) alone, is this beautiful custom, these di
3 floral offerings, the humble, heartfelt ri
tribute to those who died in defence w
of their principles.

TIFF'S CLAIM. ti
Before the Superior District Court, o
on Tuesday, came Ip for trial the I1
case of Morenure vs. Du)uclet, where. it
in the former applied for a manda- 11
inmus to compel D)ubuclet to step down it
and out of the State Treasurer's of- tI
fice. a
First in order for trial were the ex- e(
ceptions filed by the members of the p
Returning Board and D)ubuclet himi- '
self, settingforth, as the chief grounds, i,
that the court was without jurisdic- a
tion in determining coqtested elec- N
tious.
The exceptions were maintained, I
and the case then coming up on its b
merits the Court refused the manda- v
mus and dismissed plaintiff's claim.

DEAR SIR .--Please ship us to Con. tl
shatta, care Abncy & Love, the barrel n
of insulators, two coilt wire, and the ai
spikes on storage at Grand Ecore.
We concluded not to open an office c
until we reached the river; our hands cl
are now 8 miles from Coushatta, so oi
that you see we will have the road
cleared and poles up through to Ceu
shatta, in a few days. We have been
considerably delayed on account of 01
so much dead timber to clean up. It gi
would not do to let this go undone.
If we did, the line would get down too
often. Please also advise me of the
exact distance to Alexandria; the "
shortest and best route to extend the P1
line from Natchitoches down. We fe
want to make arrangements to extend w
the line as soon as possible, and is T
there any points we could open an of
fice between the two places. We an
ticipate rtaching Natchitoches by the si
15th of June.
Yours Truly,
J. L. BUCHANAN. 81

F DAR SIR :-Your favor of May N
s 17th, just to hand. In reply, I have t(
.ordered the materials on store at w
r Grand Ecore to be shipped as request- to
ed. As to the best route to Alexan
. dria, I have ascertained that the short- PI
eat and best route for you to follow
would be the beaten road. I can
give yen more information, however, ai
' by a personal interview with you or
- Mr. Davis. I will also add that in my
I opinion, Cloutlervillo would be the d
f most desirable point for your compa
ny to open an office.
Very Respectfully,
R. W. .TAYLOR. 14
Judging from the average tone of p
the northern press, we mean of course, a
t the Radieal press, they have sudden- d
Sly discovered what we. all along con
B tended, that we were a loyal people. a
a The conduct of Louisiana last year t
, did more to convince them that the '
t restiveness of the whites of the South
. was not caused by a desire to enter a
into a second rebellion, but from the '
rule of thieving whites and ignorant t
negroes. We agree fully with the
Shreveport f7mec, that the Southern a
people are more loyal to the flag and r
government, than those blatant deme- a
gogues of the North, and time will
prove the correctness of the asser- i
tion. I
r We learn from the New Orleans i
Times of the 19tb, that the Custonim
! House crowd is commencing already I
d to prepare for the coming campaign.
. Caucuses are held daily in Packard's t
and Casey's offices and every offort
will be put forward to secure the
t State for the "truly toil.n "
We think their efforts are fruitless I
e -the reign of the thieves, liars and I
d sconundrels, of which the- radical par
Sty is composed, is fast .drawing to a
-cloe, and, 'unless our people make i
,ai or madmea' of tllma elv2'the
d neot election will result in their total
dideemature.-Shreveport Timens. :'
Some little stir is manifested in
this section, but we understand that
b although the colore4 men "got the
o w6rd" as in th formet haleyon days
0 9f radicalism, but they heeded not,
'a nor did they coine. The "bugle blast"
f days of thieves and robbers are.over,
I and no more to "their ringing sound"
d will the negro-rally. They .qgo lave
SI felt the weight of the incubas, mad
