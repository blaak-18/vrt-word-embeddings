MUWCIPAL LECTION. ' In'
The municipal ticxet published a s
in this issue is the one which was ma
fairly and regularly nominated at at'
the late Democratic mass meeting. pr
The ticket is a good one, and the noi
people of the town can safely trust his
their interests to its keeping. It cla
has the advantage also, of being rec
responsible to, and owing allegiance agi
only to the people, and proposes to crc
Srun the affairs of the town on busi- suf
ness principles. Every good Dem- So,
ocrat will be expected to go to the cha
poll' next Monday and vote the of
Democratic ticket without a scratch. up
We must be on the alert, and if ma
an opposition ticket should make im
its appearance, be prepared to snow sia
it under with Democratic votes. ha
Spain at last has agreed to make as
full reparation to the United States me
for the firing upon the Alliancia by
a Spanish man of war.
Dis
One of the greatest disasters of ha.
*recent times was the breaking of the get
3Bonrzey dyke near Espinal, France, an4
by which over x5o lives were lost, s'
and millions of dollars of damages to
done to property. Al
Some newspapers are clamoring St'
for a Southern man for president. 14
We will be satisfied with a good
democrat from any section except No
the East. The country has had
enough of Wall street for awhile. C'

The Queen city of North Louis- $2
iana seems to be getting a conside- arc
rable move on her. With two or Ph
three railroads knocking for en- fo
trance and a big immigration move
ment, Shreveport is about to a,
wake up and make some noise in the tO
world.
Owing to the scarcity of fat beef ti,
cattle, beef has risen very much in c
price, but the winter crop of hogs, ar
fortunately, is large; so that though I
beef may be beyond the reach of h:
some, yet hog product will be cheap t
enough to fit everyone's pocket. in

The State department is making
careful inquiries in regard to the
treatment of Ex-Consul Waller, who O
has been imprisoned by the French P
government, and his large conces- li
sion by the Madagascar govern
ment, confiscated.
The reports published concerning f
the Cuban rebellion are very con- ti
tradictory, but it seems now that f
Cuban independence is likely to be
postponed for some years yet.
Spain is taking very active steps to ,
suppress the rebellion and will most
likely succeed in a short time.
Ths Opelousas Courier suggests
that at the Donaldsonville meeting I
the newspaper men inaugurate a
movement to erect a monument
over the remains of the late
Capt. George W. McCranie,

at one time editor of the Ouachita
Telegraph.
The friends of free silver will
meet May ad at Miemphis for the
purpose of calling a convention in
opposition to the "sound money"
convention to be held there. Some

United States will defend the white

proceedings of both conventions
- will, be published.

It is England's boast~that thhsn -l

yet what profit is it to the masses of It
the people whose toil furnishes the man

hundreds of thousand of her poor ther

India, Africa-in every portion of And

gain and pride of conquest, has in not
no wise improved their condition. and
They have no hoarded millions as po
the fruit of plunder; their's not the trult
privilege of ",operating" in Lombard will
street. The school book tells us toth
that ",millions died that Caesar fuIt

equal truth, be said of England. drip
In passing it might be well to note o
a startling inconsistency of this old des
mother of ours. With all this blood But

practiced upon helpless savages- you,
not supassed by that of Cortez and tent
his mailed followers upon the half- to a

crocodile tears over the alleged nest

South; has the cool effrontery to do
charge our people with the practice shat
of unprovoked and needless cruelty
upon them. Of recent years Ger
many and France have seen fit to the

Three or four men have conspired to se-me
cure a practical monopoly of this country's tio
meat supply. These men are worth from
- , 5,ooo.ooo to $$o,0oOO,OOo apiece but they o
are not content. By virtue of their mono- ag
p oly they are at this moment making all
the people in the nation pay them two prices m
for every pound of meat they eat.
Another small group of men have secured
o a monopoly of the mineral-oil supply. They bu
too are multi-millionaires of insatiable greed. ha
They are at this moment compelling every
body in the country to pay from two to three d,
f times as much for light as they should. a
Another small group of conspirators have
control of the anthracite-coal supply. They no
are levying blackmail upon the people in sa
precisely the same way. m.
Another small group of multi-millionaires wl
f have coptrol of sugar, and are intrenched in so
their monopoly by laws purchased in the mi
P Senate of the United States. They are tax- to
ing everybody in the country to add to their w
already preposterous wealth. ha
g These are merely samples. The list might
be extended almost indefir.itely. Almost
e every article of common use is in the grasp T
0 of one of these monopolies. The taxes the
:h people are compelled to pay to these con
spiracies exceed by twentyfold the half bil
s- lion a year which they must contribute to
the support of the Government. E
What are we going to do about it?
We have compelled Congress to enact laws v
for the punishment of the conspirators and
for the restraint of their conspiracies. But
the administration which was in power when f
- these laws were enacted utterly failed to en
at force them. Its alliance with the conspirat
ors was open and flagrant, and the purchase-. a
Sprice of it was a campaign contribution.
t We elected a new administration pledged
by every possible promise to execute these e
to laws and a Congress pledged to enact more
st stringent laws if necessary. The Congress
did its duty in part. The administration be- 1
trayed the people utterly, and again the price
was a campaign contribution. It ut a trust
ts attorney in the Attorney-General's office. i
ng He seized the opportunity to discredit the
anti.monopoly laws in his first officral report,
a and-even to deny the authority of Congress s
nt to pass any laws at all against trusts and mo
nopolies. Such pretenses as he made of efforts
te to enforce these laws have been transparent I
ie, shams, designated solely to disciedit the law
and prevent its enforcement.
he The President, though elected in part on
nd this issue, and though specially and person
ally pledged to carry out the declarations of
ita the platform, has steadfastly refused to re
move the Whiskey Trust's attorney from the
law department or in any other way to res
ill pond to the popular desire for relief from the
intolerable trust oppression.
he Now what are we going to do about it?

It is simply the promise of a man or wo- the
man to abstain from all intoxicating liquors, Cour
and, like any promise, to. make it good, any
requires an honest intention and the ability meal
to keep it. It is naturally expected that any nor
one will be able to keep such a promise. O
"Of curse I can keep it," says the victim the
of drink, and he fully believes that he can, publ
but the results ofobservation and experience not
have proven that we must not be too sure; C
there has too often been failure in spite of
the best intention on the part of those who days
have signed the pledge, to allow us to in-n
dulge in confidence in the ability of man suit
alone. Men do not like to believe this of Atd
themselves, and so this leaflet may come in- At
to the hands of some man who is just such a the
slaveswho has broken pledge after pledge. hwit
And yet there is hope. with
In the affairs of this world, if the promise whfl
of one man is not broad enough and strong foll
enough to meet the requirement, if he has tin
not enough in his own person, he begins to Ne
look about for "backing," for indorsement; dred
and if he can get a "good name on his dept
paper" he is all right. He may not own a
dollar; he may have been even proven un I
truthful, careless about his promise; but he Iba
will be accepted in biusiness circles to the ex- Har
tent of the "backing" he can get. Take ing
notice, however, the dishonest and untruth- Bla
ful do not get indorsement. So in this mat
ter. You have a certain strength in your ofA
own will, bat the power of the appetite for
drink, and of the open saloon, are against
you, and if you could not get the backing of H. (
God Almighty, your case would surely be F
desperate, for your soul knows better than 1
to trust the word of your demoralized flesh. of A
But Jesus Christ has taken into account all
your need, the need of your home, wife and
children, of your own soul, and will indorse
you, poor bankrupt that you are, to the ex
tent of all you lack, provided you will be Bi
true in your part, and with a sincere purpose brid
to do the best you can, trust Him.a Your long
part is not to go in the way of sinners; not on t
cross the door of a place where liquor is egi
sold or drunk; not put out your hand to take bll
a drink; not stand and look at it; but to brid
cleanse your lips of profanity and unclean- de C
ness, and be willing to let the Holy Spirit of be r
God, and His people, do their work in you. 14t1
Do the best you can for God, and He will acct
do the best He can for you. "My God
shall supply all your need acc',rding to His
riches in glory by Christ Jesus." -
Keeping Away From A Foe.
Reading such proofs as the following of and
the dangerous and compelling power of the and
drink appetite, we can understand the temp- hun
tation of those who yield to it, while we Yot
condemn their folly in forging their own en- bef'
slaving chains. But for those who resist it
we can hardly speak too high praise. Mr.
John B- (ough, remarking that there is no and
cowardice in running away from the char- andil
ing of the alcoholic serpent, tells the follow- fin
ing anecdote by way of example: Lai
I know a man who was strongly tempted,
and escaped. He was a printer, and work
ing near a window opposite which was the
"Shades," he saw persons coming out wip
ing their lips, having taken their '-eleven liv
o'clock."
He began to want it, and grew nervous;
the desire increased; every fibre of his sys- n
tem seemed to cry out for it, when he
dropped his form of type, and, in his vexa- p
tion at the accident, took off his apron, put
on his coat, with the intention of getting the
drunk; when as he said, he thought of wife
and children, of -former ruin and disgrace, bi
and present prosperity and r.:putation, he La
rushed out and ran hatless through the as
streets till he reached home.
"Wife, shut me up, for mercy's sake, shut
me up and don't let me out. Ask no ques
tions, but shut me up." be
She was a wise wife and locked him in a
room, and there he remained for thirty
hours before he dare venture out to his work be
again.
A lawyer who had been intemperate told by
me, '-1 have been obliged to forego all light
literature. I can hardly read a newspaper." 1t
"Why"? I replied. Sr
"I have not tasted drink for two years, O0
y but if I only read of drinking, I want it. I M1
have paced my office with hands clenched Si
and the sweat standing in bends on my fore
head, as I battled the horrible desire to get m
e drink, when I have read of a man drinking gi
a glass of wine." fo
e Another gentlemen told me that he had
y not drank for twenty-cight years; "'But,"
a said he, "I have some fifty men working for
me, and when I take the breath of a man
5 who has been drinking, 1 want it-yes,
n sometimes want it so that I have ridden ten
e miles to rid myself of the desire that seemed ai
c- to cry through my whole system, Give! give! o
it when I have taken the breath of a man who w
had been drinking."-New York Advocate. Jg
