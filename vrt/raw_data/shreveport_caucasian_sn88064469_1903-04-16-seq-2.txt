All Hope of Repairing lhe Flymelia
Break About Abandoned.
CURRENT IS TERRIFIC
Water Sweeps Through the Broken
Ends of the Cribbing-, Undermin.
ing the Light Pilinv of
Several Days' Work.
New Orleans, April 10.-Hope of
closing the Hymelia -revasse has beer
practically abandoned Thursday th:
Senator Brady and those who have
been associated with him. All day a
terrific current swept around the br:
en ends'-of the cribbing and throt0
the great 700 foot gap ln the levecs
undermining' the light piling which v
had taken thirteen days and nights
build. Early in the forenoon it became
evident that any effort to build fresh
cribbing to join the ends would be
futile and every energy was directe
to protecting what was left. Consid
erable success attended these efforts
and the sacking of other portions, of
the cribbing was continued, but It was
generally understood that compleso
surre ler would be made to the river
if the experiment of driving sea wail
piling across the break in the cribbing
fails. A delegation from the crevasse
came to the eltypand made purchase of
this piling. it is considered, however.
that not a chancy in a thousand tr
close the crevasse remains. The levee
board has practically reached the en '
of its resources and planters are pull
ing away their hands in order to
build protection levees about their
places. It -will arobably be several
weeks before the crevasse ceases to
run.
The weather bureau expresses the
belief that high water will continue in
the lower Mississippi for three weeks
or longer though there will be but
slight changes in the next few days.
The break, above the mouth' of the
Red river have caused a delay in. the
*movement of the Mi.fsissippi flood and

an hour. twice the usual velocity of the
stream.
That the efforts to confine the waters
of this mighty river withip its banks
are not always successful is evidt'nceil
by the widespread devastations which
have resulted from the floods of this
and previous years. While the stress
upon the controlling barriers is only
felt in the flood season, when the Mis
sissippis normal waters are augmept
ed a hundredfold by the spring fresh
ets of its nuxuerous tributaries, the ut
most fcare and almost ceaseless labor
are required all the year around to keep
tlese barriers In repalir against, the
time when the snow and ice impris
oned waters of the farther north are
let loose by the returning sun and come
rushing madly down tpward the sea in
e wild, relentless and resistless torrent.
From Calro to the gulf the MIsissip
p1 flows through a flat land generally
at a mean level above that of the sui
rounding country. Along the left of
east bank there are bluffs here and
Lbere, with lowlands between that
have to be protected, but on the west
side of the river the land lies low and
it places really falls away, so that you
have to go uphill to get to the river.
Originally the Mississippi formed ita
)wn banks with mud which it washed
ap and deposited and wasn't at all par
Icular where those banks wes'e, cang
ag them at will to suit its fancy. The .*
aboriginal dwellers in the valley didn't
ninad this much, since they could push
Cheir canoes across the stream at one
lace as well as another, and it wasn't
rery important anyway whether he
lot across or not. Nor was it material t
:o the red man whether one section of
he valley or another or the whole of it t
vas covered with water., But when
he white man began to settle in the .
lMississippi valley and cultivate. Its t
Jeep, rich, red, alluvial soil it speedily
)ecame apparent that something must
Oe done to keep the erratic and change
'I river within bounds. So for a cen
ury the building of levees has gone on
intil now earthworks have been
brown up against the spring invasion
if the waters all the way from Cairo
o the delta, a distance of about 1,500
lifes.
The levees have been built partly by
he federal government, partly by the
abutting states, but chiefly by the plan
atton owners adjacent to the river,
rho formed levee districts, with boards
anpowered to levy taxes for the work
if construction and maintenance. With
a the main levees are often private
evees constructed by plantation own
rs or by towns, anul sometimes one
rill find places which resemble a for
ress, with a series of earthworks. P
It is difficult to estimate the cost of U
be Mississippi levees by reason of the u
act that the work- has been done by so k
many ifferent interests and paid for v
ut of sq many different funds. -Some a
en years ago it was estimated by gov. g
enment enginpeers that the lowlands ti
oild be protected from the delta to ij
lafro at a cost of > G,OOO,000 for con
truetion and 2,000,000 a year for
baint unce. Between these points s
here are 1,775 miles of levees. The a
fvees are snow controlled and policed V

Naturally every planter would rather jC
see a break occur below than awo e C
him. If it occurs below, his river r
frontage is at onu t relieved of til P
pressurfa e of tb i water, and if his levy1 d
happens to lie weak in any spot ti Ii
may he saved by a break below ani i11
not only his plantation, but the lives ,e
of himself and the members of his
family, be preserved. This is the sour;" '
of temptation in limes of stress that
makes men sometimes so far forget
themselves as to cause a levee to lot'
undermined. n
Another soou re of danger comes
from the lumbermen In the swamnlP
back of. the ievee. It is manifestly
cheaper for thwm to float their timber
out than to haul it. Hence they profit
,by a, flood.
During the Beeson of high water tie

who cannot give a satisfactory ancouit
of his purpose is permitted to uj

the levee or is caught in the act of
damaging It. he is promptly shot anmO
tried afterward.
A guard patrolling the levee notice
a slight l akage on the Inner side of
the embankment. The crown of the
levee "sounds" beneath his feet. Pres
ently a small stream spurts from the
Inner wail. He knows the sign. The
crawfish have undermined the levee
and one has worked through, makin,
a small tunnel scarcely an inch in 'Ii

of the embankment. in a Case like this
expediency Is the thing. Quick work
-may save the levee. An hour's neglect
may result in a crevasse, through
which the Mississippi will pour in 9
raging torrent.
The rapidity with which a break in
the levee becomes a crevasse Is one of
the terrible features of a Mississipp
flood. When the guard has discover"
that a crawfish has bored through t"
levee, he first sees a spurt of water
such as comes from a leak in a fir"
