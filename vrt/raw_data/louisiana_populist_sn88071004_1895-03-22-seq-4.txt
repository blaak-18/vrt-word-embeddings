My dear hu.Icklelrries, you all
voted for me, didn't you: We all
belon, to the same church. I'm a
Democrat, I can prove it by over
5,(100,(000 men who voted for me.
I was three times the nominee of
the party and tNwice elected. This
forever puts to rest any toulbt as
to my being a I)emocrat. There
fore what I say I say byy authority.
Listen to me. Notice well the words
of our text. T'Ihere has Ixwbn some
kicking against my administration.
But all along it has been right in
line with our text. "'For whom
soever hath, to him shall he given."
Havemeyer had the sugar trust.
We gave a chance to make money
out of it. This, my dear clod
hoppers, is in accordance with the
text. What are you kicking about :
The National hanker haul some
bonds. We gave him some more.
He has gold; we are giving him
mo:e. He has gold; we are giving
him more gold every day. 'I'o
him that hath shah he given. See?
I had something. I get more.
This has been a great administra
tion "for whomsoever hath." The
men who bought the last issue of
bonds had the money. They made
two million dollars on the transac
tion. By my refusing to sign the
tariff bill tho sugar and whisky
trusts were enabled to make mnil
Lions of dollars by the delay in it
becoming a law. You see to him
that hath shall he given. But to
proceed with our text; but whom
soever hath not, "from him shall
be taken awr y even that he hath."
That part the text, my sweet
scented res ,r earriers, applies to
you. I mean you fellows who have
to work for a living. You have
nothing to speak of, and hence
have to work for what you get.
Goed has blessed you with health
and a good appetite. You have
no wealth to burden your minds
and disturb your peaceful slumbers
-that is, most of you have not.
You that have, according to the
text, it is our duty to take it away
from you. "Whomsoever hath
not, from him shall be taken even
that he hath" Certainly. For
that purpose we got up the panic.
For that purpose we issued the
bonds. Mark how beautifully that
bond issue fit into the words of
our text. "For whosoever hath,
(the banker,) to him shall be giv
en, (bonds,) and he shall have more
abundance, (bank notes,) but whom
soever hath not, (the people,) from
him shall be taken away even that
he hath," (through interest on
bonds). It is a great scheme, and
you all voted for it, and still in
dorm it, because you stay in the
party. Mr dear, darling green
horns, we thank our stars for the
ampliity of your faith and youer
nanswerving obedience. The Hin
doo mother has been known to
scrioe one ch'ild nder the wheels
o JaggePrnant, but when it came
to the second one she would stop
to argue thecase. Your fath is
more sublime. To eaoorm to the
words and meaning of our text
aany of you have shown a wiliag
aes to amacre your whole fami
lies. Us "that hath" rejoice at the
mblinIty of your faith and will
-eatribta liberally to buy sounp
for you. Reseember that in gir
ing up walt yu ha.ve you are
abiding by the woeds pf our text.

Oh how wretched are they
Who their party olbey,
And have voted for Cleveland before,
Tongue can never express
Our contempt for Congress
But n xt year we will do it somo more.
Oh what comfirt we take
In believing a fake
And supporting a party that lies,
Though at first we believed
Now we know we're deceived
Yet for party we'll give up our lives.
'Tis so sweet here below
Grover Cleveland to know
And carry tin roosters in our hat.
We will fall at his feet
And oar vote We'll repeat
And try to keep the party at the bat.
We will work all c'ay long
And this shall he our song
We will always vote the ticket straight.
Our cotton we will sell,
If it sends us to hell,
For fonur cents less commissiou and freight
Then go on with the dlance
Though there's holes in our pants
And our children are crying for bread.
To them that hqth we'll give
Though othess cannot live
Arlistocratic robbers must be fed,
We'll give them what we've got
For you know 'tis our lot
We had no business to be poor.
The Scripture says its right
And we guess its out o' sight
J~oat give 'em all you gd5 and no more.
-National Reformer.
When "Gen." Warner, presi
ent of the so -aled lbmetallic
league, whoever he is, proclaims
his belief that the country cannot
except free silver coinage through
the people's party, and that the
oranization of a fourth party on
that issue is necessary, his talk
simply serves to cali attention to
the fact that he is merely the sala
ried motuth-peece of the specie-ba
ais silver owners, and a general
without an army. The eountry
has been hearing a great deal from
Mr. Warner of hate, and it
wouldd't hurt his standing a bit if
he were to cork himelf.--ow
