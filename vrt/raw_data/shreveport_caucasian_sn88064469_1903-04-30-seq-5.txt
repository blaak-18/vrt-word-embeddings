THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.
Optimism, Ambition and Iadustr F
Keep the Young Folks Young.
Few of us wear the same garments
continuously-the modern tendency is
said to be rather to the other extreme
and It is natural that the cape of good f
hope should not be always on our shoul
ders. Apparently there is not a sul r
dent number of these garments to g
round. for optimism never affects all
the world at the same time. Even in
a household it is sometimes found that t
when mother is cheerful father Invari
ably retires into gloom.
But if everybody were always bright
and hopeless these characteristics I
would no longer he looked upon as es
timiable. and the conclusion one comes
to is that, considering the hurry. the
world was made nearly as well ase
oursclves could have made it. One of
Mr. Barrio's characters remarks that
an optimist is a lazy man. Certainly
against the man who fusses abouW
prophesying disaster the charge of in
dolence cannot. unfortunately, he
brought.
The pessimist gets a great reputation.
because if .his dismal forebodings are
not realized in fact no one feels in
clined to blame him, and if by chance
they do occur he takes every means of
proclaiming his amazing powers of
foresight. The prophets of the world
only need doggedness and longevity.
and the law of chances makes it likely
that they will be right some day. Thus
it is that a name is earned for indus
try. As a matter of fact, most men s
lect the role which is the easiest fr
them to play.
Ambition so often goes hand in hand
with hopefulness that the optimist can
not be fairly charged with slothfulness.
No man would waste time in dreaming
dreams if he thought it were quite im
possible they should ever come true.
Young men studying industriously re
mind themselves that they "may be
president some day." The statement
that itls love that makes the world go
round 'as been proved by scientific
men to be-fallacious. They would have
more difficulty in contesting the argu
ment that it is hope that - makes the
world go on.
Bachelors are notorious experts (in
their own opinion) on the bringing up
of children. and that is why I dare to
suggest that youngsters should always
be allowed to be enthusiastic about
something. Unless they acquire the
habit in early youth they will never
get it later on, and the grownup per
son without enthusiasm is so useless as
to be deserving of scorn. By learning
to ride a hobby well in the days of
t youth children are preparing them
' selves for the more Important steeple
chases later on. It comes in the scheme
n of training which they have to under
0 go. But keep them young, all the same.

The pedestrian on the pui'eni t d 'en t'
see it, but the whole wall on which thell
picture is being painted is laid off into 1
a number of squares, made by inter- f
secting chalk lines. The exact spot in
each of these lines where the tip of the
nose or the toe of the foot shall be is
as fixed as is the day for the next
eclipse of the sun.
A visitor asked the head designer in
an outdoor advertising firm if it wasntt I 1
hard to get men skillful enough to
paint these exaggerated pictures.
"The other day," replied the design
er, "I got a man who had never painted
anything but letters in his life to put
a face twenty feet high on a wall, and
he did it as well as it could he done."
Then he showed how the only part
that took any skill was done in his
own office. First he or some other de
signer drew a small picture, about
quarter life size, on a piece of square
cardboard. When this was done, the
piece of cardbard was divided by pen
cil lines into sixty-four squares, so that
Its form was just like that of a checker
board. This was given to a painter,
and it was told him that each square
on the paper meant one fifteen feet
square on the wall.
Then it was easy tor the painter to
lay off with colored chalk squares of
the required size on the wall. When
be began to paint, he took the design
er's drawing with him. There were
explicit directions as to colors and the
kinds of brushes to be used. Then It
was only a matter of proportion. ' If
the nose occupied half a square on the
paper, It occupied half the correspond
ing square on the wall, and if the but
ton of the coat was at the intersection
of two pencil lines, it must be at the
same intersection of the chalk lines.
The designer said that it was a very
common occurrence for him to send
one man to finish a picture th4S an
other man had begun. Once he had
three men painting the same figure.
taking turn about until the job was
complete.
"It's purely anechanical," de said. "if
we catch a man using his own ideas or
trying to display any originality, we
get rid of him immediately. Suppose
a man took a notion into his head to
try a few fancy strokes and we had to
put another man at it the next day.
Wouldn't that picture be a pretty
mess?"
The average painter of large pictures
earns about $30 a week. A larger sal
ary is very rare. It is never hard to
get the man you want, the designer
says. because anybody that Is used to
a paint brush and can make measure
I ments is able to do the work.
Facts About the Bible.

British museum catalogue contain noth

the Bible and commentaries upon it.

are similar societies in other cities and
countries, and many private firms have
printed Bibles for commercial profit.
But for the work of these societies
we might never dream that more than
363 languages or dialects are spoken
and read in the world. The London
society alone has used that number.
Only about one-third of all 'the Bibles
printed in London are in English. In
