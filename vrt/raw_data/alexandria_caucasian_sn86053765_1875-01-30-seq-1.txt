"HIE nnnniinous and unsolicited verdict
of the hunilreds of thousands of read
ers of the TRH1UNE is, that the paper
was never so good as at the present
time During the jiast year it has enlarg
ed its field and improved its facilities in
every direction, and enters upon the clos
ing mouths of 1H74 with most, encourag
ing prospects. THE TEII'UNE, however,
believes iu deeds rather than in words—in
results rather than in promises. It. points
to its records and its columns for the past
twelve months as the best evidence of
what it has done, and the most satisfacto
ry pledge of what it will do. All the dis
tinctive features of the paper will be pre
served and strengthened ; ihe "Extras'
whose sale has readied hundreds cf thou

admitted pre-eminence of the paper not
