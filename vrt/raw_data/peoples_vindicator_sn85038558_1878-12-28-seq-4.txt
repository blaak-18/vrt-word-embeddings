THE WOR LD
FOR 1879.
SPECIAL OFFER.
THE NEW YORK
WEEKLY WORLD,
An Eight-Page Newspaper,
will beseut (posfage perpaid)
Fr .n. ow tntil January 1, 1S79
FOR
TEN CENTS.
-'This Special Offer is made to enable the
Soutiherni people to see fur themselves how good
a paper THE WORLD is and how worthy it is
of their sudport.
On the lat of May, te1r, the ownership and
controle of THE WORLD passed into the hands
of the undersignted, under whose absolute and
untrammelled directwons THIE WORLD has
ever since renailredl anl niow remains
During the whole of this time TIlE WORLD
has labored patienutly and perseveriugly for the
accomplishment of two objects in politics of
paramount interest to the Southern people
I. The restoratiotn of Local Self-Government
at the South.
II. A Real Reform of the Civil Service, in
such wise as to destroy the political machines
under the opperation o which it has come to
pass that the people are taxeo to snpport politi
cal parties, whetras political parties have no
other reason of being except to lessen the bur
den on the governmellnt.
The tirst of these objects have been triumph.
antly accomplished. A'l inteligent Northen
luen now adtitit that all parts of the colntruty
were as deeply interested as the South in seeing
it won. A corrupt sid antit lDemcratic govern.
meat in the Soudth was a p)erllanent peril to the
ascendancy of true Amlerican principles in the
Federal Governmnent and therefore t, 'h' pt,. *,.
on.td huiut or Lhe hole people.
The second political object for which TIlE
WORLI) oontouds still remailns to be fully ach
ieved. The actual Administration began its
career with excellent pronlises in this direc
tiol of which it is sulticient to say that they
have Iv-en as yet only in, part redeemed. THE'
W\ORLD tfor its part will resolutely support any
honest efforts to redeem these protuises fully,
by whosoever mtade, andt will as resolutely dte
diotnce every obstical thrown in the way of re
ldeeninug them, from whatever quarter
It seemns to the untdersigned eminently proper
that he slhould ask the co-operation of the best
menll of the Sioth n ith Tl'lE WORLD in its ef
rtt rryut o the itolicy here outlined. He
believes '1TIlE WORLD) to be a paper which
SollthiernI c'itizens anld Democrats call recolnl
ilenill to Southeru readers as an intluece worthy
and important to be brought to bear with cotn
stoutly increasing power uplon our national af
airs, int the interest of truth, of justice and of
arotsnv among our people of all sections.
It is my desire to keel) THE WORLD in a
lively relation with the best thoughts of the
South, to the endl that tile best ideas. wishes
and feeliigs of the Southern people may be
clearly arly i ly known to the North: the East
and the West. Alike in prtvato and in public
affairs the misunderstanding of men by one an
other liesat the root of so munch evil that the
word itself has come to be a synonym with
quarreling and strife. It was a wise saying of
Lord Elgin. at the time of on6 of our sharpest
idisputes with Great Britain, that two intelli
gent gentlemen alone on a raft in the Atlantic
with pletnary power could adjust the whole mat
ter honorably in an hour.
THILE WCILD simply asks its filionds at the
South to aidt it in ,bringing about a compleite
meeting of minds on all public questions be
tween the intelligent cit.izen of all part of the
Union, WILLfAM HENRY IIURLBERT.
