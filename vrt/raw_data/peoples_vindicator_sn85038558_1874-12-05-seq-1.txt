Seelye and Hodgson,
The result of the atrest and trial cf'
Deputy Marshal Seelye and L't. Hadg- c1
son, u:pon the order of Judge Tiimble, t
may be briefly summed up thus: See- .
lye, after remaining about seven days r
in jail for contempt of court, received a
a,,pardon from Kellogg. lie was
brought into court, whereupon J. II. s
Dinkgrave, Esq., exhibited the pardon r
as counsel and immediately, in his oth- I
er capacity as U. S. Marshal, arrested
Seelye for embezzlement, upon a
warrant front some comnmissioner sup
posed to hold his court in New Or- s
leans, at the same time calling for 1
aid from Capt. Head and the troops I
to enforce the warrant. Judge Trim- I
ble disregarding this palpable ruse in i
Seelye's behalf, remanded Seclye to i
the custody of the Sheriff, to await
the result of an indictment found by 1
the Grand Jury for cutting the tele
graph wires. Bond was fixed at $1000, e
which Seelye funished, and he was
then taken in charge, with two sol
diers as an escort, arrived in Monroe,
and, without delay, proceeded to
New Orleans, where we presunme the I
embezzlement will end in smoke.i
Tihe bond will, doubtless, be forfeited,
and Seelye will betake himself, like
a wise detectihe, to other lields.
In the case of L't. Hodgson, 'the i
Judge, upon application of several I
citizens, releasred the acused, after lie I
had been in prison about thirty-six l
hours. Upon trial for cutting the
wires, Hodgson plead guilty, and was
fined one dollar and costs. The Lieu
tenant was then placed under milita- I
ry arrest, and is now, awaiting trial
by court-martial, upon what specific
charges we have not heard.
And thus stands the case of Seelye
and Hodgson. As the latter is about
to undergo a military trial, we refrain
from any comment upon his acts ex=
cept to say that the army uniform
has not been elevated by his course.
As to Seelye, the "oscillator." we are
under restraint whether to denounce I
him for his tyranny and subserviency, I
or to pity him for his own cowardice,
flight and disaster. Between Seelye
and Hodgson, most outrageous acts
upon the rights of freemen have been
perpetrated, and evidently for parti
san purposes. The affidavits and
warrants upon ~hich they acted were
not only frivolous, but show a con
spiracy to intimidate white people,
which conspiracy is further proven
by the cruel and insulting manner, i
systematically carried out, in which
they arrested and treated helpless old
men under their charge. Savages in
war could have been but little less
like human beings in the treatment
of their prisoners.-Ouachita Tele
graph.
MAKING UP FOR A DEFICIENCY.
Judge Collins-so we will call him
a well-known, highly r e s p e c t e d
Knickerbocker, on the shady side of
fifty, widower, with five children,
full of fun and frolic, ever ready with
ajoke-to give or take-was banter
ed the other evening by a miss of five
and twenty for not taking another
wife. .She urged that lie was hale
and hearty and deserved a natrimo
ed the fact; admitted thlat he was
convinced by the eloquence of his
fidr friend that he bad thus far been
very remiss, and expressed contrition
for the fault confessed, einding with
offering himself to thie lady, telling
her she could not certainly reject
him after pointing out to him his
heinous offense. The lady replied
thlat she would be most happy to take
tihe situation so auniquely advertised,
and beoome bone of his bone and
flesh of his fleslh, but there was one,
to her, most serious obstacle.
"Well," says the Judge, "name it.
My profession is to surmouint such
inipediments."
"Alh, Judge, this is beyond your
powers. I have vowed if ever I marry
a widower he must have ten chil
s dren."
a "Ten children! Oh, that's nothing,"
says the Judge; "I'11 give you five
now and my notes on dei, and in in
stallments for the remainder."-New.

A ISLAxND ADRrF.--During the
fearful galeon Satur4ay night, an is.
land, two acres in extent, situated
in St. Louis 'Bay, one and a half
miles above MinnesotaPoint, was dis
placed and floated a distance of three
miles down into Duluth Bay, and
landed at Allen's ship yard. Upon
the island are pine trees that will
measure three feet acioid the stump,
and it is, thickly covered, over witlh
other timber. The soil op the island
is as solid as any on the mainland.
There are several islands in Daluth
and St. Louis Bays, but none have
heretofore been known to be displac
ed and to foat och a distance.-Chi
cago Tribuine.
SThe girls of Vissar College lay
foot ball--and many a young man
thereabouts wishes he were a foot
ball, especially as the girls sometimes
miss the ball and land on their heads
ib tlie grass. It must be an inepiring
sIht, too, to see the girls engaged in
this important study; and if they
were to charge fifty cents admission,
tie gate money would be more than
enhbgh to pay for their ednucatio.

An indiaii ii a Police Coui'tt
An Indian had been picked up
drunk, and though it was proposed to
to let him go over the river, it was gi
desirable to have him understand that in
no Indian has any more rights than di
a white man.
"Chield of the whispering forest, hi
son of the grassy paints, it grieves b,
my spirit to see you here," saud his
honor. "Only a few more moonsfe
will come and go before youl will beo'
gathered to the happy hunting grounds as
of your brothers gone before. You ti
are an aged tree. Time has shorn ol
you of your strength. You can no al
longer chase the wild cundurango and in
follow the roebuck. The buffalo grazes a
in front of your'lodge, and your arm In
is not strong enough to draw the bow. In

lightning make you afraid. Once thi

of your tribe, su many did they num

self, two old army blankets, and a G
shot gup with the lock out of repair. al
Son of the forest, why is this thing at
thus, and what do you mean by comr- if
ing into my trapping grounds and Il
getting drunk V"
"The white chief has spoken many a
wise words," replied the Indian in hl
measured tones, resting one foot on st
the edge of a spittoon. ; "My race has st
fillen like the leaves-been washed tI
away as water washes out the marks a'
of chalk. I stand alone. My camp si
fire has gone out, and my lodge is cold he
and has no mat. Kawnee-kekick e(
has tears in his eyes when he looks ft
to the. west and no longer sees the
smoke of many camp fires. Our.
great chieftains have fallen, our war- a
riors are dust, and the wolf utters his at
lonesome howl on the spot where it
stood our big village. I am sad." ei
"The red man may go," said his ri
Honor. "[ cannot give 'you back t(
your dead ; I cannot cover the hills nI
and mneadows, with forests again ; d
the wild fox and the deer have sought s"
the deeper glens, and no power can o

An Irishman, being recently on h
trial for some offense, pleaded "not d
guilty," and the jury being in the e
box, the district attorney proceeded f4
to call Mr. Furkisson as as a witness. h
With the utmost innocence Patrick C
turned his face to the judge and said, il
"Do I understand yer honor, that Mr. o
Furkisson is to be a witness against r
me? The judge said dryly, "It seems
so." "Well then yer' honor, I plade d
guilty sure, if yer honor plaise, not v
because I am guilty,, for am as inno
cent as yer honor's sucklin babe, but
jist on account of savin' Misther Fur
kisson's sowl."
"I did not come' here, geitlemen,,
with the intention of making a speech,
and am consequently wholy unpre. -
pared to do honor to the occasion. ti
You must, therefore, excuse me if 1 h
cnfilne myself to a few brief obser
vations." Such were his remarks as
they hoisted hint upon a table at a re
cent political meeting, and after lie
hIlad talked for an hour and three
quarters, it took three of hiis most a
able-bodied conistituents thlirteen min- I

BELAUTY Ot BRAINS.-lf it were op- I
.tional with all women to be intelli
gent or beautiful, but fortliduen,
to tlelti to be bth, which of two t
gifts, beauty or brains, would the t,
majority of the sex prefer ? This is at
delicate question ; but if ipt to the
vote we are inclined to think that b
beauty would carry the day. Mien e
bow down to feminine loveliness; but
as a irule they are apt to tight shy of
feminine wisdotm. Some of them
even seem to regard it with jealousy,
as an infringement on their preroga
tive. It is true that several tough a
old philosophers have inveighed
against the influence of beauty, stig- t
muatizing it as a "short-lived tyranny,"
a "silent fraud," a "mere accident of
nature," and the like ; but the pro
bability is that these caustic fellows
had made bids for it in vain, and that
the acidity of temper they displayed
was ascribable to "sour grapes."

a new story of Horace Greeley. ilor
ace wrote a note to a brother editor
iu New York, whose writing was
equally illegible with his own. The
recipient of the note not being able
to read it, sent it back by the same
messenger to Mr. Greeley for eluci- 1
dation. Supposing it to hbe the an
swer to his note, Mr. Greeley looked
over it, but likewise was unable to
read it, and said to the boy, "Go
take it back. What does the d-n
fool mean I" "Yes, sir," said the boy, I
"that is just what lie says."
Sundary night a policeman on Ba
ker street, Detroit, passing a certain
house about 10 o'clock, saw a man
drop from a window and heard smot-lt
ered cries inside. He seized the man
I for a burglar, but soon found that he
had the owner of the house in his
clutches. "Well," said the ollicer,
it looked suspicious to see you drop
out of a window that way. "Well,"
replied the man, heaving a 'sigh,
"when the old woman, gets her
dander up I ain't particular about
what road I take to get, out of the

How To KEEP SWEET PoTA"OEP:.
Many people who now have no pota
toes ehiring the winter, would Ihave
thein if they only knew how to keel)
themti. Tiley hlave tried and failed,
become disgusted and abandonled the
effort. A successful potato-raiser and
potato-keeper gave us the following
plan the other day. It is simple, iu
expensive and, lie says, etfectual :
Dig early in thlQ morning and con
tinue until as many have been dug
as -at be put away before ntight.
Allow them to dry in the sillU duling
the day, provideul the sun is not hot
enough to burn . them, which very
rarely is the case at potato-digging
time; then, on a piece of ground ieo
high that it will not become wet
during, the winter, lay a thick coat of
pine or other dry straw and build a
hiank of fifty or sixty bushels. Cor
er the bank with seven or eight in
ches of -straw and leave it to "sweat"
for two or three days, taking care to
protect it against rain. Thlien cover
tlhoioughly with earth sixteen or
eighteen inches ithick, doing this
work in the cool of the morning, be
fore the sun has warmed the earth or
the potatoes. Cover all. over, ex
eluding all air, and shelter complete
ly from rain. The reason for cover
ing in the cool of the morning is that
the soil used for covering is cool antd
will not heat the. potatoes, and that
the potatoes not being exposed to the
sun iare also cool, anidl being coolly
covered in this condition will not
subsequently heat and rot, having
gone through a. sweat before they
were covered with earth. Ohr in
formlant told us that he had practiced
this niethod for a numnber of years,
iand always dg' his potatoes when
they were tit, no matter how hot the
weather, and had never lost a potato
by rot, He added that all potato
houses are hunbugs. B.
How TO .ELEVATE THE FARMLt.-
A young man wlhi haIt resolved to de
vote himself to farming, fiAding him
self discouraged by what he believed
to be tht low rank assigned to the
"mere farmrner" as compared with the
members of other callings, recently
asked us to tell hint by what means
farhners can assume the rank, exert
the influence and receive the consid
eration to which, in view of the ser
vices they render to the well being of
the community, they seem to be en
titled.. We answered him; Parmers'
can elevate themselves to a level with
the loftiost and' most honored in the
State.
1. By improving their education
generally as well as professionally.
2. By using tlhe means which' sci
ence has pointedl out as the best for
the eultivation of the soil and its per
wnieiut imlirorvedheiit. -
'3. By, keeping oily the best breeds
,f. dlomnetic ,uuimals,,gad feeding and
earing for them in the best manner.
6. tlf the nese of.' ilie most approv
ed labor savhing' hýchihery, that' is,
substituting machinery) as lmuch as
possible for human,ltdbk,.
5. By raising those, crops which,
with refierenee to soil,mate, means
of transportation, markets, supply
and demand, promiose the greatest
amount of success and profit; and
6. By denmonstratihg to cultivated
t men, that farming is nan agreeable
i and enlightenimmg ocpupttion, and that
ithe farnmers' dwelling can be made
-the aHbode f t~ste, culture and refined
manners.
