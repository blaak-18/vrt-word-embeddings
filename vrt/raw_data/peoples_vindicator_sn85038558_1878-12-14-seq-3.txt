this gentle hint be all sufficient.

A MIuRDEnR.-One Sarah
a colored woman it is reported, has
murdered a white child eight or nine
years of age named Eaves, on the
Butler plantation on Red river. Our
reporter gathers the following facts
relative to the case :
This murdered child, with others,
was picking pecans when the woman
Sarah came to them and endeavored
I to take the pecans from the children.
In this endeavor she struck one of
the children over the head, three or
four blows, from which it died in a
few hours. District Attorney Hall
has ordered an autopsy of the body
of the child and the courts will move
in the prosecution of the person
charged with the crime. For that
reason we refrain from expressing an
opinion upon the facts narated.
The yellow fever commission, com
posed of the most eminent physicians
in the United States, have pronoun
ced that yellow fever is an imported
disease, and recommend non-inter
course with tropical ports from May
to November each year. Whereupon,
the "business interest" of New Or
leans are working like beaver to break
up quarantine entirely. WVe reiterate
f -New Orleans must submit to non
1 intercourse with West Inidian and
Souith American ports, as recem
mended by tile commission, or be
blockaded to her very doors by the
S"country people." The qustion is
the bannana trade or that of the inte
rior.
The total amount of city taxes col
lected to date of tile current revenue
is about $2,000 which includes quar
C antine tax, and licenses. The tax
- levee, licenses and qnarantine tax
Sampunts to $5850. We understand
that a number of tax payers are wait
Sing for the year to pass so that
Sthe new Board may pass an ordinance
I making old scrip receivable for taxes.
Such aln ordinance would be rank in
r justice to those who p y in currency
and violative of the spirit of the law
prohibiting the issue of scrip.
SPERSONAL.--Our whilom friend Dr.

e Something for the New Year.
The world renowned success of Hostet
ter's Bitters, and their continued popu.
e larity for a quarter of a century as a
p. stomachic, is scarcely more wonderful
than the welcolme that greets the annual
appearance of HIostetter's Almanac. This
h 'valubale medicine treatise is published
by Hostetter &" Smith, Pittsburg, Pa., un
der their own immediate supervision, em.
Y ploying 80 hands in that department.
t. Ten cylinder printing presses, 8 folding
machines, 5 job presses, &c., are running
about eleven months in the year on this
. work, and the issue of same for 1879 will
not be less than ten millions, printed in
Sthe English, German, French, Welsh,
o Norwegian, Swedish, Holland, Bohemian,
and Spanish languages. R1fer to a copy
of it for valnbale and interesting reading
Y concerning health, and numerous testi
a monials as t, the efficacy of Hostetter's
Bitters, amusement, varied information,
astronomical calculations and chronologi
e cal items, &c., which can be depended on
for correctness. The Almanac for 1879 can
obtained free of coat, from druggists and
V general country dealereia all parts of the
coUntry.
The VINDICATOR reporter espied a
M\yers--you all know Myers ?-among
the galaxy at the bar-in the Court
House,. His host of admirers-prin- ,
ciply waiting sentence-were evident- I
ly "joyed" over his return. His '
nunmetons friends - designated in
number by the "figger" 0-seem ap
pleht nsive that he will not meet that
enthusiastic reception when he faces
the awful twelve to wlhich lie is
entitled. We understand his bonds
men, knowing his weakness for corn
in a fluid state. had him shipped up
per steamer Texas C. O. D. Myers
is, so your reporter learned, full of
stories regarding yellow fever. The
Howard Association rooms are, how
ever, closed and there is no more
brands for the "little sick chiilren.'?
Hlornsby lie says, tried to boi row two
bits from him ; from this we are led
to believe that IHornsby will soon be
in the Lunatic Asylum.
BI'RGLARIZED.
Store Entered and Robbed.
NO ('CI'E TO TIlE ROBBERS,
The store of II. Sinon, Esq., on Wash
ington street, was entered by burglars on
Wednesday night and robbed of goods to
the extent of $400 or more.
Our reporter visited the premises on
Thursday morning, and Mr. Simon show
ed him the tools used by the robbers and
their mode of entrance. They effected an
entrance into the building through the
rear door, which was fastened by a heavy
store lock and secured by a cross-bar of
iron, from the outside, stapled and pad
locked with improved pattent padlock,
This lock was carried off, consequelntly it
is impossible to judge whether it was
broken or unlocked with false keys. The
door was then prised open with an iron
lever and the door lock broken.
The goods stolen consisted of clothing,
pants, vests, coats, drawers, shirts and
jeans; with a silver watch, ribbons, co
logue, &c.
The burglars must have been some
time at their work and were provided
with good tools, for they left on the
ground, cold chisels, drills, lever, &c.
This makes the second successful rob
bery of stores in the city during this
winter. Some steps should be taken to
ferret out the gang, for gang there cer
tainly is, and bring them to book.
We would suggest a reward be offered.
THE COTTON VALLEY.
Statement of Mr. Luchini.
Scenes and Incidents not brought to
light by Inspector's Examinations.
A LOUD DEMAND FOR JUDICIAL
COGNIZANCE.
Our Reporter learning of the arri
val of Mr. Luchini, who was a pas
senger on board the Cotton Valley at
the time of her wrecking, paid him a
visit and gleaned the following state
ment regarding the collission, and
subsequent lose of life:
Mr. Luchini states, that at 4 o'clock
in the morning hlie was awakened
from his sleep by a loud crashing
noise, something like the breaking of
timber; being an old "tar" lie was
satisfied that there was danger in
sight. He jumped out of bed and
opened both doors of his stateroom,
rushed out on the larboard side, and
saw the Charles Morgan near the
Cotton Valley. He leaned over and
saw that the guard about midship to
the stern of the Cotton Valley was all
torn off. Upon seeing this, he eqiop
ped himself with a life-preserver, put
on his pants and gathered up what
baggage he had in the room and went
up on the hurricane roQf. When on
the roof he saw the bow of the Mor
gan was lapping with that of the
Cotton Valley. A line was thrown
from the Morgan to the Cotton Val
ley, and, the deck hands instead of
making it fast to the ill-fated steam
er, made use of it to get aboard the
Morgan.
If the offic&rs of the Morgan had
lowered the stage plank to the roof
of the Valley, the passengers could
all have been saved, as they could
have walked aboard of the Morgan
without wetting their feet. The
Morgan was in possition to have done
this fully for five minutes.
At this moment Capt. Mark Kouns,
with his family and some others, took
the yawl and went ashore, and was
not seen again. He could not tell
whether Capt. Kouns had time to get
back before the steamer sank or not.
After Capt. Kouns left us, the steam
er commenced to sink gradually, the
bow going down and the stern rising.
There were 20 or 25 persons, to the
best of his recollection, standin on
the stern of the boat as the bow ras
going under, hollowing to the officers
of the Morgan to send the yawl. The
Morgan was than about 25 to 40 yards
from the wreck, with her bow up
stream toward the Cotton Valley.
They never sent the yawl or came
any nearer. From the time of the
collision to the time the steamer
sank was fully 20 minutes.
A lady and gentleman in their night
clothes were standing at the stern of
the boat, locked arms, and through
excitement were going to jump over
the wheel. Just as they were in the
act of doing so, Mr. Luchini placed
his hand on the gentleman and told
him, if they attempted that, they
would meet sure death. "The gen
tleman then said, "I see you have a
life-preserver, will you save my
1 wife V" He replied, "I will do all I
can, provided she will keep quiet and
I not get excited."
The occurrences from this time we
give in Mr. Luchini's own words.
I then told the lady to take hold of
Sthe life-preserver on my left side; she
Sdid as I advised her. Just as soon as
the water was ankle deep on
the hurricone roof, I started off
swimming with her, and her hus
band holding to her gown. I swam
as fast as I could toward the Morgan.
-At the stern of the Morgan hang a
Syawl about six inches above the wa
ter. I called for them to lower down
Sthe yawl, but no attention was paid
Sme. I heard , voice from the Morgan
seaying, "Go Ashore,!' and I swam
Sunder the yawl. I continued swim
miong down the river 3 or 400 yards,
and saw something floating oil the
water at a distance I immediately a
started for this object, when I came `I
upon it, I saw it was drv :ygods hox
es fltom the wreck, and told this gen
Ilenami and lady to I iake hold of one
,of tlhose boxJes; t holv tlook hold of t
on!e aii I took lhol f oi a trunk, and 11
the wind blew us ashore. I ,jndge i1
lie distance was abhout three miles It
'froii the wirecki. I led the laIdy to it
the wat ers iedge, anld heing cold and a
weak froti exhaustion, I was unable h
to go up the banlk witlh the hdily, I
saw a negro and called him to help 1
the lady up the bank, and I crawled
on up. After getting on the hank I
made an attempt to walk to the Mor
gan; being too weak, I fell four times
in a distance of abont 25 yards. I1
saw a negro and called hiim to assist
nie, which he did, and was helped
aboard of the Morgan. The lady and
gentleman I found on board. I took
at seat at the stove ; some gentleman I
offered meo a glass of whisky as a f
stimulant, but I was unable to raise I
my arm to take hold of the glass, and i
lie placed it to my mouth to drink, t
which I did. It was fully 20 or 25 C
minutes Ibefore I couldl make use of
iny arms or hands to take my shirt off t
to dry. After I had dried my clothes
a gentleman came to The with a pa
per; I read it. It was "A Card of
Thanks" to the ollicers of the Mor
gar for the kindness and assistance I
rendered the passengers of the ill- I
fated steamer. I told him I would
not sign it, as they had not sent the
yawl when called for, when they had
the opportunity and ample time to do
so; one gentleman remarked to me
that I ought to be ashamed of myself I
for refusing to sign the Card, after I
the officers of the Morgan had stop
ped their boat to take as all on
board to keep us from freezing to
death. I replied, "I will sign a Card
thanking the Captain for the kind
ness lie extended-that is, for the
breakfast and dinner, and the stove
to dry my clothes, but rot for saving
my lito or that of the passengers."
Mr. Luchini desires us to state
that lie thanks Mr. Beard, of Sum
merville, Kentucky, for coat, etc.,
to go ashore with.
Colored Methodist Collation.
The colored Methodists of our
city will give a Collation on Fri.
day and Saturday, 20th and 21st
of December, for the benefit of
their Pastor, Mr. Thompson. We
hope, nay we feel assured, that
our colored friends will be freely
supported by our people. This
Church under charge of Mr. Tomp
son has been what a Church should
be-a house for the worship ofGod,
and no encouragement should be
lacking on the part of the white
citizens to show their appreciation
of MIr. Thompson and his congre
gation, composed as it is, of many
of our best and most law-abiding
colored citizens. Tickets for the
Collation are for sale by the Com
mittees.

THE SUN FOR 1879.
Tas Suv will be published every day doul
the year to come. Its purpose and method will
be the same as in the past : To present all the
news in a readable shape, and to tell the truth
though the heavens fall.
The Sun has been, is. and will continue to be
independent of everybody and everything save
the Truth and its own convictions ofduty. That
is the only policy which an honest newspaper
need have. That is the policy which has wor
this newspaper the confidence and friendship ea ;
a wider constituency than was ever before en.
joved by any other American Journal.
The San is the newspaper for the people. It
is not for the rich man against the poor man, or
for the poor man against the rich man, but it
seeks to do equal justice to all interests In the
community. It is not the organ of any perso,;
class, sect or party. There need be no mistaer
about its loves and hates. It is for the houb
man against the rogues every time. It is for the
honest Democrat as against the dishonest e.P.
ublican, and for the honest Republican asmains
the dishonest Democrat. It dues not take its cae
from the utterance of any politician or political
organization. It gives its support unreservedly
when men or measures are in agreeance with
the Constitution and with the principals upon
which this Republic was founded for the people.
Whenever the Constitution and constitutlonal
principles are violated--as in the outrageea
conspiracy of 1876, by which a man net eleotel
was placed in the President's oftice, where he
still remains"it speeks out for the right. That is
The Sun's idea of independence. In this respect
there will be no change in the programme for '
The Sun has fairly earned the earty
of rascals, frauds, and humbugs of all
sizes. It hopes to deserve that hatre . ear
in the year 1879, than in 1878, 1877, o" O, th
gone by. The Sin will continue to
wicked with unmitigated brig uld be eoa.
While the lesson of the J.'he Sun dos
stantly kept before the '879 a magasine
no prepose to make it's ted for the mon san
ancient history. It.A concern is chlefly with
women of to-day: It has both the dispositiones
the affairs of tword its readers the promptest,
and abilisyjost accurate inteligence of what
fullist, 5e wide world is worth attention. To
ever ii the resources belonging to weli-estab.
thud prosperity will be liberally employed.
lithe present disjoined couditiou of parties it
this country, and the uncertainty of the future,
lends an extraordinary significance to the ovets
of the coming year. The discussions of the
press, the debates and acts of Congress, and the
movements of the leaders in every section of the
Republic will have a direct bearing on the Pres
idential election of 1880-au event which must
be regarded with the most anxious interest by
every patriotlic American, whatever his pollt
eal ideas or allegiance. To these elements of in.
ierests may be added the probability that the
Democracy will control both houses of Con
gress, the increasing feebleness of the frhadlsat
Administration, and the spread and strengthea
ing everywhere of a healthy abhorane of frfud
in any form. To present with accarsey ad
clearness the exact situation in each of its vary
lug phases, and to expound, accordin to fto
well.known methods, the principes thart shoma
guide as through the labyrinth, will be au I
portant part of The Sun's work for 1e7.
We have the means of making The Sun, as
political, a literary and a general anwspaper,
more entertaining and more useful than ever
before: and we mean to apply them freely.
