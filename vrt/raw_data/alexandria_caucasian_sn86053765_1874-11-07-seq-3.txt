Oun Visitobs .— -Early in the
morning 011 the day of the election
Capt. Snow, of Ozark fame, rode
into town with a troop of U. S.
Cavalry, and remained until late in
the evening 011 Tuesday. They
were not noticcd by anybody 011
election day any more than if they
had not been here, and must have
felt mighty chop-fallen, As intim
idators they were mighty poor
shakes ! They did'nt scare anybo
dy that we know of! TI10 result of
their coming was that the Radical
majority ot this precinct instead of
being 400 or 500, was only 188, and
right here too, where they came to
force them to voto tlio Radical
ticket. Bully Cavalry ! Come
again another time ! They were
the very best canvassers we could
possibly have had. O11 Tuesday
Capt. Snow inspected the Court
House, and was not at all pleased
with tho status of things in the Tax
Collector's Office. Our friend Mike
Legras, gave him some pretty plain
talk, which plainly meant that it
was none of his (Capt. Snow's) bus
iness, how he managed his office.
Then his mightiness, Capt. Snow,
wanted to know ot Kelso 11 what
sort of a hell of a crowd he had
down there anyhow ?" Oh, how
we don't intimidate !
