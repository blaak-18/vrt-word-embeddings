COOLIDGE UNAFFECTED BY
REBUKE IN SOUTH DAKOTA
One Faction Opposed to President Because He Failed to
Take Action in J)ismissing Attorney General Daugh
erty, C C. Chase and Others From Federal Service.
Democrat* in Capital Believe They Can Elect Any Man They Nomi

Party—Religious Question Comes l’p.
(Bureau of Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 27.—At the hour of writing this
story it looks as if the people of South Dakota had repudiated Pres
ident Coolidge and given their support to Senator Hiram Johnson in
the primary in that state. Many people regard this as a stem re
buke to the president, and is evidence that there is much discon
tent with the administration in that neck of the woods.
There seem to be two divergent
schools in South Dakota; one school
consists of the president’s friends and
•upporterrs and the other school
seems to think that the president has
made a mistake in not swinging the
meat axe long ago on fellows like
Attorney General Daugherty, A.B.
Fall, C. C. Chase, and others. This
school of thought is of the opinion
that President Coolidge should have
bunted around long ago and found the
big stick that “Teddy” had when he
was in the White House and proceed
ed to use it.
However, the president’s friends
claim that he thrives on a crisis,
that he is a tower of silence and per
fectly deaf to clamor. Nevertheless
the voters of South Dakota have
spoken and they have sided against
Mr. Coolidge. South Dakota is criti
cizing him because he rejected the
advice of Senators Lodge and Pepper
when the senators sought to have the
president let his attorney general go.
The back-stairs gossip about Mr.
Daugherty is frightening proof with
many people. Although up to date he
has not actually been found guilty,
still there is no mistaking the sign
that public confidence in him is shak
en, and very badly shaken, at that.
He is a liability right now to the ad
ministration, and not an asset by any
means.
People Want Punishment
The main thing that now concerns
the public is a fear that those found
guilty, or who apparently are guilty,
will go unpunished. The people want
action, sharp and decisive, and no
monkeying or delaying matters on

the part of Uncle Sam and his attor
neys in punishig those found guilty.
The people are thinking of former
Secretary Fall, Mr. Doheny, Mr. Sin
clair and possibly others. They are
wondering about criminal indict
ments and they are not going to be
satisfied simply by watching the sen
atorial fire department running to a
fire unless they can get action and
have the fire put out by that depart
ment when it gets on the legel scene.
C. C. Chase, cpilector of customs
at El Paso, Texas, has gotten out
while the going was good. He is a
son-in-law of Albert B. Fall, and suc
ceeded in getting mixed up in try
ing to help father-in-law deceive the
senate committee, and the country
about that SIOO,OOO loan. Chase tried
unsuccessfully to get a man in Cleve
land, Ohio, to say publicly that he
loaned Fall the money, but the Cleve
land man wouldn’t stand for such
stuff and Chase got caught in the
trap. The senate has started pro
ceedings to have congress impeach
him but he resigned and went in a
hurry.
Harry Sinclair, noted oil man, will
in all probability find himself in real
hot water before he gets through
with the senate for failure to give
testimony. So will others. This
troversy is proving rich picking for
newspaper men and the readers.
To Help Herman*
The house of representatives has
passed a bll givng relief to the starv
ng women and children of Germany.
It means tapping the U. S. treasury
to the extent of $10,000,000 if it be
comes a law, but the matter has jet
the gauntlet of the senate and the
White House to run. No American
wants to see women and children
starve to death, but there are many
adverse reports on this affair. Re
ports come that the German barons
are hoarding food, and it is suggested
that the German officials or German
government commandeer the food
barons in their own country and see
if they can’t solve the question them
selves. At least there is a question
about the wisdom of America throw
ing ten millions of dollars into Ger
many. . .
The Democrats in congress are feel
ing pretty cocky these days; they
feel that they have the Republicans
on the run through the results so far
obtained in the senate investigations;
they have come to a state of mind
where they feel that they are going
to be able to elect their man, no mat
ter who shall be their nominee. And
as time goes on and we approach the

SENATE Met at noon; recessed at

By a vote of 72 to 1, with Senator

negative, the senate certified the

ed to testify before the oil investi
gating committee, to the district at
orney of this district on a contempt

kansas, debated for an hour the ques
tion of the powers of the senate.
Passed the 2-cent gasoline tax bill
for motor vehicles, with an amend
ment by Senator McKellar, Tennes
see, which will continue the personal
property tax.
Before the oil investigating com
mittee, C. C. Chase, of El Paso, Tex
as, son-in-law of former Secretary
Fall, refused to testify on the ground
that it might incriminate him.
Income tax officials told the com
mittee investigating the internal re
venue bureau that files on tax re
turns of concerns in which Secretary
Mellon is interested would be sub
mitted as an answer to insinuations
by witnesses that “Mellon companies”
had received preferential treatment
in tax matters.
Chairman Smoot ordered night ses
sions to speed up consideration of
the tax bill. In a formal statement
he declared the house bonus bill
would cost $4,856,750,087 instead of
the $2,119,000.00 estimated by Chair
man Green of the Ways and Means
committee.
The committee investigating alleg
ed Texas land frauds got under way
with Rush D. Simnyms, chief inspec
tor of the postoffice department, as

eau of engraving and printing.

Representative Treadway, Massa
chusetts, introduced a resolution ask
ing the house to take “appropriate
action” on charges that Senator Car
away', Arkansas, had criticized im
properly the house and Speaker G l
lett in a speech in the senate. The
resolution led to a short but spirited
debate, in which the speaker defended
his right to criticize the senate in
an address not delivered on the floor
of the house, but at his request the
resolution was withdrawn.
The immigration committee, in a
formal report on the Johnson immi
gration bill, declared immediate can
cellation of the “gentleman’s agree
ment” with Japan regarding immi
gration would be justified.
Expert witnesses before the rivers
and harbors comittee contended that
national conventions, the contest is
going to wax hotter and hotter.
Mr. McAdoo, who received consid
erable of a setback through the dis
closure of his connection with Do
heny and Sinclair interests, has par
tially recovered his equilibrium by
his big victory recently in Georgia.
The McAdoo followers seem to feel
that if they can’t nominate their
man that they at least can dictate
the nominee to the convention, al
though they have by no means given
up the idea of nominating the man
from Georgia—New York—California
next June, in New York.
Don’t Want Religious Scraps
Some of the Democrats who are
?artial to Governor A 1 Smith, of New
ork, are going on the theory that
the fact of Smith being a Roman
Catholic ought not to prevent him
from receiving the Democratic nom
ination. They are saying that this re
lgious queston is bound to be fought
out some time, so why not bring on
the scrap in 1924 and settle it one
way or the other, first as last. The
Klen of the United Stales would wel
come such an opportunity as that to
make itself felt, but there is no use
of expecting that fight to develop
this year. The other Democrats of
the nation are too smart to walk in
to an open trap like that, not on your
life will they permit such a fight to
be started this year. Smth hasn’t a
look-in for the Democratc nomina
tion. If it were left up to one state,
and New York was that state, the
writer would say that he had an op
portunity for the nomination, but
don’t fool yourself, the Democratic
party of the nation is not going to
let New York state lead the party to
a premeditated suicide anything like
that.
Other Scandals
Yes, the United States and the Re
publican patry has been rocked with
csandals this spring. They couldn’t
he much worse, but Uncle Sam is not
the only country to suffer in this way.
It is not so many years ago since
France was rocked far worse over the
Panama canal scandals which so
shocked the world at that time.
Great Britain has had its upheavals
that have upset its cabinets and even
rocked its noted premier, Lloyd
George, out of office.
Of course this is no excuse for the
troubles the United States is in. Our
oil affair is not lovelv, in fact it
smells to high heaven, but the thing
to do is to clean house, thoroughly
fumigate it and go on. The Demo
crats say the Republicans can’t sur
vive the 1924 scandals, but the Re
publicans are going to try to live and
i lean house themaelves and go on
with a clean slate if they can.
Thus we approach the 1924 cam
paign orators to say nothing of the
piess to the country which undoubt
cdly will be drawn Into the thickest
f the fray.

KLAN LECTURE DRAWS CROWD AT
LARNED, KANSAS, DESPITE SNOW
LARNED. KAN., March 31.—Al
though almost snowbound by one of
the largest snows that nad fallen here
in several years, residents of this
community filled the court room in
the court house at a recent lecture
on )‘What is the Ku Klux?” delivered
by T)r. Andrew Potter, pastor of the
First Baptist church, Enid, Okla
homa. The large attendance was no
table because the meeting was adver
tised only by handbills, the local pa
pers refusing to print advertise
ments. Many persons in the audi
ence afterwards joined the order.
The impassable roads, covered in
many places by snowdrifts five feet
deep failed to discourage those de
sious of learning of the geat move
ment.
Declaring that they would not
print an advertisement concerning
anything that “they did not know
was perfectly all right,” the publish
ers of the local papers refused to
print an advertisement of the lecture
announced as “Romanism, as I Saw
It in Europe,” although they pub
lished 13 patent medicines advertise
ments in the current issues.
Doctor Potter declared that the
community needed to learn what the
order stood for and changed his sub
ject. Both of the papers at first ac
cepted the advertisements and money
in payment for them but returned
them, branding the advertisements
as inflammatory. Observers declared
that the brief stories about the meet
ing printed by these papers were
more inflammatory than the adver
tisements.
“Klansmen are the most militant
and powerful force In this country
today for the preservation of Ameri
can ideals and liberty,” Doctor Pot-
attack Secretary Mellon, who is stat
ed as the next victim.
HOUSE-Continued consideration
of the army appropriation bill. This
legislation is to be followed in the
house by the independent offices bill,
then comes the immigration bill. The
latter will be reached in about one
week.
