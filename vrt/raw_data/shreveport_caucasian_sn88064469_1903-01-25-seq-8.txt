The City Improvement League of
Shreveport.
An interesting meeting of ladies was
held in the parlor of the Athletic Club
Friday at which there was considered
the organization of a civic league. The
assemblage was called to order at ii
a.m. by Mrs. John Shuttleworth. Mrs.
E. B. Rand was secretary. Among the
representative ladies of v' rious clubs
were Mayor Querbes and several mem
bers of the city council, Dr. J. C. Egan
and Hon. J. H. Shepherd. Over the
meeting Miss Lavinia Egan. named as
president, presided. The proposed con
stitution and by-laws was outlined by
Mrs. Shuttleworth. The organization is
to be known as the City Improvement
League. Its purpose is to unite all citi
zens in a betterment of the city in all
its phases and conditions. The league
propose to use its full influence towards
the enforcement of all ordinances which
will lead to cleaner and better streets
and sidewalks and which will make the
city healthier and more attractive. As
said a charming lady friend of the
Caucasian: "When our league is fully
organized you will not see on the side
walks and streets 'dodgers' and hand
bills arid. waste paper -scattered about:
'everything will be clean." added the
lady with etithusiasm. and the Caucasian.
man .politely rejoined: "And the ladies,
i pre~mme, will also keep eyes on the
'men and make them walk a chalk line,"
at which- odt friend nodded approvingly

The statistics of births, deaths anc
marriages show that an average of be
tween 30 and 40 white women in this
city marry negroes every year. There
were 31 cases of mixed marriages of
this sort in 1901. and for 19o02, whiX.
the record is not fully made up, there
are probably 35 recorded. Such mar
riages have not taken place in the Back
Bay. it is true, but they go on with such
frequency among the working pepole as
to evoke no comment from their neigh
bors or the officials or clergymen who
perform the cei emonv.
In five years 30 was the average, and
in 19co there were 35.
In nearly every case it is a colored
man who marries a white woman. The
union of a white man with a colored
woman is about one a year.
The first marriage 'of the kind in
1902 was on January 16, when Leon
Ivory, a colored teamster of 32 years,
was married to Julia Scott. a widow of
30. She kept house at 27 Wheeler street
and he boarded there. They were united
by F. O. Emerson, a justice of the
peace, on Boylston street.
Next J, W. Jenkins, colored, aged 47,
won Jennie Sioga, a widow fourteen
years his Junior. They were a waiter
and waitress, he living at 54 North An
derson street and she at 44 Anderson
street. Theirs was also a justice of the
peace wedding, and C. A. Fehyl per
formed it on February 5.
On Aprif 6 Antonio Lopez of 450
Hanover street, a seaman.' took to him
self Mary Auallar, a housekeeper at the
same address. She was' a portuguese
young woman of 26.
Rosa, Gregory, 2g, .a waitress; living
at 16 Village street, wedded Charles
James, one eyar older than herself. He
-was a barber at ,6 Ohio street and came
fro Atustin, Tex. They were wedded
