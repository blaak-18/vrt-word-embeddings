Mrs. Hepburn's Companion. 11
Mrs Ileplinsn, a lady nearing eiglh
ty years of t'age, but tall and erect, ,
u lth large soft black eyes, and a noble t
vet sweet faue, sat in her hondoir. f
listeninig gravely to the lamentation of
her niece, a fussy, overdrellssed wo
'ilan, of forlty, or thee lalhouts.
'The older lady, being a childless
widow of great wealth, was aeeus
tinnied to receiving frequenlt visits n
'from her numierous relatives, and be-. t
ing called 1111)1 to sympathize in all
their trtubles.
More especially did her present t
visitor, Jennie llarknier, make such a
denm: d 1upon1 her time and patince. e.
IRlbert HIfarkuer, the only son of ,
the fussy widow, a men of twenty- j,
two, had beenl fromt his babyhood the
pride and darling of h great-aunt,
and rsy visions of his inheritanee of I
all her I)possessilons hallllted his antlh- t
er's dreams. Fromt a child the wily s
womtant had trained her Msln to be all r
Ihis aunt desired, :and froi a child he t
had sturdily resisted all attempts to
foice him into a slavish hypocrisy.
It may have been this very mantr
litness, contrasting with the servile t
flattering of the otheris, that hail first
won fo;r him his aunt's atlection, andw
it is ce ilailn t here wais a Itdl of love
between them entirely itltepelltldett
of hank 'erontts andi real estate. 0
F:eleliog thus. 1Mrs lephurn gave her s
tiece grave attention when she said
v•ehemenl'tly :1
"I a lln it sttclh trouble alboult Rob."
"Trolile ! Is lihe ill f"
"Oh, no ; fitt worse than that."
"Y'u oineattot mteati that he is in f
disgrace."
"Oh no, indeed !" and the little wo- t
mant rutlied her ribbotls, as a bird i
does its feathers. u
"W\'hat is it then f" said Mrs Ilhp- t
hurn, with a most unusal' rilg of ,
impl;atiencce in her gentle voice. I
"11', has fallen in, love with a vaul.

With this, as Itrs. Hepburn was
known to remain firm in her Ii
plans, Mrs. lHairker was firced to tie
conlteit, and thlle nlext week 3irs. Hell
i burli left tie ci.ty withouit giving hier 1
slumnler address to her dear niece."
It miight haiive solnewh;at astoilished
tha;t laiy, had she looked ilto t Ihe
private sittiitgi'oomli of Mr. Ilolt, tihe
pltincipal of Green Vallvy Sueliinalty
it thet early pairt of July, to see Mire.

liall evidently ulpoli tdie flooting of anI
old friend. Gelntle IiiMlr. H-olt knitted
busilyl, speakinIg niow alld theli, as
Mrts. Hepburn pursued a train of in
quities.
"Yes," Mlr. Holt said, in answerte
one of these, "Miss Seabright is an
orpllhan, attd lher only hiomie fir years
was the alms-lhouse. She came here
first ais an erraid girl, to atteid the 1
the door, clean knives anlt run er

starving for education, and we took
Iher inlto the school. She well re
paid all the efforts we made to edu-i
carte hIer, anid at sixteen was a Ipuplil
teacther, studyitng the higher branches
while teaching the lowert ones. Two
yea:rs ago shie took the place as Mrs.

"Shie is well educated, wtat more T'
"A gentle, refined lady," said Mrs.
Hiolt; "'a conscietltiousa, nioble woman !

"Will you lelld her to mie for the
holidiays I IamI goinig to take a trip
to tlie White Moulntlais, Nitgara and
Cailnada, liad I want la pleasant com
ilpaliol, I will lily the samte salary

"What a treat for Edna!" cried
Mrs. Ilolt. "We will ghltly' lend hter
for such a pleasanIt simtter, iMrs.
Hepburn. Slhail I introduee Itei' now 1"
Site left tihe room as Mrs. Helpb'rn
assented, and returned inl a few umin
utes with a tall, graceful girl of about
twelnty.
The first sight of hier face excused
Rob to his aUnt's heart. It was so
delicately fair and sweet, yet with a
noble Oignity of exlpressiol, that won
the old lady to Rob's side at the out
set.
A short coversation, during which
thlte lovely ftee grew radiant at tlhe
prospects Mrs. Hepburn offered, conm
ipleted the conquest the first look had
gained.
As soon as Edna could get ready
I thie two lef't Green Valley, atd started
e upon a simImer (f delightllfl tralvel.
Whtilly nucons'ious of the close
scrutiny of evey word and action,
Edta Senbright, with a warm grati
tude, devoted herself to her new em
ployer.
Thoughi she looked no further titan
to the fall, to break the pleasanit com
r panuloship, she made every efbfort to
Slighten the hours of intercourse and
make herself useful to Mrs. Ilephutrn. i
She aippreciated keenly the perfect v
equality of position, accorded her tl
from the first. knowing well the at. n
tentions of Mrs. Ilephlurn'st friends, e
fiequently encountered, would never tl
have been so cordially exteided had fi
shite een introduced a1s "m'iy colln
paniou," instead of the gentle words : b
"'My young friend, Miss Seabri'ht."
She wa~s of a sunny, bright temperI'. h
ament, and even the discomforts of i)
travel lost half their annoyance in
her pleasant manner of mneeting them. II
In the delightful resting places j3
where they sojour'ned for a week iat y
a tiue, Mrs. Hepburn found all the to
well-known spots took a new beauty d
when shared with her new compan- y
ion, whose frank delight was as pleas- ti
ant as a chihl's to behold. o
She dressed simply, even within
her mneans, but had an artistic taste y
that mlade the plain garments ever A
suitable and becoming, while her few
ribbons suited her young beauty bet
ter than jewels. a
Whlien she found Mrs. Ilepburn
weary with a long ride or hours of tl
railway jolting, she could soothe her d
to the sweetest lest by singing. as d
she gently smoothed the silver hair, I
or calessed the withered hands. tl
With all her train of cringing rel
atives it was sor.ething new to the ai
old lady to receive loving service. Y
She had made no further engagement *ji
with Edna, had held out no goldei 11
promises, but by gentle kindness she
had won the gir's warm heart to anll ft
enthusiastic affeiction. 4
It was no thought of salary or
future favors that Enda Seabright i
gave a daughter's tenderest care to d
the old lady who was giving her the w
novel happiness of a summer pleas- g
nre tlip. She was sorry to thitlk of 1
the parting soon to come; but she s!
meant to prove her gratitude by every Il
loving device, while she was still it
Mrs. Ilephurn's collanion. gi
And Rob. IHarkner, in his law office I
in townl, found no consolation inl legal ci
studies for the keen pang of disap
pi'intnmeit hoe had experienced when .l
Mrs. Ilolt told him Miss Seabright be
was traveling for the summnler anrd had a
no perlmanent address.
"'Aunt hMaria off, too, nobody knows 31
where," the young Iman thought dis- tol
consolately," "so I might as well go
back to town." E
Which he did, thereby receiving at
the earliest moment a delicately writ- gi
len letter firom Mrs. Ilephurn, dated S
lBoston, begging him to meet her at "
the 'I'- ouse and escort her home. tI
"Odd," he muttered, "after run- cl
ning about all summer alone, site can
not come fromt Boston without an as- Y
cort." ti
lint with Rob, t hear his great t
111llt' Wistlslles tum to iiIeyV Lttll. 11, a Inr ii
thie next train found him hastening to A
losto+n. R
lie found his aunt stitting ill a pri- h
vate sitting room of the hotel flomn
which sihe had written, rocking her- it
selflazily and musing. He judged ti
that her meditations were pleasant by tl
the smile uponi, her lips. It
She gave him a cordial welcome,
after a little chat, she said: 11
'"Rob, did you ever think I meant d
to make yoIu ny heie ?" y
The color rushed to Roh's face, but
after a mnonment of confusion he lifted "
his eyes frankly, saying : tl
"I thought you would not forget a
me if you made a will, Aunt Maria,
Ihut firont ny Iheart I hope that it will
be a long tinie before I know wlhether
yonI will or not."
"Thatnk you, Rob; I believe y'cu. I b
think yon love ile." i
"I do love you," was the earnest a
reply.
'"Then I hope you will grant me ac
request I anm about to make, that will u
give me great happiness if you do."
"I shlould notlikely refuse any re- .
quest you make."
"I have a friend, Rob, a very dear t
young firiend, wholl is one |of thle love- I
liest girls I ever knew. Our friend- I
ship is of very recent date, but it is I
strong and true. It is nlm dearest
hope that when you meet her you
may love hier, may win her love." s
"Impossible !"
"Stay a momenlt, Roll, I am notio
quite so foolish anl old woman as to
wish you to prolnise to marry a(
stranger. But I want you to remnain
with us for a short time, and try to
like lmy friend, and win her to like
yon,."
"I would be a scoundrel if I did
that."
"A scoundrel !"
"Yes, for I have already given my
love and won a returnl."
I'And did not tell me, Rob!"
"Only because I have not known I
where to find you all summer."
"But your mothler says your choice
I hlas fallen upon a vulgar nobody, a
penniless ollthan."
S"My motther has never seen Edna!
It is true site is an orplanl, born in
S'the alnlms-bouse, but sahe hias been be
Sfriended and eucated by golentle, re
;fined people, and tlhere is no taint of
vulgarity about her. Aunt Maria,
Sdo you think. I am a man to love a
vulgar wolan "il "
S"No, Rob; but think! an alms
house orphlan !"
S"But a gentle, lovely woman, the
U woman I love I might seem to agree
a in your Iplace, auntie, but you see
Sthat it would be a scoundrel's part
to court your fri'end, when both love
and honor hild timle to Edna."
"II ''Honor, Rob !"
e "Yes, for she knows my love and
hIas confessed her own. Conltd any
d true man desert a womani after that ?"
"But broken engagements are eve
y ry-day evenlets. Come, Rob, hIe rea
d sonable. Draw off little by little, and
let me introduce the gril I wish my
0 heir to marry."
SIn an instant Rob's lips were firmly
set, and his eyes took a steady light
Sof resolution. Never had Mrs. Hep
burn heard so manly a ring to his
Svoice as it took when le answered :
"To please you, Aunut Maria, I
Swould do anything honorable, and if
id were free, I would try to give even
imy love where you dictated. Bitt to F;
Will your mIoney, to place my.self iin
the lpositioll of your heir, I would
not lift a finger. It' you mean tthe

friend wed your heir, if you wish. I'

lih rose a s hie spoke, as if Ih wouli td

l1,rn pulit her thand upon hiii,+ I ariL. ItI
"Stay, Rob," she saiid, "I did not
mean to wound yout ; I should have oP

"Indeed you c;an ! I al heartily at or

"Will yo r'iing the bell nlear you li"'' o
A seirvant unlsweell the sittumuons, 1il
and Mrs. Hepbutrn said: ki
"Goi to No. 1, uand ask the hlady th

41414, as the selvetit departed, "You ii

"I wont't prolmise. All! I hear lVmy y

There was a rustle of skirts, the to

"Yo''ul Ineed niot fear tllat," said se

"You ! Do you know her '" asked np

Pastry for P'ies.-Allow a pound of
sifted ,lour (equal to a quart) to a
pound' of gold hbutter. l)ivide the
bultter i1to 4ilnr equal parts, and
three of those parts divide again into
two, nlakinlg c~u e piece four ounces,
:-414 six pieces two ounces each. Put
the floutr iito a mixiug 'bowl, and
withl a kife cutit up and mix the four
once pigecmv inuto it. Add ice cold wa
ler HbaIrly sutlicient to, moistetn it;
not miore thai half a tuntblerfll.
T''oo much water will make it tough,
too inich fworiking will nmake it heavy.
.Mix it well w ith a broad kniti: (pro
ceedl as le..t as possible) andl do nlot
work it too long. Sprinkle your slab
or hmoard with smie adlditional flour.
talke tie l IuImp of ptaste ftimii tae howl,
and roll it out iaitO a sheet. Divide
one of the two ounce portions of
bultter into little bits, and with a
knife seatter them equally all over
the sheet of paste ; dredge some olir
over it. fiol it so as to cover- the hut
ter, and roll it out again. Pioceed
in this manner until you have gtot in
the six pieces of butter; roll very
last, bearting on lightly; you will
s-mot see th e paste p:llinug into little
blistels, a sign of success.
Besides the first mixing in the bowl,
the bIutter will have ibeeni put in what
are called "six turns." When baked,
you will see that every turn nmakes a
layer or sheet. When the last of the
Ibutter is ill, roll into a sheet, and
roll it round like a scroll. Set it
away to cool for tell minultes at least,
which lets the hItter harden again
anld ia.kes it puttff more. Paste made
slowly is never light or flakey. Mix
quick, roll quick, and avoid handling,
as the warmth of your :-hands will
mlake the paste heavy. IRoll from you
every timen. For plain pastry use ton
ounces of butter to a pound of tflour.
Divide the butter into four pieces,
makingl "ttlreu turns" with the butt
ter.
Cure for Sweeny.-Noticing recent
ly :n inquiiry for a: cure for sweeny, I
send you the following, which I have
used on several valuable animals, and
it never faiilhed to cure: - Take $ of a
pound of fat pork and fry the grease
into a salve; stir three handfuls of
salt into the grease when warm, until
it is perfectly dissolved ; then brnise
well three eggs, shells and all, and
thoroughly mix with tle first two in
gredients, after they have become
sulliciently cool to not cook the eegs.
Apply the salve to the part afflcted,
at intervals of thrce days each, rub
hing the part thoroughlly, then warm
in with a hot ir'oI. hohling it as near
the part aflicted as possiole, so that
it may be well warlmedl, but not burn
ed. Three applications will general
ly cute; but if the sweeny is bad,
nlore applicatiolns will perhaps be
needed.
Ashes for Cattle.-The Live Stock
Journal has a correspondent who
fo.uud his cattle given to the habit of
eating wood, chewing bones, &c.
They became thin in flesh, refused to
eat hay, and presented a sickly ap
peal'ance. lie had no imprIession
that their food lacked the constitu
ents for nmaking bone, and his neigh
bors used boute meal without noticing
any good results whatever. At last
he put about four bushels of leached
ashes in his barnyard, and threw out
to tlhem ahoult a shovelfull each day.
'They all ate with evidce:t relish. Al
ter turning thern out to thlet pasture,
hle Iut olle peck of dry ashee per
week on the grouid iu the pasture.
They ate it :all an gnawedl off the
grass where it had been laying. The
cattle begrauu to improve, gaini,g Hesh,
antd looklg better than they had for
several years. lie says this morbid
appear'ance was unnotiCled years ago,
front tile fact that the grounnd was
ntew and ashy froim thle burning of
woods and haud clearings. Since this
dliscovery lie gives otie quart of salt
mixed with o(le qt:&rt of ashes to
twelve head of cattle about onee it
weuk.
