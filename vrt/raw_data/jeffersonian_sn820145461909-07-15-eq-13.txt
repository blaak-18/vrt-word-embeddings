What He Wrote to Archibald
Selma, Ala., July 8, 1909.
Rev. R. M. Archibald,
West End, Birmingham, Ala.
My Dear Sir:
I just want to write and tell you
how much I appreciated reading Mr.
Thos. E. Watson’s all-too-mild reply
in the current issue of his weekly,
“The Jeffersonian,” to your attack
on him in a recent number of the
Alabama Christian Advocate. My
face looked like a wave on a slop
bucket when I read it and the freckle
brigade encamped on my two retir
ing cheeks had to hot-hoof it to the
tall timber.
I have no excuse for butting in on
this discussion, except that I want to
express my regret at the show of
temper and teeth many of our min
istrs of the gospel are making at Mr.
Matson. It’s all right to take issue
with the man, but why not establish
the rumor that they are teachers and
followers of the meek and lowly One,
and at least show the ear-marks of
the gentleman and fight Mr. Watson
with facts and not foul-mouth per
sonal abuse? This is at least worth
a trial. Os course it may be lese
majests (whatever that is) for a red
headed newspaper man to even hint
that a minister is not infallible, yet
despite that glaring fact, my little
dried-up soul won’t permit me to re
frain from exuding from the pores of
my pink kivered brain garage the
mild suggestion that it is barely pos
sible in this Foreign Mission instance
that Tom Watson is RIGHT and his
argument can’t be met. No man
who knows him will question his mo
tives. He himself is a devout Bap
tist Christian—he is as honest as the
days are long. I believe, sometimes,
that he has the welfare of his fellow
being nearer at heart than many of
those ministers who are heaping
coarse villification upon him. He
may be wrong oftimes as regards his
notions about how the Government
ought to be run—although it’s
mighty hard to prove when you come
to think of it—but on most proposi
tions, were we all blessed more with

Magazine.
charity and tolerance of opinion, and
freed from prejudice, a majority of
the people are bound to admit that
he is right. He has proven the
righteousness of his contention with
simple facts and figures that he is
DEAD RIGHT about Foreign Mis
sions. If you will keep your head as
coolly as Watson has, read every is
sue of both his publications since
about April last, will reply to him in
the spirit Jesus teaches us is correct,
and rout his stand by logic, reason,
facts and figures—prove that he is
wrong, I’ll see to it that the biggest
side of Dallas County pork is sent
you express prepaid—and we raise
some fine meat down here, too. If
on the other hand, you are unable to
meet him, don’t you think it due Mr.
Watson and the cause you espouse
to make an apology to him? Are
you not that fair-minded? There are
thousands of people who are with
him in this fight and you may bet
your hosiery he’s going to win. He’s
played fair and has abused no one.
He has the facts to back him.
There’s something which has ceased
to live up the little brooklet some
where! Why, and where is it? For
what reason is Watson abused, when
he has proved that he is right?
I am not getting paid for writing
this, although I think I ought to be
—don’t you? Don’t know Mr. Wat
son personally, but have read every
word he has written for the past five
years and regard his as one of the
master minds of this generation, and
have learned to admire him very
much. As little as you may think
of it, I am also a Christian—a Bap
tist—and all my kinfolks are. I sim
ply take this opportunity to try to
make you and others think a little,
thus locating the error of your way.
Be sure to read the current issue of
the Jeffersonian; it’s interesting in
some ways.
Don’t get sore at me. My motives
are genuine.
Most sincerely,
GROVER C. HALL,
Managing Editor the Selma Times
