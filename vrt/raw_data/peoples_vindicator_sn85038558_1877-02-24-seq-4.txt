Some interesting statistics is dte i,
fon:it in the "Rleport of the Coin- in the
mnissioner of Agriculture" for the jri
:ear 1873. One fact is well worth ter w
the stuldy of our ftarn:rs, , which as on
is, that the report based on actual te
figures, shows that the very large Ipowe
crops of cotton made in the South ViAs
failed to 3iel as much money as er
a inediuimi one. For example, or a
when the crlop of 1869, 3,154,946 crow
hales, sold at 23 6-10 cents per ,t bha
pound, the crop of T870, 4,352,- othe
317 bales, sold for 11 9-10 cents roil
per pound; so that the large crop the
brought $14,633,191 less than the tilth
preceding mueditum crop. In 1871 nI
the crop declined to 2,974,351 the
hales, and the price roseto 19 3-10 "til
cents per pound. By these figures 1
we at once see what the crop. ,lhio
should average to yield average th?
gross value. 3,000,000 bales pro- g
duced yearly will bring as much the
money to thefarmners as four or five. tâ€¢eil

The leire acnet of unchecking and re
checking the animal has sometimes
answered the ptrrpme. It took his
attention off in another direction,
changed the current of his thought,
and broke up his purpose and deter- I

reason an apple, or a bunch of grass
from the roadside, or a handful of I
oats, or a few, kernels of'corn, will1
often accomplish what an hour of
beating could never effect.

with passion, his brain charged withl

Slearly; and it is jost this thinking

in directing and controlling horses.
