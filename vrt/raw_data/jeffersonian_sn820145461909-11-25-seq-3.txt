Labor Unions, Farmers 9 Union, Duck, Bodev
Dear Sir:—l notice in The Jeffer
sonian of November 11th an article
regarding the Union Labor leaders
that has somewhat aroused my cu
riosity. Notwithstanding you have
had my attention for about fifteen
years, and I think that you make
some of the most flagrant charges,
or rather allude to something that
the officers are doing, the which I
think you should come out flatfooted
with the whole goods against them,
—as you know that hints won’t do, —
and as I am one man that having
been a member both of the Granite
Cutters’ Union and of the Farm
ers’ Union, ever since there have been
Unions in this country, and as I have
tried to be loyal to all classes of peo
ple, as well as the Union, I respect
fully call on you for the whole goods,
—as lam by you just like a little
boy once was by his grandmother
about some very nice fried fish. He
began to dance and cry, “Grandma,
give me some more fish.” “Ah, go
away, Fred, there ain't no more
fish.” Fred cried and he cried and
bawled, until Grandma eased the
stove door open, thinking to slip just
on? nice piece off for Fred. When Fred
spied a great big dishful of fish, he
jumped up and down, “Zigity, I
knowed there was more in dere.”
Now, I know you have some more
fish, so out with ’em.
So, if you haven’t any more fish,
probably you have some very fine
ducks, or bears, or some other good
game. It may be that you have
trapped Duck, or a Gompers,—so
hang out your game so that a man
can see it plain. I believe that you
have got it, all right.
Understand, Mr. Watson, I can not
agree with you that the boycott and
the blacklist are the same; notwith
standing the same spirit may prompt
them both, they are not exhibited
alike, —neither do they accomplish
the same results. The difference is
that one hurts corporations, while
the other hurts the individuals. I
mean as a general thing. Both are
fair, so long as it is fair to organize
or unionize. You say not, but I say
it is. You say that they are infa
mous. Stop right here a little bit.
You should remember that todaj r
you are living in a country not only
where the Adamites dwell, but where
the corporations, amalgamations and
trusts are only second to hell.
Therefore, dig up these infernal
things by the roots, cause these hyp
ocrites to have mercy when they em
ploy laborers, and give them a rea
sonable compensation for hard labor,
at least enough to reasonably school,
feed and clothe their families. Then
we would not have a Union, nor a
boycott. Neither would a corpora
tion that is worth from one to five
hundred thousand dollars stoop so
low down as to want to blacklist a
man, just one man that has a wife
and about thirteen children, just be
cause the poor fellow asked said cor
poration to raise his wages from 60
cents to 80 cents per day, when it
would have at least cost him $1.50
per day to have kept them in bread
and meat, to say nothing of educa
tion and a few rags. So we claim
that any civil means is fair against
such oppression. So dig up such
oppression and blacklist, for they
and Ladson
started it, and we will dig up the
Union and boycott.
Now there is one more item in
this same article I wish to stir up
your old Adam about, and that is
upon the advice that you give the
farmers sticking to their own knit
ting. Now, Mr. Watson, be fair with
us. I believe you will. I have been
trying to help organize the farmers,
in good faith, and doing everything
possible I could to help them, hav
ing been reared on the farm myself
and know its miseries and hard
times, and believing that I knew a
great deal about successful unionism,
having been a Union man for twen
ty-five years,—though I admit that
there is not a feather nor anything
that looks like a wing yet on me.
Nor have I tried to make the farmers
believe that I had them. And I also
deny the charge that you make that
the wage-earner—that is, all of
them—would do things that some
corporations would do. So you see
that I haven’t any feathers on my
legs, either, —and I am satisfied that
there are plenty of good citizens,
farmers, that know that there are
members of other Unions that have
done more to help them than any of
their own class could have done, and
they know that if all classes of or
ganized labor were properly affiliated
that there is good that can be ac
complished that you don’t know of,
because you are not on the inside.
Now, Mr. Watson, if I haven’t said
enough yet to make you tell what’s
dead up the branch, I will say it. I
said above that I had done all I could
to help organize. Now, Mr. Wat
son, I pledge myself to you, if you
will do one thing. Bring out the
fish, —whether they be Ducks, Dun
cans, Barretts or Gomperses or
Mitchells. Let us see that Republi
can wholesale deal that they are
making of us. If you do this, I will
disorganize more in two months
than the whole caboodle of them can
organize in two years. Bring them
out. JAMES H. NEW.

Answer.
(1) My friend has misunderstood
me in the matter of the membership
of Unions. There is no reason in
the world why the same citizen
should not be a good Church mem
ber, a good Mason, a good Farmers’
Union man and a good Labor Union
man. What I have said, and most
earnestly repeat, is that the farmers’
organizations ought not to have any
entangling alliances with the labor
organizations, or with any other or
ganization whose interest is not
strictly agricultural.
For instance, the farmers of the
country do not wish to force labor
ing people to join the Union. They
think that every wage-earner should
have the right of a freeman, to join,
or not join, any League, Union, or
organization whatsoever. He ought
not to be compelled to join it, as an
alternative to starvation.
If the farmers adopted the policy
which Mr. Gompers wants them to
adopt, and refuse to buy any goods
that do not carry the Union label,
you can see at once how terrible the
onlaix
results would be to merchants,
farmers, and everybody else who
isn’t in a Labor Union, or capital
istic Trust.
(2) Again, Mr. Gompers wishes
to use the power and influence of the
Farmers’ Union, in order that he
may put the Pearre bill on the
statute books. Mr. Bryan was un
doubtedly committed to that bill, in
the last campaign. Had Mr. Bryan
been a good lawyer, he would have
told Mr. Gompers that, even though
Congress should be silly enough to
pass the Pearre bill, and the Presi
dent should be weak enough to sign
it, the Supreme Court would kill it
as dead as a hammer. Such a bill
is not only against the Constitution
of the United States, but against the
Bill of Rights in the Constitutions
of the various States, and also
against the fundamental principles
of Magna Charta.
Inseparably connected with the
title to property, is the legal right
to use it; and the use of property,
in many instances, is synonymous
with “business.” The natural use
of farm land is the “business” of
farming: the natural use of mer
chandise kept in a store is the
“business” of selling it: the natural
use of a cotton mill, equipped with
looms, etc., is the “business” of man
ufacturing. Now, the Pearre bill
seeks to deprive the Courts of the
power to protect a man’s “business.”
Consequently, the bill strikes at the
title, and confiscates at least a part
of the value of the property. There
fore, the Courts would hold that the
Pearre bill deprives the citizen of
his property without due process of
law.
There isn’t a Constitutional law
yer in America who will differ from
me on this proposition.
(3) Again, Mr. Gompers wants
the sanction of the Farmers’ Union
to his defiance of the Courts and of
restraining orders. Through the
officiousness of the bank-wrecking
lawyer C. T. Ladson, Mr. Gompers
got it, —by telegraph, at that.
I don't believe the farmers of this
country will uphold any man in tak
in the law into his own hands and
defying the Courts. Suppose there
is a dispute between you and your
neighbor as to where your land line
is, and both of you claim a certain
belt of good pine timber. Such dis
putes happen every day in our vast
country. Now, your neighbor be
lieves that land is his, puts a force
of hands in there, and starts to cut
ting down the trees, preparatory to
sawing them into lumber. You go
to your neighbor and tell him that
he has no right to cut those trees,
and you request him to discontinue
it. He defies you, and keeps on cut
ting. What are you to do? You
don’t want to kill him: you don’t
want him to kill you; and yet you
don’t want him to cut down your
trees. In that case, you would go
to the Judge of the Superior Court
in the circuit in which you live, with
a written statement of the facts, duly
sworn to, and ask him to send the
Sheriff to that man, with an order
signed by the Judge, telling biin to
quit cutting those trees, until he can
come to Court, and present what-
