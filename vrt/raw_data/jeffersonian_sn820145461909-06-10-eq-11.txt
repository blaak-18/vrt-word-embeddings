OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
We have received such a large
number of letters from our members
on the subjects of “Boys” and
“Girls,” and so many of them are
worth publishing, that we have de
cided to put off the awarding of the
prize until next week. We do not
wish to do anyone an injustice by
making a hasty decision, and it is a
hard matter to pick the winners in
this case. If any of our readers
wish to comment on the letters
which have been published, we shall
be pleased to hear from them.
BOYS ARE EXPENSIVE.
I think some boys are nice. Some
boys are manly and polite, while
others are impolite, rude and un
manly. Boys are more expense to
their parents than girls. When boys
are fifteen years of age, they are not
satisfied unless they have a horse
and buggy, watch and chain and oth
er jewelry. We have not any boys
in our family, and I am real glad,
too. I am a little girl, aged 10.—
Reba Webb, Villa Rica, Ga.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I don’t like the girls too much, ex
cept my three sisters. I love them,
and we love one another. I don’t
think boys ought to love the girls
until they are grown, because girls
have not got good sense until they
are twenty-five years old. I will ad
mit they have some sense, but not
enough to be turned out to graze
for themselves. Frank Joyner,
Montpelier, Miss.
FROM A MISSISSIPPI GIRL.
Boys are so free, glad and happy
hearted, they hardly know what is
meant by care. Their hearts beat
with gladness, and few are melan
choly. They are sure to find just the
road for fun. Some are gentle, sim
ple and honest. They are mindful
what they do, for they realize that
the nation’s gains, joys or pains will
soon depend on them.—Edna Doug
las, aged 15, Maben, Miss.
NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HIS
GIRL.
To the average American boy the
picture of his own girlie comes to
his eyes at the mention of that name
and sets his heart jumping up and
down like a churn-dasher. There is
nothing good enough for her, and he
is always planning some pleasure for
her. She is the apple of his eye, and
any girl who says that boys care
more for baseball than anything else
should see a mirror.—James Wor
sham, aged 13, Macon, Ga.
THE SWEET AND THE SOUR.
I think some girls are as sweet as
chocolate, and others are as sour as
lemon drops. Some girls, if they see
you talking in school, will tell on
you. That is the sour kind. Others,
if the/ see you talking or not study
ing in school, will join in with you,
and if the teacher scolds them they
will not tell on the others. That is
the sweet kind. Some girls are de
ceiving. If they see you at a circus,
or carnival, or a drug store, they will
©lk 3&ffersonian
talk to you and ask you to go to see
them; and after you have treated
them they will leave you, and will
not speak to you next day on the
street or at school. That is another
sour kind. There are two kinds of
girls—the sour and the sweet. I take
the sweet kind, don’t you?—Albert
Mitchell, Pelham, Ga., aged 12.
GOOD ADVICE.
I think most boys have a disposi
tion to be rough; but isn’t it a grand
thing that we have some good ones?
We must have some good boys to
make useful men. Mr. Watson was
once a boy, and he is now one of the
noblest men of the State. If half of
our boys were as industrious as he,
the big sisters would have better
boys to love.—Mabel Pattillo, Rex,
Ga.
THAT’S WHAT’S THE MATTER.
When boys are around, everything
is lively, as, besides being mischiev
ous, some are mean things. After
boys reach the age of twelve, they
are always entertaining, because
they never tire of talking about base
ball and the dress of girls. Boys are
always getting some one into trouble
by telling things at wrong times.
Physiology says that boys have more
brains than girls, but all I have seen
must have too much. —Bertha Mae
Thomas, aged 13, Bowman, Ga.
NOTHING LIKE ’EM.
Girls are very useful. They help
their mothers, and try to be clean
and neat. They play many games,
and work in school to make the boys
keep up. And to keep the girls from
throwing kisses at the other fellows
the boys brush their hair and shine
their shoes. The girls do many
things and do a good deal of work.
And after all there’s nothing like
girls. Merlin Smith, aged 10,
Barnesville, Ga.
ON HAND FOR MEALS.
Boys are sights—always different
from the way they ought to be. They
will be on hand at meal times, if it
breaks a trace. It makes no dif
ference how many places they have
for clothes, they won’t keep them
there. And if they don’t primp on
Sunday, who does? The particular
little gent has to carry a cloth with
him, to wipe off his shoes. Aren’t
they sights?—Winnie Sewell, aged
13, Banning, Ga.
A WORD FROM TEXAS.
This is what I think about boys.
Some people think boys are not
worth anything, and are hard to con
trol; but I do not think so. Boys
make smart and intelligent men, like
Mr. Watson, and they make presi
dents, too. They are as intelligent
and as good as girls. How many
people believe that? I do not believe
in running down the boys. Just give
them a chance. They are very use
ful sometimes—much more than
girls. They do more hard work.—
Gladys Ruth Broach, aged 11, Tabor,
Texas.
