THE VETERANS’ CORNER
“IS THE SOUTH GLAD IT EOST?”
Dear Sir:—May the bright-eyed
goddess of Truth forever smile on
you for this first editorial in the Au
gust number of the magazine.
Yours,
A. H. ELLETT.
Acherman, Miss.
A ‘‘COBB’S LEGION” VET.
Dear Mr. Watson: —Will you
please give space in the Veteran’s
Corner to an old “Confed” with the
lamented and beloved Cobb at
“Fredericksburg” following the for
tunes of the old brigade, 16th, 18th,
24th, Phillips and Cobb’s “Legions,”
Georgia volunteers, through the bat
tle of Chancellorsville, 3d May, 1862,
receiving the appointment of Cadet
and assigned to duty with Gen. Wade
Hampton, from whom he was vari
ously assigned to M. C. Butler, P.
M. B. Young and last to Maj. Henry
S. Farley, with which command he
remained until the surrender.
And now comes this old veteran
asking that he be pensioned under
the recent acts of the Legislature,
all disabilities removed, except the
property qualification, which God
knows I haven’t got.
Before me is a letter from Col. J.
W. Lindsey, Commissioner of Pen
sions, dated Atlanta, Ga., February
23, 1909, who says: “Under the pen
sion laws of Georgia no pension is
paid to persons residing out of Geor
gia, it is only to resident citizens
pensions are paid, none can be paid
you in Mississippi.”
If I understand the meaning of
pensioning a soldier, it is the expres
sion of a noble purpose to provide
for the evil days which have fallen
upon him, and in this way the gov
ernment for which he fought will
shelter him. It is no answer to say
he is a non-resident, he has render
ed the service to the State and coun
try 40 years ago, performing the
drudgeries of camp life, incurring
the dangers in battle and on the sen
tinel’s post and should have a pension
equal to the man who still lives in
Georgia; they should be on a per
fect, equality before the law; having
done service for his country, such
service should be recognized.
There are other places where the
pensions are greater than they should
be, and can be reduced to the rea
sonable honoring of the dead.
I do not inveigh against the dead,
I like to see them honored, the glori
ous, silent dead, who rendered up
their life in battle; no greater sacri
fice could they offer, no tribute so
glorious than to die for their coun
try.
But is there not something due the
war-worn, non-resident, living veter
an: are the alabaster boxes of your
love and tenderness sealed up until I
am dead? I want some tenderness
and sweetness while living, so that
my ears can hear and my heart be
filled and made happier by them;
the kind things you mean to do when
I am gone, do before I go, that they
may brighten and sweeten my home
before I leave it. If you have any
good deeds to perform over my dead
body, I would rather you bring them
out in my weary and troubled hours
that I may be refreshed and cheered
by them while I need them. I would
rather be wrapped in my blanket
without a flower, a funeral without an
eulogy, than a life without the sweet
ness of love and sympathy. “The
eulogy of the dead can be of no oth
er avail than to manifest to the liv
ing.” Then let us learn to follow
the teachings of the blessed Master
and anoint our friends beforehand
for the burial. Post-mortem kind
ness does not cheer the troubled
spirit. Flowers on the grave cast no
fragrance backward over life’s weary
course. Yours truly,
S. T. DENT.
Arbo, Miss., Aug. 22, 1909.
AN OLD VET GONE.
Dear Sir:—l should have written
you two months ago, but being in
great trouble have neglected it from
time to time until I scarcely know
what to say.
I have concluded that you may not
know that my husband, J. M. Ram
sey, is dead, and that I ought to write
you about it.
He died of congestion on June 11.
He was taken suddenly ill two days
before he was to start to Memphis to
attend the soldiers’ reunion.
I had been afraid for him to go,
fearing he would never get back
home. He was 80 years of age and
very feeble. He thought more of
you than any other man, and I would
like you to write a few lines about
his death. I have written some
verses about him, will you give them
place in your paper or magazine? I
will send them in time for next week.
Respectfully yours,
L. E. RAMSEY.

Jeffersonian Club News
Each week we will keep our read
ers posted on the progress of The
Jeffersonian Club movement.
Club No. 1.
Club No. 1 was organized at Thom
son, Ga., last week and is gaining
rapidly in numbers. At the next
meeting, which will be held on Sat
urday, September 18th, it is expect
ed that one hundred new members
will be enrolled.
Clubs on the Way.
This is written on the 16th, be
fore news of the formation of other
clubs has had time to come in. Our
correspondence shows that clubs are
now being organized at ten points in
Georgia, four in Alabama, two in
North Carolina, one in South Caro
lina, three in Mississippi, seven in
Texas, five in Arkansas, one in Illi
nois, one in Indiana, one in Louisi
ana, four in Florida, two in Tennes
see. Organizers have also volunteer
ed from 23 other points in the
South.
Spontaneous Movement.
Beyond the suggestions which
have appeared in the Jeffersonian,
there has been no direction of the
movement. The people wanted an
organization, and they seized eager
ly upon the first chance that offered.
Now it is up to the people, the mem
bers of the clubs, to say what their

FROM AN OLD CRIPPLED REB.
Dear Tom:—l can’t express my
appreciation for you and the great
work you are doing for the poor,
ignorant people, and how little con
cerned they are at the danger near
by.
Tom, 1 can not write much and,
being an old crippled Reb, past three
score and ten, can’t do much, you
know, but as long as I live and can
get the dollar I will be with you,
trusting the good Lord may spare
my life to meet you yet.
I started in with the People’s
Party paper, and stayed with you
ever since.
Well, I will quit, for I don’t think
you will read it.
You will find enclosed a money
order for five ($5.00) dollars to
move me up on both Jeffersonians to
1911. Find names on enclosed pa
per.
Yours very sincerely,
W. C. BENSON.

“THE OLD SOLDIER’S STORY.”
This is the name given by Mrs.
Carlos Dinkins, of Macon, Ga., to a
song which she dedicates to “the
Boys in Grey.”
The music is by L. Til. Adams.
The publishers are Messrs. Proc
tor-Patterson Co., of Macon.
“The Old Soldier’s Story” deserves
a place on the programme at every
Confederate Reunion. The words
are appropriate and touching, the
march-song air stirring and melo
dious.
We predict for Mrs. Dinkins’ bal
lad a general and permanent popu
larity.
organizations shall be, what their
objects, and how they shall work.
The People’s Voice.
Every question that arises will be
submitted to the people for decision.
All local problems will be voted upon
by the members of the local clubs.
All state matters will be brought be
fore every club in the state. No
national organization, and no nation
al policy, can be determined, until
every club in the union has voted
upon it.
An Educational System.
Every issue, local, state and na
tional, will thus be brought squarely
before the people, and in this man
ner the club will become an educa
tional system. Men will be forced
to read and think about the vital
questions of the day. Most of our
troubles are due, not to ignorance,
but to the indifference of the indi
vidual. In an organization, each
member must keep step, or fall out.
The responsibility that rests upon
each man to vote according to his
own convictions of what is best for
all, without regard to party, creed
or caste, will be taught as the cardi
nal principle of these clubs. Each
man must shoulder that responsibil
ity, or be held unworthy. In the
classical words of John Henry, “It’s
up to you”.
