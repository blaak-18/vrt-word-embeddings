In Berlin. In C'ologne. .Munlich, Wies

which oltthials woulil lndoubtedll) y be
glad to spell "ca ws" If only thel (erman
language were eqltal to it. As It is, they
are in depsair. D)r. Anita Augspurg
makes more disturlbance( in Germany
than Dr. Mary Walker ever did in the
United States, and the police there do
not know what to do with her. At ev
ery arrest they are inughled at, and still
they feel as If they must make an ex
ample of this "fighting woman's right
er," as a Berlin newspaper editor calls
her.
At Weimar she descended from a
railway trafi in sight of a policeman.
There had been lately in the little city
much robbery and thieving. The per
spicaclous policeman saw the small
person in knickers and pounced upon
her as a man in disguise, probably the
roblber who had been affrighting the
honest citizens of Weimar. lie asked
her who she was and where she came
from. She replied to him that his im
pudence passed all bounds, and she
bade him lead on to his old station
house. which he dli, perhaps not alto
gether contrary to her desire and ex
pectatlon. for the arrest raised at great
row.
Thie officials of Weimar were put in
a light so ridiculous and so distastasteful

CHINESE WOMEN.
One of Them at last Speaks Up For
Llberty.
Not long since San Francisco was
treated to the spectacle of a Chinese
girl Oc tor proclaiming before a public
a1 of white and oriental men
and a few oriental women fenced off
in a gallery by themselves that the
time has come when the female sex of
China must be enlightened. The old
order must give way to the new.
The girl speaker was Sieh King King,
Chinese maiden who has come from
her own land to receive the education
of a white woman at the California
unlversity at Berkeley. She lives with
her uncle there, and he approves en
tirely of her revolutionary ideas. Sieh
King King makes some statements
that are surprising. She says the Chi
nese men ar"e ready now to give their
women . both liberty and education;
that they would be glad to see their
mothers and sisters raised to a level
with the feminine sex of western na
tions, but the women themselves are
afraid of the light. These stunted,
timid creatures desire freedom above
all things, but wbhe is offered thepa
-they are coward'. I heir sex every
where, and they run away and hide.
China Itself, yeeh says is in a dan
gerous situation, and nothing short of
enlighte ment among its women as
well as men can nave It. 81eh is the

Yet more striking as ilhlustrahting ftem
cago messenger girl. Jaunitle Ionneau.
N,
A GIIL CAUGHT THE 1t.NAWAY.
She is a daughter of the pIeople, no cod.
died rich little girl who had had all the
courage and real woranlllhood "'protect
ed" out of her. Jaunite took the place
of one of the striking messenger boys
who were dismissed from the District
Telegraph service in Chicago. The girl
had an invalid mother to support.
One day she started out to deliver the
usual telegraph envelopes. A mob of
boys followed her. At a signal they 1
made a rush for her and tried to take 1
the messages from her. The leader of
the mob struck -her 1n the face. The 4
blow raised all the spirit in the girl.
She sprang at him like a wildcat and
knoc'ked him dow-n like a man. There I
wasn't any "weak woman" i1, Jaunite's 1
fiat. As the boy fell his 'mates rushed I
toward her. With feminine resource
fulness she grabbed a hatpin out of her i
cap and Jabbed around her in every di
rection. As the jabs struck home, nat
urally those that received these tokens <
of a girl's regard fell back in a ring I
around her. By that time policemen ar
rived and arrested the boys. Jaunlte I
magnanimously declined to appear I
against her vanquished enemy, the mob
leader. ii
"I guess I punished him enough." she
said to the officer. The reader also will
"guess" that she did. The woman read
er will glory in her grit.
The usefulness of a hatpin in the
hands of a woman of pluck was again
demonstrated when. not long ago, a
beautiful and cultivated young lady.
Miss Hamilton, was attacked by a huge
negro. who sprang upon her in a lonely
place. Not once did she lose her head.
The black fellow grasper her by the
throat and attempted to choke her into
insensibility. She waited till his face
was near enough to use woman's weap
on.,tbe hatpin, to best advantage; then
she gave it to him with nall her might
and saved herself. Perhaps this fel
low, too, will think twice another time
before concluding a girl is an easy prey.
Best of all though, Is the story of
Miss McGilnchy, who caught a run
away horse. A horse attached to a car
rlage bolted down a village street, hurl
ing his driver, a woman, to the ground.
A lot of men stood around. and they
shouted:
"Catch himl Catch him!" but not one
ef them made a move to do so. It was
too dangerous.
s"I eai telb `bat bhorse" remarked
al dd him by the bit and held on till
be stopped. Neat time there is a run

in the arrangement of the belt. which
is suggestive of a complete negligee

Is loosely fastened and Is really a

Where a lady likmes white and yet
feels that It is rather too young or too

she can have it falrly covered with

diglitevi plrogress airi excelptions, and
those Ireptrlon.s are mostly cntiiined to
thle ciutt.s of counltry towns a iii snull
cities.
It is thlle time of goiod resolutions. To
begill. let us this 1st of .anuary make
high resolve that during the yeatr 1903
we' will niot fuss and splltter, ome
what will. The ha hit of eliern.ally talk
lng, o(f getting wrought illp over trifles,
is a perpetual i power waster.
Thlie iuentail land spiritual sheil,lists
have lheeti grinding lawviy alt their par
ticular brand of grist till it Ibegins to
be fairly iwell knowni iii the comiunil
ty. Their ftmvorlte preachliment early
andi late is "power from within." They
are right. 'here in no power for you
outside of yourself, inot ievetn thel lOwel'
of God, for that mnust dwell and Ibe
developed within you hefore It will be
manifest. "The kitngdom of heavenll I
within you."
Most wonlen would give the best
year of their lives to know how to gain
power to achieve their ideals. They
are beginning to understand that no
boldy else. not even hlusband or chil
dren, can achieve these for them.
Well. can youl gain power whenl you
pour youlrself out from your toes In
-feeble talk? No matter what the in
cmessat talk is. if it he about fashions,
your ailments. childlren or servants or
gossiping over the foibles or deficlen
{(vis of your alcqualintanell bohind their
backs, you are wasting the very lilfe
bloo)ld of your soul in litl.elllities.
Ise silent and think. Thus and thus
only you gain power. When a civil
engineer wishes to supply i city with
water from a small stream, hle builds a
reservoir and it darm and then lets the
lake fill up silently andl gently. Ex
actly so a womanln mIl.v gainl mental alnd
spiritual power. The greatest men of
all the ages. from Moses to General
Grant. have been "silent men." ('hil
dren weary themselves out in constant
Infantile prattle and babyish excite
ment. Women do the same. The frit
tering away of a life in useless-gabt4e
and squabble and ija fussing over fash
lons and clothes is ill fitting employ
mert for the immortal soul of at wom
an in a land where women have great
er opportunity than anywhere else.
The way to stop this femininei fuss
and sputter Is to stop it. Now. at the
opening of the beautiful new year, Is
the time to begin. Let us resolve, first,
that we will only talk when it is nec
essary. Then. when we dco talk. let us
not criticise any human being. I.t us
each say: I myself anm the soul I have
to work onl. 1'Vhei I myself am abso
lutely perfect. thlle I lmay criticise my
neighbor's doings: not till then.
Let us hI strong ailnd sweet and silent.
Let us clothe ourselves with beauty
from within, the beauty that never
changes its fashion e'xcept to grow
brighter and brighter unto the perfect
day.
