Collector Wilkinson, Judge Fen- a:

Perhaps Mr. Boatner has an eye on

" Chromo-photography, a recent
discovery, promises to show succes- s,
sive pictures of a man at every stage p
I of his development, so as to produce t]
an illusion of actual growth. For- t1
tunately for the matrimonial market, a
no process has yet been invented t
which will show a young man what I
his best girl will look like when she n
is mending the trousers of her sixth t'
child and second boy.
Among the several good bills
passed by the Legislature is the one
ie regard to weights and measures.
The substauce of the bill is as fol
lows: "Whosoever shall falsely and 2
knowingly buy or sell any produce
or merchandise by short weights A
or measure, shall on conviction
thereof, be imprisoned for a term
of not exceeding two years, and a
fined at the discretion of the court tj
not exceeding two thousand dollars." r

Hon. Hiram R. Lott, president
of the Senate of Louisiana, is per- E
haps the most modest statesman in
the United States. He is the first
politician who has refused to send ji
his picture to the press foi publica
tion, and because the Picayune has
published his photograph with a
boigraphical sketch the distinguished i
gentleman from East Carroll desires
:; the world to distinctly understand t
that he had nothing to do with this
display of vanity. It strikes the
average mind that the senator is
seeking notoriety while affecting to
:. hold it in perfect abhorroece.
Is the Senator afraid that some
one will fall in love with him, or
does he fear the dagger of the anar
chist ?
The Chicago Times gives a little
ihsicTe history of the tactics of Mr.
- Pnllman, the owner of the entire
- itjr of that name and who is respon
sible for' the big strike which is not
yet wholly settled, of which the fol- I
lowing is an extract:
"Mr. Pullman and his monopoly
have many side issues in the fire.
"- They do not depend entirely for
their revenues upon the profits of
Sthe business for which the corpora
tion was organized. They have
numerous side issues which paywell.
One of these plums they lost last
i January. WVhen Pullman was built
the corporation made a contract
with the village of Hyde Park to pay
.. 4 cents per 1,ooo gollons for water.
This water was peddled out to the
: Pullman tenants at xo cents per
Sx,ooo gallons, and realized a neat
profit. Pullman paid $I,zoo per
month for 30,000,000ooo gallons of
a:'ter and collected $3,ooo from his
-.tenants for the same. Another
$,2x,ooo per year went toward the
af.- reserve fund."
What more intensely patriotic
. resolution could be framed than the
Sone offered Tuesday in the Senate
by Senator Daniel of Virginia ! Let
theJeremiahs of Europe, who are
hterpreting the Debs manifesto as
c~rack of doom for the Yankee

!-For the Ifrst time'0 In the history )f
of the parish ofiLafayette a certain
amount.has been set apatt or. ap
propriated by the Police Jury in c1
the annual budget for the purpose Wt
of maintaining the public schools. as
formerly the money given to the trl
schools was taken out of the general ad
funds and the School Boaid never~
knew how much the ap propria- st,
tion would be; it was impossible for sO
it to form a basis of operation. di
The amount to be appropriated Cl
was purely problematical; some- hi
times it was $zobo, more, or less. P'
But as a result of the economical th
and business-like way in which the in
Police Jury has managed the affairs M
of the parish it is possible to set bi
aside the handsome sum of $3500 so
for school purposes, out of the as
revenues raised by the regular st
tax of so mills. C
Of the zo ~nill tax levied for to
expenses the Pohce Jury will use P
only about 83/ mills, and the re- al
maining xz mills will be devoted v
to the public schools.
The members of the present Po
lice Jury have always evinced a 01
warm interest in the progress of the
public schools of the parish and P
t whenever called upon to help the ai
schools, they always responded tl
e promptly and liberally. Much of sI
e the growth of the schools is due to P
their assistance. By economically i
administering the public affairs a
I they are enabled to make the v
Lt largest allowance for schools ever 11
e made in this parish. The people s
h throughout the parish will learn of tl
this appropriation with pleasure. h
Last year the schools remained P
opened ten months; with the $3500 P
from the Police Jury another .long d
term is assured. P

i fR. CLEVELAND ON ARBI
e TRA Ti ON.
S Atlanta Constitution.
Our dispatches yesterday in
n timated the probable passage of an r
d act of congress providing for arbi
tration in labor disputes on the line c
, recommended by Mr. Clevtland in
his message eight year ago.
t In the message referred to the
r- president said: t
n The present condition of the relatiosns be- r
t tween labor and capital is far from satisfac
tory. The discontent of the employed is due,
d in a large degree, to the grasping and heed- ¬
less exactions of employers, and the alleged
discrimiation in favor of capital as an object 1
LS of govermental attention. It must also be
conceded that the laboring men are not
always careful to avoid causeless and unjus
:d tifiable disturbance.
:S hough the importance of a better accord I
between these interests is apparent, it must
id be borne in mind that any effori in that
direction by the federal government must be
greatly limited by constitutional restrictions.
se There are many grievances which legislation
is by congress cannot redress, and many condi
tions which cannot by such means be re
to formed.
I am satisfied, however, that something
may be done under federal authority to pre
e- vent the disturbanccs whichi so often arises
from disputes between employers and the
r employed, and which at times seriously
r- threaten the business interests of the country,
and in my opinion the proper theory upon
which to proceed is that of voluntary arbi
tration as the means of settling these diffi
le culties.
r. But I suggests that instead of arbitration
chosen in the jiat of conflicting claims, and
re after each dispute shall arise, for the purpose
. of determining the same, there be created
a commission of labor, consisting of th:et
Ot members, who shall be regular officers of the
1- government, charged am nig_ other duties
with the consideration and settlement, when
possible, of all controversies between labor
E and capital.
e. The suggestion was also made
or that the commission of labor should
of be made an annex of the present
a- bureau of labor. The beneficial
ye influence of the railway commission,
at which in many states are merely
it advisory has convinced Mr. Cleve
ct land ihat the same good results
tY would follow the creation of a fede
r. ral commission of arbitration.
er Many labor leaders and congress
at men are in favor of the proposed
er arbitration law, and it is believed
f that it would be so strongly backed
by public opinion that both employ
he ers and employed would gladly set
tle their distutes under it rather than
run the risk of a concflict between
c labor and capital with disastrous
e consequences to both sides.
At this time any peaceful experi
ment in the intesests of law and
re order with a view to the protection
of the rights of all classes of our
st people cannot fail to be very popu
Slar. When arbitration is fovored
by the government few citizens will
u- be selfish enough to oppose it. Ar
ad bitraitin and peace go hand in hantld,
Sand it cannot injure those who have
of a just cause.
- The Legislature has passed a law
of making a judicial district of Ver
million and Lafayette as formerly.

ce was a much needed change. As it
Id is, there is too much work for

Brutal Attaok by an O>Laet. sti
New Iberia Enterprise. de
On Sunday. morning last, betweent
the hours of t i and 12, while a large b
crowd of ladies, nmen and children, pý
were congregated at the depot, pt
awaiting the arrival of an excursion wl
train, police. officer Alex. Chargois,
advanced through the crowd, to wi
wlae young Louis Migues was
standing with two of his sisters and fol
some young lady friends. As he p
drew his watch to look at the time,
Chargois, with an imprecation, dealt
him a blow over the head with his
re
policeman's club felling the boy to of
the floor and continued the attack to
in a most brutal manner. One of st
Migues' sisters threw herself in the C
breach to protect her brother, and se
she was violently struck in the breast M
and thrown off. A number of by
standers interfered and prevented D
Chargois from doing further violence C
to his defenseless victim. Constable AJ
Paul Armandary arrested Chargois
and conducted him to Mayor Burke, T
who upon Chargois' own cognizance,
released him; but later, hearing the B
facts, promptly stripped him of his R
official insigna and suspended him.
Bad blood has existed for some time
past between Chargois and Migues J
and what led the former to select
the time and place that he did for F
such a display of ferocity is incom- T
prehensible. On Monday morning, F
Mayor Burke investigated the matter, F
and after a lengthy hearing, gave a
very severe lecture to the offender,
inflicted upon him a fine of $25 and
suspended him. Such conduct on
the part of a peace officer, makes
him unfit for such a responsible
position, and it is to be hoped that
public sentiment will assert itself and
demand the offender's prompt im- y
peachment. The conduct was an t
outraged upon the community. 1
Mrs. Alexander Dimnitry. t
Mrs. Mary Powell Mills Dimitry, 1
widow of Prof. Alexander Dimitry,
died at an early hour yesterday
morning at the residence of her
daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth D. Selph,
e on Orange street, in this city.
Mrs. Dimitry was born in Balti
more, Md. on the a sth of June,
x8x6, The venerable lady was of
e distinguished colonial ancestry in
three of the original thirteen colo
nists-Virginia, Pennsylvania and
South Carolina Among her Vir
ginia ancestors of the seventeel.th
d century were Col. Miles Cary of
a Warwick, Edward Jaquelin of
e Jamestown, and Augustine TWarner
A of "WVarner's Hall." She was the
daughter of Robert Mills, of Char
d leston, S. C., who from 1830 to
St x853 was United States government
architect at Washington D. C.
He designed, among other impor
n tant public works, the national
''- ashington monument at the capi
tal. Her mother was Eliza Barn
well Smith, daughter of Gen. John
- Smith, of ,,Hackwood." Frederick
county, Va., a Colonel in the Rev
" olutionary armyi, county lieutenant
of Frederick county in 1781, and
m from x80o to 18 i6 Representative
- in Congress from his district.
Prof. D)imitrv and Miss Mills
were married in Washington April
Id 5, 1835. From this marriage were
se born several sons and daughters,
including among the former John
B1. S. Dimitry, Charles Patton Dimi
s try and Thomas I). l)imitry, all of
=n whom reside in New Orleans. The
or late Mrs. Virginia D. Ruth was one
le of the daughters.
Mrs. l)imitry, whose death so
d many loving relatives and affection
at ate friends lament, was of a singu
al larly lovely nature and disposition.
n, WVithout guile herself she never, in
ly the courg of her long and honored
existence'on this earth, spoke or
- thought ill of any fellow-creature.
ts She surpassed in the impulses of a
e- true and simple charity of heart.
She fulfilled, as it seemed to those
who knew her best, the conception
s- of one whom men call "a saint."
d The object of her children's devoted
d love, their ideal of the good mother,
d the good wife, the good woman and
the pious Christian, they centered
all their affections in her. In her
t- venerable years her placid and
n smiling face radiated a blessing
n upon all who looked on it.

mented lady will be entombed
