THE WIDOWED MOTHER.
Recently, in one of the daily papers
appeared a letter from a widow, mak
ing a pitiful appeal for help.
In this letter was much food for
thought.
I want to call attention to the fact
that her case is not an exception, but
only a specimen of many. Have you
thought that her condition is only one
among hundreds. Aye, thousands, all
over this broad land of ours ? Women
who are left widows, with children,
and without means.
I feel like ‘‘stumping” the whole
of America, in their behalf, when I
think on the trials and sufferings of
these poor women who are left to bat
tle for bread, and are handicapped
with babies, thereby hindering her
from making a living for herself or
them.
Shouldn’t there be some provision
made for just such women?
To enable them to stay at home
with her little ones —to give them
proper care, and training, instead of
going out to work (if she is fortunate
enough to get work), leaving them to
the indifferent care of relatives, or
perhaps strangers.
Should she be fortunate enough to
get work, which gives her the privi
lege of being with them at night
(though many do not have that),
what then? Night is the time for
sleep and rest from daily cares. So
she does not have much of a chance
then.
She can not apply proper punish
ment, or correction then, for offenses
committed during the day. She doesn’t
feel like marring the very few hours
she is with them. So many mothers
have to go out to make the where
withal! to live. Thev have to have
their children in the care of persons
who are indifferent, or perhaps inca
pable of caring for them in the proper
way.
The children grow up without dis
cipline—like weeds, so to speak—
nothing done for them except to see
that they are fed and clothed. They
merely exist.
Now is that all that needs to be
done for children, the future citi
zens of the State? They miss the
best of what ought to be coming to
them, and the mother misses the
sweetest part of their life. If chil
dren don’t need mothers, pray what
a they need? 0, God, how they need
their mothers’
People prate about raising children
to be desirable citizens; who can do
this so well as mothers?
When children are left in the care
of those who take no special interest
in them, they are more than apt to
grow op with dispositions warped
—never being taught to control their
passions—and with the feeling that
the world in general has treated them
with injustice. All these together is
the making of criminals.
Those great philanthropists who
build and endow colleges and libra
ries for the rich and well-to-do (for
they are the only ones benefited by
them), would do well to “endow”
some of the poor widows and orphans.

care of humanity be first of all.
Although there are orphans’ homes,
etc., for children, what mother is
there who wishes to be separated from
her children? And no influence com
pares with a true Christian mother’s.
My idea is this:
The government should give a pen
sion to each deserving widow —those
who are left destitute. In that way,
they could manage to live happily
together with their little ones, and
When I shall meet God’s generous
dispensers
Os all the riches in the heavenly

Those lesser gods who act as recom
penses
For loneliness and loss upon this
shore,
Methinks abashed, and somewhat hesi
tating,
My soul its wish and longing will
declare
Lest they reply, “They are no boun
ties waiting;
We gave on earth your portion and
your share.”
Then shall I answer: “Yea, I do re
member

My June was always longer than
December;
My sun was always mightier than
my cloud.
My joy was ever deeper than my
sorrow,
My gain was ever greater than my
loss;
My yesterday seemed less than my to
morrow,
The crown looked always larger
than the cross.
“I have known love in all its radiant
splendor;
It shone upon my pathway to the
end.
I trod no road that did not bloom
with tender
And fragrant blossoms planted by
some friend.
And those material things we call
successes,
In modest measure crowned my
earthly lot.
Yet was there one sweet happiness
that blesses
The life of woman, which to me
came not.
not lose the sweet association and
kindred feeling of parent and child.
Then the asylums would not be so
crowded with insane women, and the
orphans’ homes so thronged with chil
dren.
What better suggestion can any one
make, than some appropriation for
widows and orphans to be together?
I just want to cite you to a condition
of affairs that is only too common.
The people of America ought to be
made alive to the situation is the

EDITORIAL NOTE.
It may interest all who read the
foregoing pathetic letter that Aus
tralia Has already legislated on behalf
of the widow who is left without the
means to care for her children. The
government simply pensions her, thus
enabling her to rear her children to
gether and at home. The unspeak
able cruelty of separating child from
mother, of scattering brothers and
sisters among make-shift orphanages,
“I knew the hope of motherhood. A
season
I felt a fluttering heart beat ’neat'h
my own,
A little cry—then silence. For this
reason
I dare to you my only wish make
known.
The babe who grew to angelhood in
heaven
I never watched unfold from child
to man,
And so I ask that unto me be given
That motherhood which was God’s
primal plan.
“All womankind he meant to share
its glories:
He meant us all to nurse our babes
to rest,
To croon them songs, and tell them
sleepy stories,
Else why the wonder of a woman’s
breast?
He must provide for all earth’s
cheated mothers
In his vast heavens of shining
sphere on sphere.
And with my son there must be many
others,
My spirit children, who will claim
me here.
“Fair creatures by my loving
thoughts created,
Too finely fashioned for a mortal
birth,
Between the borders of two worlds
they waited
Until they saw my spirit leave the
earth.
In God’s great nursery they must be
thronging?
To welcome me with many an in
fant wile. *
Now let me go and satisfy this long

To mother children for a little
while. ’ ’ —Harper’s.
of destroying the self respect of these
innocent young beings by making
them the objects of charity, is thus
abolished. If a poor widow and her
little ones were criminals, they could
not fare worse than is often the case
in our own land. It is simply not
possible, in hundreds of homes, for
a family to invest in life insurance
or to lay aside money for a rainy
day, and surely no greater work could
be done than to provide for such be
reaved mother and children when
their natural support is removed.
For all our exaltation of home, we
are far behind Australia in a sub
stantial recognition of it as the best
possible place in which to bring up
the future citizens. The pejorest home,
that is presided over by a good wo
man, is better than the richest, most
elaborately equipped institution;
whereas the struggling orphanages are
too often worse than failures in the
mental, moral and physical nurturing
of their inmates. There is no more
depressing picture than the spectacle
of little ones being dependent upon
haphazard donations, for which too
often they must suffer in real self
respect Uy being trotted out on exhi
bition to all sorts of visitors.
While a child owes a duty to its
parents, it is expected to fulfill every
obligation to the State; and there
fore there would be small real force
in the cry that might be raised against
such a “socialistic” scheme as pen
sioning widowed mothers in this coun
try. Upon women the State lays the
double burden of rearing as well as
bearing its citizens, and its soldiers
and when from legitimate, unavoid
able poverty they are faced with that
hardest of all problems,—supporting
their children, as well as training
them, their claims upon the State
would seem too just to be questioned.
Os course, Australia has had for
quite some time equal suffrage, which
may, or may not, explain its sensible
and humane view of this particular
question. It might be well for some
of our thoughtless, selfish women who
claim they have all the rights and
privileges they want, to think of the
condition they might be in, penniless
with a brood of children to feed and
clothe and educate. Wouldn’t most
of them welcome a wise provision that
let them stay at home and nurse their
babies, or look after their adventu
rous boys and girls, instead of driving
them into the business world to the
neglect of their children (a worn a j
simply can’t be bread winner and
home-keeper, too), or making them
dependent upon relatives, or institu
tional charity? I think they would.
Surely we all recognize that a child
ought to have the joint care of bot.'i
parents. Nature so ordained it, an 1
when it is half-orphaned iUis handi
capped just to that extent. Therefore
true regard for the welfare of the
State, if only put on the grounds of
economy would suggest that the lack
of a pittance be not allowed to make
the child a complete orphan! Not
withstanding the heroic examples of
noble widowhood, coming down from
the past, we must recognize the fact
that industrial conditions have chang
ed and the widow who must earn her
childrens’ livelihood often does so
while they are running the streets,
learning vice and crime. Formerly
the “widow woman” was shown
many substantial kindnesses from her
more prosperous neighbors—a share
of the harvest, a load of the fresh
chopped wood, meat in killing time —
and it is so yet, in country
districts. But even these are but
make-shifts, and in the cities and
towns utterly unknown.
There is indeed a “twilight zone”
in the life of a woman, when she is
