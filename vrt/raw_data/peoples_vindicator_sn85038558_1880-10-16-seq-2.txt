T Tu li(.in'ty of Iearlmrn and South Water I
ttre.:ts during the early hours of last evening c
was the Scene of an exciting struggle between f
life and death, and the heroic members of t
Engine (ompany No. 13 can with pride point f
to their work last night, whereby a father and
son were rescued from a horrible death by
sutoe ati n. The feeling in the large crowd
which had gathered was intense while the
struL.gle was uncertain, and when success I
canmlt the feeling burst forth Into "three B
Scheers for the brave firemen." t
, At the foot of Dearborn street, between
Souh Water street and the river, is a shaft
about sixty feet deep, where the gas-main is
c:rried under the river. It was the duty of
AliexzanI:" (; .w, an old man employed by the
(Gas C'oi:,.iy, to descend this shaft every
r second day and pump the water from the
B main. Yesterday about four o'chlok he
e went d)wn into the dark shaft as usual,
but did not wait long enough for the
accumulated gas to escape. While engaged
at work he was overcome by the gas
and fell half suffocated on the bottom.
It was fully 7:~0 before his absence was
t noticed, and then the alarm was sent to the
a house of No. 13 near by. The firemen turned
out with long ropes and lanterns. The condli
tion of the shaft was easily seen by the lan
S tern which went out when abut thirty feet
down. Meanwhile a son of the old man, James
William Gow, a young man of nineteen, had
e arrived at the shaft. A rope was tied around
8 his body, and, with a foreman named Shay,
h. be was lowered into the shaft. When the two
were about twenty feet front the bottom a
piercing cry was heard, and on pulling up, it I
was found that the boy had fallen from the I
a rope, and that shay was overcome with the gas.
i By this time alarge crowd had gathered, and
It intense excitement prevailed.
*e A daughter and two more sons had arrived
Is and were nearly erazy with grief. Meanwhile
e the suffocating groans of the father and son
‚Ä¢could be heard fromt the shaft. No light could
live ln the shaft, and the men were too weak- i
ened to grasp the ropes let down into the aw I
e ful darkness. It seemed as if they must per- I
0 lab, with hundreds of willing hands above to
help them, but not knowing how. The shaft
on the other side of the river was opened, and
this created a slight current of air. The' l:an
terns went down a little further, but the groans
were almost dying out. Another son atttempt
ed to reueau his father and brother, but he,
too, was brought up stitled.
Finally some one had a good idea. A calcium i
light was procured from the Olympic Theater ]
and its strong light was directed down the
shaft. Then the crowd could see the father
lying on his face, and his son with his face
turned upward-both apparently dead. Mak
nlg another test with the lanterns developed
n the fact that the shaft was beiugcletred o the
1 deadly escaping gas. Then was the time for I
k volunteers. There was a short silence, and
then Lieutenant Thomas l'umphry, of Comn
e pany No. 13, said: "I'll go." A rope was
fastened about him, and, putting a silk hand
kerchief itn his mouth, be rapidly descended
0 the ladder leading down the shaft. His mo
tions were watched eagerly. He fastened the
tope about the boy. The crowd pulled eager
. ly, and the unconscious boy was brought to
the upper world. Then the hero Pumphry I
made another trip and similarly brought up
the father. The son was easily brought to,
- and was found to have sustained but few in
1, Juries, comparatively. The case of the father
- was more dillicult. He had been four hoursin
the shaft and was absolutely tilled with gas.
. For a long time it was a struggle between life
and death. The firemen chafed his hands,
t slapped his hare feet, and partially restored
hint with cold water. Dr. Arndt finally atr
0 rived, and succeeded in reviving hint sulli
is Aiently to allow of the removal of the two to
their home, No. 11 Kinzie street.

A Fatal Laudslip.
Is the northern part of Bengal Is a cool aad
a sequestered resort called Naina Tal. It is
le perched up among the hills and has long been
a special refuge during the stifling heats of the
Hindostan summer for Englishmen of both
'e the etvil and military service. Many such
1- residents have been wont to fy with their
he families on the approach of the parching
m weather of the extrem3 season and to lhnd an
. asylum in the moist shades of Nailna Tal. A
et onsiderable mountain stream passes the spot
Ot n its course toward the plains, and n beauti
ful lake tempers the atmosphere hard by.
At Nains Tal some of the most romantic epi
se modes of Indian life have had their beginning
* and their end, and more than one novelist has
I- chosen the place as a scene for ploturesque
is incident and description. Such are some of
the associations of Naina Tal's past; but that
it its history will be embellished by similar pa
ages in the future is scarcely probable. The
b, village, as we Just learn bytelegraph, hasbeen
a, absolutely overwhelmed; and it is even likely,
.- If fears now expressed are confirmed, that
r Nalna Tal will be obliterated from the face of
Sthe earth.
The fate that has come upon this remote
B engal settlement, while a rare one, is by no
means without precedent. A memorable oc
ample has been known in this country, and
l the atune of Francania suggests its sad par
- ticulars. There is some likeness between the
two eases. But instead of lying at the foot of
one or two mnountaltins Naina TaIl was st'
rour.,l by them. It might be described as
lyiug in a cup or basin; and was liable from Its
, topbgritaphical pwsition to sudden inundation.
Itrasdue, no doubt, to a great rusheo
Swater that Naiuta Tal was destroyed. But the

ty tion. it appears that rain began failling heavi
ofly there, as we read the dispatches, ont last

afternoon. The gtuge by that time showed a
rulnfall of twenty-ilve inches in forty hours.

Most readers are familiar with the
story of Flora Macdonald's heroic rescue aI
of Prince Charles Edward, but there are soi
few who associate her with our Revolu
tionary War. The following extract is to
from Amelia E. Barr's interesting arti- at
cle entitled "A Romance of the Hebri in
des," in Harper's .Magazine: the
On her return to Skye she was mar- ne
ried to young Macdonald of Kingsburgh,
and on the death of his father became pr
the lady of Kingsburl~h. But the estate f
was greatly impoverished by war, fines mi
and unstinted hospitality, and when all idi
hopes of the Stuarts' return had been wn
abandoned, Flora and her husband re
solved to emigrate to the Carolinas. It be
was at this time they had a visit from ,r
Dr. Johnson, and it was very amusing
to find Flora writing to a friend two
weeks before it, saying, "1 am expect- he
ing from the mainland Mr. Boswell, and on
one Mr. Johnson, a gay young English he
buck, with him." ch
The Macdonalds settled near Halifax, th
in North Carolina, and seem to have
been regarded as the head of a large
Scotch emiration scattered around that
vicinity. l5nfortunately the Revolution- wi
ary War broke out before they had be- s.
come attached to their new home, and c
Macdonald, who had given his alle- s
giance to the house of Hanover when de
Charles's cause became dead and hope- l
less, transferred with it the rigid loyalty "w
that had been so marked a character- th
istic of his race. A soldier of a long
line of soldiers, and an intense partisan
of loyalty, he was quite unable to sym
pathize with republican ideas, or to see t
any reason in popular rights. co
lie raised first the royal or Tory th
standard in the Carolinas, and, it is of
said, was urged into active warfare by at
his wife. A regiment of Highlanders, pc
known as the Eighty-fourth, was at
formed, Flora's husband being its Wi
Colonel, and her eldest son, a lad of six- IP
teen, one of its Captains. The first wI
light between it and the colonists took sti
place at Moore's Creek, February 27, s
1776. Early at daybreak the shrill at
notes of the bagpipes called the High- to
lantimen to battle, but Macdonald was in
seriously ill, and hadl to depute the com- TI
mand to Macleod and Campbell. Both WI
were kille. .t the very first onset, and b3
the battle-which was the initial one of
the Revolution in North Carolina-was p1
r a brilliant victory for the colonists under m
G Cenerals Moore and Caswell. oi
After the battle of Moore's Creek, in
Flora's husband remained some time a 1k
prisoner in Halifax Jail, and on his re- he
lease served with his regiment in Cana- at
da. During these years Flora endured in
many hardships, and at the close of bl
the war General Macdonald retired on or
half-pay, and they returned to their pt
P home in the barren, cloudy mountains of
of Skye. lii
Their homeward journey was not un- at
Seventful. They were attacked by a w
French privateer, and a severe conflict w
took place. Flora remained on deck fe
during the whole battle, succoring and
stimulating the sailors by her heroic
speeches and behavior. Her foot slip
- ped in the blood which covered the
s deck, and she fell and broke her arm; di
but not even this calamity induced her hi
to leave the scene until.satisfied.that her th
services were no longer needed. in
She rejoiced greatly to be once again in
in the wild desolate freedom of the B
1 Hebrides, and she never more left them. ti
As a wife she had shared all her hus- tr
band's dangers and labors; as a mother w
she strove with a passionate earnestness bi
to make her five sons worthy of their ni
illustrious name. Every one of them fr
Sbecame soldiers. Charles, the eldest, al
Swas a Captain in the Queen's Rangers. tr
"a There lies the most finshed gentle- qi
' man of my family and name,j said di
-Lord Macdonald, when he saw him t
lowered into the grave. Alexander, tl
also ia oilcer, was lost at sea. The a
Sthird son, Ranald, famous for his hand. st
some person and elegant manners, had ti
a professional character equal to his it
personal one, and was a Captain of ma- it
- rines; James was an officer in the Brit- h
0ish Legion; and John, the youngest, 8
rose to the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. I
Flota retained to the last her beauty, fi
Shervivacity,and her spirit. She diedl n
on the 6th of March, 1700, at the age of p
seven years. Her wlindingsheet was i
actai one of those in which Prince F
:- Charles had slept % Kingsburghl.
A Pretty StMl.
r In Naples the papers tell avery pretty i
S.toryof theQueenofItaly. It appears F
a that asshewasdrivingtotheroa wood i
s of Lincalo the coachman mistook the
Sroad, and one of the gentlemen asked a
Scountryman the way. The man, seeing
the fine carriage and horses, and the
servants' livery, and all gay company,
Sthought he was being fooled. ,"As if
, you did not know!" he said, with a bi
Sgrin. The Queen rghed, and asmu d
a him that they were lost,. Then only did
* the countryman condescend to point out
r the way, after which he walked off as f
fearing to be laughed at again.
S"Give him twenty frarca for his
trouble," add the Queena to one of her
t escort, who going after the constryman
, said to him: "Here, my man, is a little
, present from the QueenM of Italy, who
thanks you."
"The Queen!" ried the countryman,
Sreturninlg to the carriage. "Forgiveme
that I dil not know thee. But I had
e never seen thee before. Thouen art as
r beautiful as a May rose. God bless
a thee." And the carriage drove off.
o Now the countryman, who had once
id seen the Queen, wanted to see her pretty
o face again, and the following day he
presented himself at the palace.
" know her, von know," he added
a mysterously. 'I spoke to her yester
,g day, and I want to speak to her again."
n Think"ng he had to doawith a mad

S"Bring him here,by all means," was

SWhen the man was, for the second

the four metals distinguished as capable to
s of being hardened to spring temper, h:
and in t~at state possessing more or less w
power of vibration-steel, brass, nickel hi
and gold-none equals gold, if combined p
with copper or silver, for ductility and lil
power of vibration. An experiment
was made in the use of gold wire for the h
strings of the piano with marked re- cr
suits. Not only was the tone consider- tlh
1 ably increased, but its quality was ma- is
terially improved. It has also been used N
in other instruments with equal success. w
The extra expense can hardly be th
weighed against the advantages gained h(
by its use. al

has been made,. while the young shoots fr
are used in the spring by some people 'h
d instead of asparagus, which they resem- w
if ble in flavor." It forgets the chief use,
or abuse, to which the milk-weed can be w
r put. The earliest Sanskrit Vedas tell us a
as of the famous soma drink, the water of 1
life, which gave immortality to the gods i

3 Electrical sltorms.
TtsE narrow escape which the Cathe
dral of Notre Dame in Paris recently
had from destruction by lightning, and
r the unusual frequency of thunder storms
in various parts of Europe, are attract
n ing attention. During the summer the
e British isles have suffered severely, and
the hail, which often accompanies elec
. trical disturbances, has played sad havoc
r with the kitchen gardens in the neigh
, borhood of London, and with the glass g
r under which the rarer kinds of flowers, h
Sfruits, and vegetables are grown. From
all parts of France come reports of ex
traordinary disturbances, and earth
quakes have been remarkably frequent
Sduring the present year. Unfortunately
Sthe damaes have not been confined to
, the vegetable kfngdom. An electrician
Swho has published a book on electric
. storms and the best method of averting
4 their dangers gives some figures show
ing the loss of life caused by lightning
in-Europe and Russia. During the first
Shalf of the l4st decade 1,4.52 men and
, 818 women were klulled, and 4,092 con.
f. agrations took place. In Prussia,
Sfrom 1869 to 1877, 1,004 deaths by light
lnin occurred. In Austria, during a
perid of eight years, 1,700 lives were
s Ist,and 40,000 fires were cased. The
French have suffered less from the
" bolts from heaven," for in the last ten
years only 880 have been killed by light
ning, of whom 248 were women. The
English returns are incomplete, but it
is estimated that on an average 100
nihmen are killed every yearby
. The almost total nj t of
Sthe use lightningrods in Eng and is
remarkable. This carelessness seems
Sthe more reprehensible when the words
of Fuller, the church historian, are
called to mind. In 1665 he wrote:
I"There was scarce a great abbey in
SEngland which at last was not burned
d down by lightning from Heaven." Yet
at the present time St. Paul's alone, of
all the public edifices in the United
Kingdom, is thoroughly proteeted. Many
of the lofty spires of the cathredals have
no conductors at all, and not one of
Sthem is safe. Several parts of Windsor
Castle, which from its exposed situation
Sis particularly liable to be struck, are
unprovided With lightning-rods.-New

A Water Telescape.
SAcconoDio to Land and Wafer the
Norwegian fishermen always carry
with them on their expeditions a kind of
telescope called a water telescope. This
is a tube three or four feet long, with an
eye piece atone end. The other end,
which is opon, is placed in the water
over the ed of the boat, and a little
practice easly enables the observer to
diustinguish objects at a depth of from
hten to fifteen fathops. Tle fishermen
Sare thus enabled to discover shoals
Swhich would otherwise 0. unnoticed.
They then give the signal, thei* com.
Srades surround them with seines, and
Sthey frequently make wonderful hauls
' in places and under circumstances that
Swould never have been suspected but
for the use of the telescope. AMr. Frank
Buckland recommends the instrument
to the English and Scotch herring fishers.
