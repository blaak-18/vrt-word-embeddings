Men Lost Their Lives.
Atlanta, Ga., Feb. 1g.-Following
Monday's storm of rain, sleet and

severest weather of the winter, held I
the south Atlantic and gulf states in

The sudden drop in the temperatu

high winds, which caused serious dam

responsible for reported loss of life.
The wind storm in this city during
Monday night reached the velocity of
sixty miles an hour, breaking all rec- I
ords of the weather bureau. In other
towns throughout this state -heavy loss
was caused by wind, which assumed
the proportions of a blizzard in some 1
communities.
At Bowman, a small station on the
Southern railway, a great portion of
Ih town was blown away, several
buildings being destroyed.
General storms in that section crip
pled all telegraphic and telephone l
communications, so that the lown of I
fWe and property cannot be estimated.
At Macon, Ga., the wind storm al
most reached a hurricane and dam
aged telegraph lines, the wind blowing
t the rats of sity miles an hour.
At Savannah, Ga., Monday night the
ined teached the rate of fifty-two
a siep-un hour, though all shipping es
injury. The rainfall at Atlanta
was recorded at 1.4 inches. At
