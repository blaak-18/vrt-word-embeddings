ed o you have had a fhil and complete
trial, preparing land for seeding, barrini
of ead dirting corn and ootton. The
perfect and efeetual work done, antr
thoroagh pulverizing of the oiell, advc
eates for them aperiority over all other
implements of the kind ever introduced
here; the more they ae used, the more
satisfaction they give. One man with
an ordinary pair of male, having to
drive down a row but onoe.'aseultivate
from 6 to 8 seere a day, and their intro
duction will prove to be of inestimable
value.
