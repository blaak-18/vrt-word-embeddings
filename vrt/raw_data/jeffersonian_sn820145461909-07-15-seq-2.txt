O ONE in the least acquainted
with a certain district of Ar
kansas will ever go to “Nub
bin Ridge” expecting to find
N
rich meadows, fine cattle, educated
people or attractive farm-houses.
“Nubbin Ridge” is a broad and rug
ged backbone, humped up, it seems,
in an eternal attitude of contem
plated violence, not to be wholly
dissociated from a mule in the act of
throwing its rider. The people, like
the soil, are poor; and again, like
the soil, they utter no complaint
against a condition which they fancy
nature intentionally enjoined upon
them. They argue, with a philoso
phy which wise men might admire,
that so long as there is plenty “uv
haug an’ hom’ny” in the house dis
content should not be permitted to
cross the threshold.
Anderson Petticord was, doubtless,
the most prosperous farmer on “Nub
bin Ridge.” He was a small, “dried
up” old man, with a wheeze that had
gained for him the nickname of “Old
Quinzy.” His wife was a fleshy,
round-faced, talkative woman, but
she was known to be one of the
“stirrin’est critters” on the Ridge.
Millie Petticord, the only offspring of
a long union, was called the “put
tiest” girl in the neighborhood. Her
rich plenitude of hazelnut-colored
hair, her brown eyes, clear complex
ion and graceful form made her an
object of such general admiration
that Sim Bumpus, the acknowledged
wit of the ridge, often declared that
she was the “puttiest thing he ever
seed ’cept a colt.”
A conspicuous member of the Pet
ticord family was Big Lige Brad
shaw. Six feet four inches would
scarcely give a correct idea of the
height of Big Lige. His movements
reminded one of the gentle running
of a powerful piece of machinery.
His hair was coarse and dark, but
his chin and cheeks were covered
with a short growth of reddish beard.
During many years he had worked
for Petticord, and he seemed to have
no ambition except to perform the
work of two ordinary men. He had
but little to say. Sometimes, in the
winter, when he had brought in the
wood for the night and had built a
great log fire, he would sit during
the entire evening, shelling corn or
making shuck collars for the work
horses. When he laughed, which was
rare, he laughed with a hearty roar,
and when he did have anything to
say he said it with a directness of ex
pression 'which many educated men
have failed to command.
“Big Lige, is thar much uv a frost
this mawnin’?” old man Petticord
asked one morning when the giant
came in from the stable. The day
for hog-killing had arrived, and the
family, having arisen before day
light, sat by the fire in the sitting
room, waiting for the arrival of the
neighbors who were to assist in the
slaughter.
“Yes,” Lige replied.
“A reg’lar killin’ frost?”
“A reg’lar dead’ner.”
“That’s good, fur ’long towards
midnight I wuz afeard the weather
BIG LIGE OPIE \ EED
wuz goin’ to turn warm. It would be
a powerful slam on us es the meat
wuz ter spile. Whut air yer fun
tering airter?” the old man added,
turning to his wife, who, in attempt
ing to reach up after something, had
fallen against his chair.
“I wanter git that old bonnet.
Don’t yer see whut I am airter?”
“Wall, whut made yer hang it so
high?” he replied with a wheeze.
“Tromp er body to death er retchin’
roun’ airter yer dtids. Fur the
Lord’s sake set down an’ rest yerself.
Yer commence ter stir, stir, stir as
soon as yer git up uv er mornin’, an’
it’s stir, stir, stir tell yer lay down
at night.”
“Fur goodness’ sake, pap, don’t
fuss. A body has ter stir roun’ some
little, I reckon.”
“Wall, wall, don’t let us argy.
Millie!”
“Yas, sur.”
“Ain’t yer er noddin’ thar?”
“I reckon I wuz,” the girl ac
knowledged.
“Wall, don’t nod.”
“I kain’t he’p it, pap, fur I’m a
sleepy. I hadn’t mor’n got in bed, it
’peared like, ’fore you called me ter
git up.”
“Wall, wall, that’ll do, but don’t
let us have no noddin’. Big Lige,
whut’ll the white sow weigh?”
“Four fifty.”
“Yas, every ounce uv it.” The old
man got up, went to the door, looked
out, and said:
“No daylight nowhar yit. Did the
Dye boys say they wuz a-comin’, Big
Lige?”
“Yas, and Jim Polk Brezentine
said he wuz a-comin’.”
Millie looked up. The old man
turned from the door, resumed his
seat, and said:
“I don’t know whut good Jim Polk
Brezentine ken do at a hang-killin’.
A man that’s been a school-teacher
an’ a member uv the legislature ain’t
much force at a haug-killin’, I’m
a-thinkin’.”
“He can tote water, I reckon,”
Lige replied.
“Don’t you pester yerself about
Jim Polk Brezentine, Big Lige,” Mrs.
Petticord said in a voice of sharp re
proof. “Tote water, indeed! I don’t
reckon that he has ter tote water.
Do you hear that, Big Lige?”
“ Yessum.”
“Wall, wall,” interposed the old
man, “don’t let us jower this mawn
in’. ’Pears like the whole kit an’
bilin’ uv yer air gone wrong. Mil
lie!”
“Yas, pap.”
“Ain’t yer er noddin’ agin?”
“No, pap.”
“Wall, put the breakfus’ on the
table an’ let us have er bite ter eat
agin the folks comes, es they air
cornin’.”
Millie promptly obeyed, and a few
moments later, by the light of the
stone lamp, the breakfast was served.
“Git out, will yer?” exclaimed the
old man as he violently thrust one
foot under the table. “It does seem
that the dogs will take the place.
W’y, maw,” addressing his wife, “this
ain’t our dog! Wall, I wish I may
die es yander ain’t Scott Patterson,
Xsl)e "Jeffersonian
an’ Sallie, too. Draw up, fur we air
waitin’ fur yer.”
“No,” said Patterson, as he enter
ed and leaned a long rifle against
the wall. “We’ve done eat.”
Millie jumped up and brought a
chair for Sallie, Scott Patterson’s sis
ter. Scott was almost as slim as his
rifle, and Sallie —well, Sallie was not
handsome. Her face was pale, her
features were pinched, and her eyes
were small. She, in observance of
“Nubbin Ridge” custom, wore a
homespun dress and a gingham sun
bonnet. She never lost an opportu
nity of visiting the Petticords, for she
had, long ago, cast an eye of matri
monial longing upon Big Lige.
“Scott,” said Petticord, “I see
you’ve come prepar’d to do the
shootin’.”
“Yas, I alius do that.”
“Wall, rickerleck that it puts the
whisky on yer every time yer make
a haug squeal.”
“Lemme tell yer, ole Quinzy: Es
you don’t get a drink tell Scott Pat
terson shoots a haug an’ don’t drap
him in his tracks, yer’ll be goin’
roun’ powerful dry.”
“That’s what I know, Scott. Who’s
that a singin’? It’s the Dye boys.
Big Lige, go down an’ see es the
fire’s all right. Hurry up; they’ve
all come.”
“I’ll go with yer, Big Lige,” said
Sallie Patterson.
“Come on, then,” Lige replied.
The growling and snapping of dogs
in the yard, the tramping of horses
at the gate—shouting, laughter and
good-humored bantering heralded
the arrival of the neighbors. There
was ’Squire Boyle, justice of the
peace; the Dye boys, and especially
there was Jim Polk Brezentine; but
above all, perhaps, there was Sim
Bumpus, the wit. Brezentine, who,
as Big Lige once remarked, “had got
jest ernuff edycation ter make him
triflin’,” was a sort of dandy. He
wore his hat on one side of his head,
and he took particular care that the
legs of his brown jeans trousers
should not hide the red shoe-strings
in the yellow tops of his boots. He
was a favorite among the young
women, for he could take up a book
“an’ read it off jes’ like talkin’.”
The wit was of that peculiar type
never seen in any part of the coun
try where the railway engine rushes
like a storm of civilization. Yellow
hair, a head like a pineapple cheese,
eyes of butter-milk hue, a grin tnat
sought not much-needed rest —all to
gether describe, as nearly as possible,
the type of manhood represented by
Mr. Sim Bumpus.
Sallie accompanied Lige to a small
pond near which a large log fire had
been made.
“Thte fire’s all right, Big Lige.”
“Yas, an’ the rocks’ll soon be hot
ernuff to put in the water an’ heat
it.”
“Why wouldn’t it be jest as good
ter bile the water ’stead o’ heatin’ it
with hot rocks, Big Lige?”
“’Cause the seedyment from the
rocks makes the haug’s ha’r come off
easier.”
“I didn’t think uv that. Yer know
everything, it ’pears ter me.”
Lige threw back his enormous
head and laughed. “Know ever’-
thing!” he said. “W’y, Sallie, I
don’t know nothin’. I know jest
about ernuff to keep outen hot water,
an’ that’s all.”
“Wall, that’s a good ’eal, fur I
know uv folks that’s in hot water
nearly all the time. Do yer know
what’s a sack? Millie’s in love with
Jim Polk Brezentine.”
Big Lige had taken up a handspike
and was endeavoring to turn over a
burning log. He dropped the hand
spike -when Sallie made the remark,
and, with a pretense of shielding his
face from the heat, raised one arm
and hid his eyes.
“You may not believe it, but it’s
so,” the girl continued. “It’s awful
nice ter love somebody. I ought to
know. Why don’t you ask me how I
know, Big Lige?”
“How do you know?” he asked,
as he picked up the handspike and
leaned upon it.
“’Cause I love somebody. Folks
says he’s big an’ ugly, but I don’t
think so.”
Lige threw down the handspike,
turned to Sallie, and said:
“I’ve got ter go ter the house now
an’ fetch down the tubs.”
“No; let’s wait here tell the folks
come. Thar’s ernuff uv them ter
fetch the tubs. Yer air alius a pes
terin’ y’urself thinkin’ that somebody
else’ll have somethin’ to do. This is
all mighty well when thar ain’t no
body roun’ but wimin folks, but it’s
all foolishness when the woods is full
o’ men.”
“Whut you say, Sallie, may be
true, but I’ve got ter go an’ fetch the
tubs.” <
“Well, go on, then, Mr. Smarty.”
A beautiful day had dawned, but
to Big Lige it was a day of sadness.
He had long suspected that Millie
loved Brezentine, but now he knew
it, not particularly because Sallie had
said so, but because he had seen on
Millie’s face an expression of pleas
ure when Mrs. Petticord defended
Brezentine against the insinuation
that he could at least be utilized as
a water-carrier; but at no time duiSr
ing the day did Lige permit any one
to look into his heart and see a
shrouded hope lying there. Once,
and only once, did he say anything
that might have been construed to
hold a meaning deeper than that of
a passing remark. He had just
tliiown down a heavy hog when §im
Bumpus said:
“I tell you whut; some men can
tote heavy loads on the’r shoulders.”
“Yas,” Lige replied, “an’ some men
can tote heavier loads on the’r
hearts.”
“Yer never toted a heavy load on
yer heart, did yer, Big Lige?”
’Squire Boyle asked, as he took up a
hoe and began to stir up the steam
ing fragments of rock in the scald
ing-box.
“Oh, no, ’squire. It ain’t calc’lated
that some folks has got hearts.”
“Hearts don’t ermount ter much
lessen they’re trumps,” Mr. Bumpus
suggested. The men—all but Big
Lige—laughed, and Sim was so well
pleased that he sought an early op
