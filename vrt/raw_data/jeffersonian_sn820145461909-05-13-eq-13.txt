Jeffersonian Post Card Club
This is an oft week, as the jokes
played out, and we did not want to
spoil the comments on “Girls” and
“Boys” by running them piecemeal.
We have received some good letters
from boys, telling us what they think
about girls, and a few from the girls
speaking in very decided words about
the boys. Next week we will pick out

It will instantly be seen by a glance
at this table that cotton goods of all
kinds are to have increased protec
tion; wool and all its manufactured
products to remain the same, and
silks (under which classification come
all the artificial fabrics which have
practically supplanted real silk goods)
to be heavily taxed. Thus nearly ev
ery garment or piece of household
linen or furnishing will cost more,
instead of less. While the increase
on silk goods looks, upon its face, to
be a tax upon a luxury, it must be
remembered that mercerized cotton
fabrics produced at comparatively
small expense, will masquerade as silk
and bring enormous returns to the
manufacturer.
T'he slight suggested decrease in
metals and in wood is a bagatelle. Ar
tificial products and provisions are to
cost more. Agricultural products and

provisions are to cost more. Under
these two classifications necessarily
comes everything in the nature of
food. Pulp paper and books are to
cost more. This last has aptly been
a “tax upon intelligence.”
The tariff is a tiresome subject, and
we are sick of having it harped upon
in all the papers and magazines. And
yet, if we were directly overcharged
five cents on some trifle we bought,
we would raise a row and say we
didn’t care for the nickel, but the
principle of the thing made us mad,
etc., etc,, world without end. Still
the voice of the consumer is practi
cally unheard when millions of dol
lars are to be extorted through out
rageous tariff charges.
What does a Republican Senate and
Congress care for the threat that the
“tariff’’ will be made an issue four
years hence? If they can have four
years more of undisturbed stealing,
that is enough “easy street” to be
worth while for the present.
The United States Supreme Court
has recently decided that the Com-
Commodities
Clause.
Law is Constitutional, reversing the
decision of the United States Supreme
Court of the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. The Hepburn act
makes it unlawful “for any railroad
company to transport from any state
to any other state or any foreign
country any article commodity, other
than timber, manufactured, mined or
produced by it, under its authority,
or which it may own in whole or in
part, or in which it may have interest

Interstate Commerce act
of 1906, known as the
Hepburn Railroad Rate
direct or indirect, except such arti
cles or commodities as may be neces
sary and intended for its use in the
conduct of its business as a common
carrier. ”
The Supreme Court permits the
railroads to own stock in coal mines
which thus renders it comparatively
easy for the railroads to do lawfully
by methods of indirection, that which
they could not do lawfully through di
rect ownership of the mines.
The Commodities Clause, therefore,
while sustained in letter, has failed in
spirit.
While one can understand the tre
mendous power the railroads would
have to discriminate in the matter of
transportation, as between its own
mines and those in which it was not
interested, yet the original decision
of Judge Gray that the clause was
“unreasonable” seems not unsound.
Pennsylvania is a coal country, there
fore the clause applied to transporta
tion of the products of coal mines
and specifically excepted timber.
Suppose Boston and Maine had
been the railroad affected instead of
the Delaware and Hudson, the Erie,
New York Central, and so forth?
Then the clause would probably have
excepted coal and been leveled against
ownership by railroads of timber or
timber lands. It is difficult to see a
broad constructive principle in the
Hepburn Clause such as the legitimate
control of corporations should imply.
OUR AGENTS’ CONTEST.
Don’t forget that this contest closes
on June 10th, and that you have now
only four weeks in which to win the
prize. Each agent receives his regu
lar commission on all subscriptions,
and in addition to that we offer fif
teen dollars in two prizes—five and
ten dollars. We want to suggest to
the younger members of the family
that it. is an easy matter to get sub
scriptions for the Jeffersonians, and
that it costs nothing at all to try. We
supply you with samples, blanks and
receipts, and there is hardly a town
or village in the South where an
hour’s work will not bring you two or
three subscribers. Ladies, as a rule,
are very successful subscription can
vassers. Some of our lady agents
pick up a nice little sum of pin money
each month by canvassing among
their friends. Write to us for sam
ples, and try the work for a week.
You will be surprised at the results,
and the dollars that you earn at odd
times will come in very handy dur
ing the dull times of summer.

(And this is particularly the time
when the sons and daughters need
