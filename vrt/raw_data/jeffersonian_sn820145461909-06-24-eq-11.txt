OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Watch out next week for the let
ters on “What I Hope To Be.” If
you want to win a prize in these com
petitions, you must write neat let
ters, and you must say something
worth while. Don’t be parrots; use
your heads. The “Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table” said: “I like these
bulbous-headed fellows, the kind that
steam well when they work.” Now
go ahead, and steam well.
WHAT HE ’SPISHUNED.
I am a little boy, 11 years old. My
pa is dead. Mama and I and little
brother and sister live with grandpa.
He takes both of the Jeffersonians,
and I enjoy reading them. Here is
my story:
Once in the days of slavery, two
negroes, Pete and Sambo, were trav
eling along the public highway, when
they met an Italian carrying a crank
organ, accompanied by a monkey.
The Italian unstrapped his instru
ment, set it down, and commenced
grinding the darkies a tune. It was
the first monkey that the two ne
groes had ever seen, and when he
began dancing, Sam says to Pete, “I
spishun sompen.” “What you spish
un, Sam?” “Well, I spishun this
gemman a-dancin’ is a cross between
a nigger and a coon.”—Roy Morris,
Plano, Ala.
BOYS HAVE FUNNY WAYS.
I am a little country girl, 12 years
old. I think the boys, with their
funny ways, ought to pick up their
things, and not throw them about. I
think they ought to work for both
Jeffersonians. If more boys were
like Tom Watson, this country would
be in a better fix; that’s what I
think about it.—Blanche Young,
Quitman, Ga.
DO YOUR BEST, BOYS.
I am a little girl, 11 years old.
Here is what I have to say about boys:
Boys are the mainstay of the world,
if they would only do their best.
What happiness boys would bring
if they would never drink, tell a lie,
steal, nor curse; and above all be
Christian boys. What would be no
bler?—Eva Sloan, Hartsfield, Ga.
PROUD OF HER CARDS.
Here I come again. I won the
second prize once before, but I did
not expect it. I was surprised at first,
but lam proud of my cards. I think
the Post-Card Club is a fine thing.
I like to read the letters. I read
them every week. My school is out
now. lam 12 years old.—Ruth Em
ory, Gabbettville, Ga.
A BILL VILLE BOY.
I will send in a little joke. “That
boy of mine,” said a Billville farmer,
“beats my time. Every time I quote
Scripter to him, he is always throw
ing it back at me. Today I told him
to take up the hoe and follow the
furrow; thar’s gold in the land, I
said. After a time he come back at
me: ‘Father, I don’t keer if thar is
gold in the land, I laid up a treasure
in heaven.’ ” —Leila Lackey, 13 years
old, Bodga, Miss.
Dl>e. TJ&ffersonian
WHO ARE YOU?
This post-card came from Lindale,
Ga. Won’t “Blue-Eyes” write again
and tell us who she is?
Just a word about boys. I think
they are the nicest beings on earth.
What would girls do without them?
How would they get to parties, and
what would they have to discuss?
Think of that, girls. May all boys
grow up to be as good as Mr. Wat
son.—“Blue-Eyes.”
PEACHES AND PEACH BASKETS.
Some girls are very bad, and some
are not. I don’t guess you think a
10-year-old boy knows about the
rats, puffs, curls and tangles in a
girl’s hair, and the cheeks that are
made rosy from the use of paint and
powder. The girls and boys are
about the same in expenses. The
girls have to have bows, all kinds of
dresses, and those horrid-looking so
called peach baskets. It is astonish
ing to see the style of dress nowa
days, but some girls deserve all they
get, because they have to work very
hard, while others sit upon the piano
stool all day long, or bother their
next-door neighbors.—Goodrich Ly
on, 10 years old, Pine Bluff, Ark.
LABEL THEM.
I think some girls are very pretty,
while others have false complexions.
Those with false complexions ought
to be labeled, the same as the Pure
Food Law requires all food to be
labeled. Some girls are timid, while
there are some good girls. All aunts,
mothers and grandmothers were once
girls. Girls like fun and frolic.
Some will allow a drunken boy to
go with them; that is too bad!
Cole Savage, 14 years old, Kennedy,
Ala.
USEFUL, AFTER ALL.
Boys are the brothers of girls.
Some boys are very nice, and some
are very naughty. Boys should above
everything respect their mothers,
fathers and sisters. When a boy gets
into his teens he wants to dike up and
go to see a girl and treat her to
cream and candy. But he never
treats his sisters to cream and candy.
We musn’t be too hard on boys, for
they are useful, after all.—Aleen Mc-
Arthur, 13 years old, Bluff Springs,
Fla.
ALL KINDS OF GIRLS.
Some girls are pretty; others are
ugly, and don’t take enough exercise.
They are fond of new clothes. Some
girls, when asked to go to bed, puck
er up their pretty lips, and then they
do begin: “Oh, me! all the rest sit
up late, and why can’t I?” Another
little girl, with curly pate, says when
she’s a grown-up girl, she’ll sit up
late. That’s just the way they do.—
Walter W. Stancil, 12 years old, Sale
City, Ga.
She—Hadn’t we better do the wa
ter-color room?
He —That’s the way to the tea
place, ain’t it? Well, I don’t feel
like it just yet.—Punch.
