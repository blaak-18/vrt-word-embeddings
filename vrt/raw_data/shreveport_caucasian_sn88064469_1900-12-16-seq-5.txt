asked, "Who will give me a gift, for I Am
poor" All three denied her; but another
who esat near, unwashed, unstained with
fruit, gave her I gift and satisled the
poor woman. And then she asked them
Iwhat was the dispute, and they told and
lifted up before her their hands. "Beauti
ful, indeed," said she, whea she saw them.
But when they asked her which was the
most beautiful, she said: "It is not the
hand that is washed clean in the brook. It
is not thD hand that is tipped in red, it is
not the hand garlanded with fragrant low
ers, but it is the hand that gives to the
poor that is most beauriful." As she

said Mr Latta, the genial, courteous
and obliging manager of Leon M
Carter, jeweler, one of the grande*
most attractive and complete estab

"Let well enough alone" U signifieant
and so is the compliment to the Can

the ad of this deservedly popular firm
which is strictly reliable and the
leader in jewelry in this city. To be
too busy to write an ad to replace an
ad, which is considered a good steady
drawer of business is a credit to the
good j udgm Ã½nt of Mr Letts. It is
no wonder the magnificent store of

there was! It was your day, and the
"grown ups" felt It was so and for

the beautiful anthems, and when that

myriad of pink and white parcels
weighing down its green boughs, can

"Ah, yes; tha5 Is Christmas in the
home!" I hear a girl say. "But I'm
studying art in a strange city, strug
gling to win fame in a solitary studio,
and Christmas is the loneliest day in
the year for me." Your own fault, I
answer. You can't have the home at
mosphere, true, but why can't you
give it to some one else? Somewhere
in the great city there is a little child
who is as lonely as you are, and no
child has any business to be lonely on
Christmas day. Go out in the streets
and find toat little "raif. You will see
him skulking around the brilliantly
lighted shop windows, staring with all
his eyes at the splendor within, won- I

by a miracle some one of those candies
or those glittering toys may be his.
The days of miracles are not past. You
can operate one yourself. You can in
vite him and a couple of his fellows to
your desolate studio. He will probably
think it the most beautiful place he has
ever seen if you decorate it with ever
greens and soft lights and have a small
Christmas tree standing in the corner
with a few goodies and inexpensive
trifles upo#it. And if the spirit of
Christmastide does cot steal Into your
heart as you watch the delight on the
small faces of these little outcasts then
you are beyond feeling the true joy of
Christmas-the joy of giving.

sign of trailing flowers, among them
calla lilies made of chiffon, and all the
leaves are made in the same way, so'
that out of the chiffon there have bloom
ed these pure and lovely flowers. They
look as if swimming on the surface of
the water. Chiffon. Is so soft and deli
cate that it gives effects that nothing
else can. When mingled with pearl
and all manner of silken flossy threads,
it can be imagined how very beautiful
the whole is. This dress has a train,
and the whole of this Is wrought with
more of the chiffon in the form of flow
ers and studded with pearls and held
in place with other flowers of floss.
The effect of the close worked lIlies
made of chiffon on the thin and filmy
silk muslin is simply exquisite. This
dress Is made in something of an em
pire style, and the same ornamentation
is somewhat like that on the skirt.
But It is the cloak, coat or wrapf
whichever it is called, on which I wish
to lay stress, for nothing like it has
been seen here before. The shape is
empire and has short fronts and hangs
from the back high up on the shoul
ders. It is open in front and has a
train almost as long as the dress. The
body of the garment Is of velvet eisele,
and the figures are raised in high relief
and are surrounded with gold enz
broldery in the finest possible threadz'
and it is fairly stiff with the mr'erial
and its added embroidery. The sleeves
have the upper parts solidly wrought
with the most superb of work in addi
tion to the original richness of the vel
vet. Around the bottom of the sleeves
are bands of Russian crown sable and
ruffles of chiffon. The collar, which is
to be worn up or down as suits, is also
of sable. The whole garment is lined
with 'sthe heaviest and richest brocade.
and the edges are bordered with sable
fur, which we all know is worth its
weight in gold. At the sides this is
made double depth, and around the up
per edge is a row of gold balls. Along
the front there is a full ruching of
white chiffon quite deep. It is a dar
ing thing to do to put white chiffon
and such costly fur together, but when
it is done we are obliged to admit it Is
well done.
I suppose I ought to mention the hat
worn with this wrap, so say that it was
an enormous picture bat of black vel
vet, with drapery of Irish lace and
with three great white flowers some
thing like white poppies. anl they
were made of chiffon. Some black
plumes curled around the crown, and
the flowers rested on the hair. Now
all of you know ay I can tell Qout
the wonderful coat that has set half
New York crazy, and I will say a few
words about a waist worn by this real
ly tasteful woman. It is not every
one who has fine clothes who has the
most taste. This is a white baby waist
of white mull shirred closely at the
belt and at the neck. It is IYPiTadour
shape and has a bertha of fine point
across the front, and over this is a
figaro of point do vnise worth a farm.
This has a flat collar and revers of the
same and sleeves also. All al n:; the
edge of this is a row of loops mande of
white silk feath'rl.one cable cord,
which gives it a superb finish. Not one
point of color goes with the e hole suit.
The hat is of black shirred tuile, with
a long black ostrich plume ant a largq
square gold buckle. These are but feig
of the beautiful things worn by the
mous young actress.
