NEED MORE HOMES.

We" Made to Get Other Go.versmaet
Lands Opened to Neuters.
Lawton, I. T., Aug. 9.--A movement
I has been started here by the homesoek
ezn who lost to have the government
open up the land which was set aside in
the Lawton district before the opening.
At a meeting of 100 or more of them it
was decided to petition the interior do
1 partment at once to take such action.
This land embraces, M2,500 asses or
about 8.80 quarter sections. The land
was held in reserve, it is believed, be
cause the government anticipated the
cattlemen who had all of the Kiowa.
Commanohe country leased for pastures
would not be able to find pastures in
Texas or other cattle grazing sections
readily. If the cattlemen can round up
their cattle and get them to the govern
ment reservations this fall, the home
seekers argue they can find pastures
some where else by next spring. The
homueseekers are willing to buy the land
outright from the government.
