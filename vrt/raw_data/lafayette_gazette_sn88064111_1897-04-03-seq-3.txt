Ernest and Alexis Blanc, the murderers of
poor Martin Begnand, were hanged yester
day between the hours of 2 and 3 in the
afternoon. People began to arrive in town
Thursday, when an unusually large number
of strange faces were noticed on the streets
of Lafayette. Since the early hours of
Friday it was clearly apparent that the
crowd attracted by the hanging would be
the largest ever seen in the town. The
wall which had been erected around the
Scaffold to comply with the law was of such
h height that those who were not contented
with looking at the unfortunate young
Frenchmen before the fatal drop, climtbed
trees and roofs of hcuscs in order to be able
to witness the end-of the awful drama which
vas, about to be concluded.
It is estimated that there were fully 4,000
people present. Every town from New Or
leans to the Texas line was represented. So
many were hanging in the trees on the
court-house square that Alexis facetionsly
remarked that "those trees were full of
fruits." Most of the people impatiently
waited for the hour of the execution wihile
others applied to the sheriff to let them
'isit the Ilanc:;. but as that officer had his
hands full with more serious duties he
could not always attend to the
Aisitors. With few exceptions the immense
throng behaved well, occasionally sonie who
had probably imbibed too freely of alcohol,
made themselves disagreeablt. At about
i2 o'clock Sheriff BIroussard went to his
office where he deputized the following cit
izenS to assist him at Ihe cxecution. 1). A.
Cochrane, Aurelien Olivier, J. O. Blroussard,
Alex D. Verrot, IIamp lMenton, Aurelien
Patin, Israel Prejean, Rodolph Roy, Geo.
Melchoir, J. W. Broussard. The following
gentlemen who were present toiok their
oaths as witnesses: I). Doucet, J. T. Miul
kern, Simeon Begnaud, Jean Becgnaud, Leo
Judice, Jean A. Begnaud. The sheriff re
quested the witnesses to be at the jail at
half past one o'clock, while the presence of
the deputies was required th .re an hour
earlier.
The night of April Ist was the last time
Ernest and Alexis Blanc enjoyed the resto
rative influences of balmy sleep. They
were very cheerful; as much so as it was
possible for two human beings to be, with
tuch a dreadful fate staring them in the
Sface. They recognized and cordially
greeted all comers; even some persons they
AScarcely knew, they remembered and ad
dressed politely. Shlowing that their men
tal faculties were in perfect order, their
pulse beat noritally, and there was not a
quiver of the muscles. Nothing indicated
ihat their animal instincts shrank from the
ordeal they were shortly to undergo, while
the moral part of their beings was not pro
foundly affected as they indulged in some of
the ghastliest jokes that ever fell from hu
man lips. For instance when questioned
abotit their early training and the studies
they preferred at school, Alexis expressed a
preference for history and geography, which
was in unison with what he said on a for
mer occasion that his boyish ambition had
beeft to be a marine and that the works of
fiction which he remembered with peculiar
kusto were those of Gustave Ayntar which
dealt with adventures among the Indian
4ribes of North America, while Ernest said
that he had no particular penchant for any
atudy  ht rchool unless it was that of (with a
laugh) gymnastics, but that he would
hortly htiv- an. opportumity to practice
_aftu stlc~ in a sort of trapeze performance,
a aericocomedy in which he and Alexis ex
pected to be the chief actors with a howling
tabble as mu audientice. They kept up a
tssnning. fire of badinage.
" Ern:estm dtre: a picture, fot a muscle of the
t get' twitching, representing a highway
* ith a cocked-pistol and dirk, holding
up a poor chtap who was on his knees before
them; This picture they showed to Mr.
Simeon Ilegnaud, but upon this gentleman
turning away with apparent disgust, they
both assured him there was no intention of
reproducing anything like a picture of their
crime, and on Mr. Begnaud's advice they
tore it up. They answered all questions
quickly and intelligently.
When urged to lie down so as to get as
much rest as possible to prepare for the or
deal they had to go through the next day,
they insisted on sitting up and chatting until
after I o'clock in the morning. Even after
retiring they spoke and joked with each
other until exhausted, when nature threw
around them the mantle of charitable ob
livion.
They told the sheriff t.i arouse them at 5
a. m. which he did, but they begged to be
allowed to sleep a little longer and they
dozed off until 5:30o. They did not break
bread until they received holy communion
at 8 o'ciock' Then visitors began to arrive
and the scenes of the day before com
menced. They were perhaps a trifle less
full of levity, but they still indulged ill
humorous sallies. Their color became a
little heightened towards noon, but they yet
displayed that marvelous composure they
manifested from the time of their arrest.
At one o'clock Father Knapp, a Domini
can friar, who is holding a mission here,
came in to render the last sad rites of con
solation of mother church. The father,
who is exceedingly handsome, made the
scene the more impressive. His stalwart
figure, clothed in cossack, his classic face
beaming with kindness and humanity, will
long be rememb,-red. The silent moving of
the lips as if impelled by inward prayer,
asking, doubtless, the Great Jehovah to par
don the youthful criminals and temper the
morbid crowd was noticeable.
SWhen Father Knapp arrived the prisoners
were about to take a bath, which they did
with.,crupulous care, washing their feet and
bodies in a tub. They put on neat garments
which Sheriff Broussard had provided for
them, and when dressed they were a very
handsome pair of young men. leciig
offered collars they refused to put them on,
Alexis saying that lie did not want to place
any obstruction in the way of the rope. A
short while after Father Knapp entered the
cell and remained with them.
At 1:45 Sheriff Broussard read the death
warrant. IThey listened to that document
with perfect composure. Under the tutelane
of Father K napp their faces lost some of
their levity, although Ernest frequently
smiled while talking, and Alexis' cesf
maintained tileir glitter and his voice its
uual vivacity, the only evidence of any
unusual strain was an occasional gulping on
the part of Alexis as though a lump formed
in his throat, while Ernest was observed to
moisten his lips with his tongue.
At 2:04 the march to the gallows began,
in the following order. ist, the holy man

The two brothers walked up the stairs
with a firm tread. When they reached the
r summit of the scaffold they knelt when they
were blesse l by Father Knapp who recited
the act of contrition with them.
Ernest then in a clear, well modulated
r voice, addressed the crowd in chaste French
the substance of which was the caution to
i young men to avoid evil books which might
have a tendency to start them on the down
e gradeofa criminal carecr, asj it had done for
them. He counseled them to follow strictly
f the tenets of religion and the advice of their
parents.
As soon as Ernest concluded his remarks,
Sheriff Broussard adjusted the fatal noose
around Ernest's neck and then he placed it
around Alexia'; he quickly covered the
- bIrothers' faces with the black caps, tied
I their legs. and before many were aware of
f it, the engine of death was set in motion
r and two lifeless bodies were launched in
Sspace.
The drop fell at 2:10 and at 2:14 all
1 muscular tremor had ceased, both necks
Sbeing dislocated by the fall. They un
5 questionably lost all sensation the moment
I the drop was sprung. The slight bodily
C movement of the bodies for four minutes
after being mechanical. The last mech
- anical spasmodic movement of Alexis was a
:stiffening of the right arm.
At 2:a3, 13 minultes after the
drop fell Coroner A. R. Trahan,
a Drs. Webb and Mouton, prg-
nounced Ernest and Alexis Blanc
: dead and the bodies were lowered,
placed in coffins and carried to the
court-'house where, upon examina
tion by Dr. Trahan and his assis
tants, it was ascertained that their
necks had been dislocated.
With the exception of the detach
ing of a plank, which the Sheriff
immediately replaced, there was
nothing to mar the harmony of the
dismal scene.
Thousands were admitted to view
the bodies as they lay in front of
the court-house in their white
covered pine coffins. The discolo
ration of their faces had commenced
to pale and to assume the waxen
hues of death.
During the afternoon the bodies
were taken to the Catholic church
and were given decent burial.
Too much credit cannot be ac
corded Sheriff Broussard, who, in
i the conduct of this case from the
inception to the end, carried out
every detail so successfully. His
dealings with the large crowd
k were characterized by firmness and
good-humor. The law prohibited
Deputy Sheriff Mouton.
a public hanging and he performed
the execution in private, as far as
it was humanly possible to do so. The
wall surrounding the scaffold was
x4 feet high, the upper halves of
the bodies of the criminals being
visible A great load has been
lifted off the sheriff's shoulders.
The following is a literal trans
lation of a portion of the mani
script given by the l3lancs to Mr.
Thomas Mouton. It was written
by Alexis and signed by both. It
is a full history of the crime acnd a
sketch of the murderers:
SUNDAY, Feb. 28, 1897.
At this mom-nt I am incarcerated
in the jail at Lafayette. Through
the bars of my cell I am able to see
only a small spot of the green
earth. The weather is beautiful;
the sun lights the town with its
golden rays, none of which shine
on me, confined in my dismal cell.
But why are we here, without hope
and with the scaffold as the only
alternative? It is because we have
committed a crime, the penalty of
which we must pay with our lives.
A few years ago, it .vas in Paris,
France, that our beloved mother
breathed her last after a long and
painful illness. Poor mother !
I-low she must have suffered, if
from her heavenly abode she looked
down upon us and followed us
- through our lives. We were left
alone on earth, two unhappy or
phants with no parents to guide us.
\Ve were then, one x6 and the
other 15, years old. By the sale of
a few household articles we realized
a little money. Considering our
position ,ye decided to leave France
as we had no reason to remain
there. Ve journeyed through Bel
t gium, visiting Brussels, Bourges
and Anvers, and finally boarded a
steamer bound for New York where
r we landed on the 24th of August,
1893.
r Immediately after our arrival
there, the love for adventure took
possession of us and having enough
money we departed for St. Louis,
t passing through Norfolk, Cincin
nati, Indianapolis and Louisvil!e,
arriving at St. Louis, where we
Esoon spent all our money. Being
apenniless, we entered upon a life
Sof privation and misery. For two
months we had little to eat and
1 sometimes nothing at all. After
Sseveral efforts to secure employ
- ment, a farmer near St. Louis gave
t us work and a home; we remained
r there all winter. \Vith the ap
proach of spring, our adventurous
- spirit again took possession of us,
Sand not having been paid in money
we did not care to remain where we
were. Then we pacRed our be
longings and left for New Orleans,
and a month later reached that
: city, having suffered much from
,cold and hunger. But in that
French city, we r-cesved not
much more hospitality than in
the American cities, and we
crossed the river and continued
our journey having nothing in view
but the procurement of employment.
[ It is in this way we arrived at the
!home of old Col. Boudreaux and
for two years we worked on his
plantation following the pursuits of
farming. It was a life of tranquil
F ity, sweet and honest, which we re
gret having discarded to follow the
evil promptings of ambition; .the
I love of fortune, and the desire'[ar
gold whiLh the devil suggestedy
us through the leaves of a book ei
titled the "James Boys." It was
k by reading this book we were lead
tt, steal. Why work in the field ?
SWhy walk behind a plow ? And at
t the end of the year receive not
enough to buy clothes to put on our
backs ?
To rob one of his gold in a single
I night appeared to us much easier.
1 The birds had eaten the crops and
I we were discouraged. Then to put
- our new plan into execution we
bought two revolvers and made two
poignards of files. After being well
armed we decided to rob Martin
Begnaud and eight days afterwards
we were on our way determined to
execute our project. For two days
we hesitated, but the third, (the day
following the election) April 22,
1896, we fully succeeded. That
night we arrived at Scott at 9
o'clock. All was calm and quiet.
Nearly everybody in the town were
asleep, with the exception of those
in Simeon Begnaud's saloon. It
was yet too early to begin our work
and we sought refuge in the tall
grass along the railroad, watching
the movements of all those who
were in the saloon. Shortly after
the doors of the saloon were shut
and everyone went home. We saw
Martin Begnaud going toward his
store. The time to act had come.
It was then or never. We walked
hurriedly to the store, but we ar
rived too late, the door having al
ready been closed. W\e knocked
at the door. Martin Begnaud came
and asked, *"who is there ?" '-It is
Ernest Blanc.
us," we responded; then entering
the store we bought a pack of to
bacco, stating that as we worked
all clay we could not come earlier.
\Ve conversed upon different sub
jects before ais opportunity pre
sented itself for an advantageous at
tack, he being behind the counter.
We were about to leave when the
idea came to our mind to ask him
to show us some rat traps, for
t which he had to come from behind
the counter, and now the op
portunity .for which we had
long awaited came. Hie showed
f us the traps, and after explaining
I how to use them he leaned against
r the counter. His back was turned
to us and when he turned around he
found himself facing the revolver
_ and dagger of Alexis. He was so
a surprised that he leaped towards us
i1 n a vain effort to disarm us. "Do
not m.'ve. If you do you are
dead," Ernest replied pointing his
pistol closer to his head. Paralized
I by the fear of being shot or pierced
, with a dagger, he remained quiet.
It was then that Alexis shut the
door which was opened. We then
told him: '-Now, Martin, all that
we want is that you open your safe
in order that those crisp bills may
pass from your s'fe into our
pockets." Without saying a word
he walked to that small piece of
iron furniture, whose contents have
r excited more than one human
Smind. Five minutes later the safe
Swas opened and it was with some
1difficulty as he trembled very much
Sbefore he found the combination.
It was then, without futhier to do
about the money, we began to tie
Shis hands and to entwine his body
: with calico to make him more se
cure, and after conducting him to
Shis room we tied his feet and made
t him sit on his bed. I remained
Snear the bed, the pistol in my hand
t watching every movement of the un
fortunate prisone:, while Alexis
ransacked the safe with as much
sangfroid as a banker does his own.
Despite the gag Martin could speak
distinctly and it was at this
moment that he said: ',Why do
you treat me in this manner? Had
you asked me to give you some
money I would have done so."
But I replied, "You are saying this
because you are canght." Alexis
then said he had to tell him where
were the keys of those two little
drawers. Martin replied: The keys
are in one of the opened drawers,
and furthermore, one of drawers
contains only private papers while
the other contains some gold."
Alexis returned to the safe and
found but one key which opened
the drawer containing the gold; he
searched for the other iKey, but
could not find it, but being satisfied
with the money he had found, he
believed Martin's word that the
other drawer contained only pa
pers. After waiting impatiently near
the bed about fifteen minutes I
walked over to where my brother
was to see if he had finished rifling
the safe. I noticed on the floor
near the safe two sacks tilled with
money while Alexis' pockets were
puffed with bank notes. iVe were
discussing the manner in which we
would tie him so that he could not
give the alarm before morning, when
he said:
"Do not destroy my account
books nor my private papers, with
out which I cannot make a living."
In the silence of the night this
sonoyrois voice appeared probably
stronger than it really was and im
pressed us with a feeling impossible
to express, and we rushed to his
room and I (Ernest) stabbed Mar
tin who was sitting on his bed.
How mtiany tiries I stabbed him I
know not, nor did I ever know.
All that I remember is that Martin
uttered a smothered groan after the
first plunge of the dagger, which
was certainly mortal. Without
losing any time we walked out of
the house and fled along the rail
road track to our cabin. After ar
riviiig, the first thing we did was to
bury the money, and conceal our
bank-notes and weapons, and we
burned all clews. The next morn
ing when we heard of the crime we
were with Col. Boudreaux in his
orchard picking Japan plums. The
old colonel was stupefied. We
feigned to be equally affected. A
short while after we were Informed
that the sheriff would arrive on the
scene with bl-od-hounds to track
the murderers. We had not
thought of blood-hounds befcre and
this information caused us some un
easiness, and the consequence was
we remained in our cabin all day.
At four o'clock in the afternoon the
dogs, after trailing around the store,
seemed to take a trail along the
railroad which they followed to the
place where we left the track the
night before. WVe were very inuch
relieved when we felt sure that the
dogs had lost the scent. After
staying one week without being sus
pected and making believe that we
had received some money we left on
the I2:4o train for New Orleans
with the stolen money strapped
around us. Immediately upon our
arrival in New Orleans we bought
I ,alises and going to a hotel soon re
lieved ourselves ot our belts. The
next morning we left for Atlanta,
thence to New York where we
rested several days before taking
our departure for Europe. After
six days of traveling we arrived at
Southampton, England, and the
next day we were at Havre, France.
We purchased new cl,-thes and
lived several days there indulging in
the best of wines and the finest of
French cooking. Dressed as
S1 !
Alexis Blanc.
Princes, aind loaded with go!l, we
nmade our triumphal entrance into
SParis, where we livedl :is million
:aires, rode fine horses, viiitinlz all
I the theatres, and continuing to in
I dulge in good wines and associating
- with pretty women. -o'rr tired of
this life of dissipation we again de
sired to travel. After visiting
Belgium and England we boarded
a steamer for New YorKc City ar
riving there on the t2th of July.
We had already spent the greater
portion of the $3,ooo. Then we
commenced our journey across the
United States, visiting Chicago, St.
Paul, 1-Telena, Portland, Sacre
mento, San Francisco, Los Angelos;
El Paso, Salt Lake City, Ogden.
Omaha, Council Bluffs and St.
Louis. In the latt r city we
spent the remainder of our money.
Each one. having ten dollars, wd
took the Iriscd line on foot, pass
ing through Missodri, Arkans;ti,
Indian Territory and Texas, and
followed the Texas Pacific as far
as Mexico, where we rested a few
days. All along the route we tried
to get work, but-failed. There wad
nothing for strangers to do. It id
in this manner that we reached
Lafayette on Jal.uary 2, 1897.
Knowing so many people there we
thought it would be easy to find
employment. \Ve knew that we
were risking our necks, but being
so miserable, did not care very
tnuch.
The day after our arrival at Col.
Doudreaux's we received a visit
from the sheriff whd arrested us and
conducted us to prison, and being
interrogated by Sheriff Broussard
and others, we confessed our crime,
and the same day we were conveyed
to New Orleans for fear of mob
law.
WVe remained in the city a month
and a half and on the Ioth of Feb
ruary, 1897, we were brought to
Lafayette for trial. The trial was
fixed for the 17ti of February but
postponed to the 25th. The trial
lasted two days and half a night
and we were condemned to hang
after eloquent pleadings of our
attorne)s.
We are n:.w awaiting the day of
our execution, thinking that it is
hard to (die so young, but God's
will be done.
