In his last story Mark Twain tells
F¬; of a young colored girl who "ex
':. -perienced religion" in a revival.
The next day, in dusting her
i i aster's desk, she happened upon a
:two-dollar bill which had been left
Sthere by accident: "Lord-a-mas- i
r-: sy,"she said, as she covered it with 1
-a book, so as not to be further
S empted, "how I wish't that revival
' a.-d been put off till tomorrow." The
Conversion was not thorough, and t
ought have had another day or two
to finish the job.

; Carencro correspondent pays his t
respects to the "A. P. A" this week. t
This _association which is quite t
i-- tr6ng in some parts of the country,
is composed of men sworn to ostra- t
cise Catholic citizens from employ- c
inent of any kind either public or c
private. This discrimination i
against a class of citizens on ac- f
cbunt of their religious belief is so a
itrociously unjust that no person F
.with a spark of American manhood I
will belong to it. Catholics act
wisely in treating these fanatics t
with "silent contempt." d
Mr. Elisha Attaway, late of the b
parish of Avoyells, has invented ao
machine for sacking grain, cotton
seed, etc. An examination of his
invention has been made in the pat
- nt office, resulting in a decision in
favor of its merits. It is said to be
a great improvement over the old
way of sacking cotton seed for which l
it was intended, but it is to be hoped li
that the people of the grain States
*:ill be equally interested and bene
fited.-Mannsfield Democrat-Jour
Siid.
If we may judge the present muni- la
tipal ring in New Orleans from
what the press says of it the Crescent
SCity is goveined by a pretty tough (l
set. The States arraings the losses<
in the following strong language: tl
"The present city ring is the most to
"brazen and the most infamous that
has ever fastened itself on the zom
munity. It has openly dragged its ti'
Eorruption under the noses of the its
':peple; laughed in scorn at public fhi
sntiment ahd to-day revels in its d
mv. Such a ring of political pe
e iesradoes can not be driven from th
oer by speeches of a more or less
ery character. Work and work
serious nattire will be required lii
d 9t lhat the citizens of New ra
imotst sooner or later address Ti
i e condition of the Democratic th
at the itesent time is appalling yr
the least. From all sections tii
Enion come the reports that sel
le are disgusted with the th
of the party to tevise the th
N&lr eem its pledge. The co
mbcratic leaders who have pr
been clamoring for a revi- the
-tariff are to-day engaged hii
the passage of the frc
.thiat ptomises to bring Af
reform. The Wilson cal
*. changed that it is an
iither would fail to foa
·Uoies -the Npai ty tie
e'T tactics and to
hck the con- di
i#9'
. In-vew of the factthat -the chair
man of- the "parish -Democratic ex
g. ecutive committee has issued a -call
-nor a meeting of that body o% the
-3st instant it may hot be out of or
der to offer our suggestions as to
the best mode of selecting a stan
dard bearer to repiesent the Demo
e. cratic party.
the The Gazette believes strictly in
party organization, and would like
to see the candidate of the party
lye selected inside the party organiza
tion. And the only way to do so
Lde with perfect fairness, in our mind,
be to all concerned and at the same time
vill keeping the lines unbroken, is by a
primary election.
A mass meeting does not repre
en sent always the sense of the majority.
sh Because (x) we have often seen how
bea few bold men, with strongly de
-he voted henchmen, have ovetcome
y lpable majorities; and (2) a mass
he meeting will prove a great incon
ib- venience to many voters living at
Ord great distances; it would be difficult
he to get together a majority of the
at Democratic voters of the parish.
But, by primaries, the polls es
tablished at control and most con
, venient points, a voter could have
uk no reasonable excuse rlot to take
he part, save that of indifference, for
ks it could entail but little trouble, and
one which no party man would not
willingly take for the sake of the
ad interests of the party.
of Then, since this appears the plan
rt, best calculated to suit the conve
ce nience of the voters, and can be
fair to all parties concerned, it 4
lIs occurs to The Gazette that the exe
x- cutive committee can adopt this
al. plan without much fear of it not
Cr meeting general approval.
a With the Gazette, as we have just
:ft said, the keeping of the party organ
is- ization intact is of the first impor
th tance, favorites come next.

al enry Watterson Lectures The
Presi Lnllt.
he Henry Watterson says in his paper
the Louisville Courier-Journal:
no No party ever came into power
with so great an opportunity, and
's no one ever put a great opportunity
is to such base uses or cut so poor a
k. figure. All is choas, and for the
te time being all seems lost. Mr.
y, Cleveland could yet retrieve the for
a- tunes of the day if he could get rid
y- of the terror into which his message
or of 1887 threw him, when he realized I
>n its meaning, and would cut aloof °
c- from the moneyed influences Which b
to appear to have gotten as complete
in possession of him as they had of
>d poor General Grant.
ct It is not too late for Mh Cleveland
: to recover his lost popularity and to
do his country incalculable service
by the enlightened display of some
of thitt backbone for which he has
a received so much credit. Instead
of frittering his strength away by an
unseemly wrangle with the New
York senators over pickle-herring '`
issues of New York origin, revolting
-e n
to the good sense of the people at j;
large, he were better engaged in the 2
d work of uniting the party upon the S.
line of the national platform. The !
latter half of the silver promise yet :
remains to be fulfilled. The promise i
as to the repeal of the tax on state et
banks still stands where Mr. Cleve
land's own friends placed it.
It is yet possible to call a halt
upon the antics of the protectionist Al
doughfaces who masquerade as dem
ocrats in the senate and to force Iy
them to come back to the party or
to get out and take the consequences. pr
The indications, if our informa- N<
Stion is correct, though from a cred
Sitor, is that there is very little hope
fhat Prof. Knapp, will settle his in
sdebtedliess to the people of the uip
per part of the parish. It appears l
that the Teche Railroad or MIr.
Knapp owe these people something
like $70o,ooo000. for work on said
railroad or on the Huron plantation.
They had so much confidence in
the sweet promises of Mr. Knapp
that they let the railroad take their
crops for Mr. Knapp without posi
tively knowing to whom they were
selling. We are further informed
that Mr. Knapp told those people
that he was simply agent for the
concern, that the proprietors had
promised him the money to pay for ?
the cane, but as they did not pay
him, he could not pay the planters
from whom he had got the cane.
After Mr. Knapp had left, some so
called capitalists had come there
and said they would be responsible
for the future debts of the planta
tion and .tailroad. All this seems
to be tinted with suspicion. What
did Mr. Knapp do with the sugar _nd
he made from the cane of thd poor -
~ters? Why don't he give a
--i.rlan&,1 i on of the dispalositidn
pa, It is to bei hoped that these
r- p ple will be more cautious in the
future and will not put their confi
11 dence-in strangers. -Let them de
1e liver their crop .only on the pay
ment of the hard c-sh, when deal
ing with .suspicious persons.-St
Martinville Messenger.
Dudley Dubose of Montana and
a nephew of Robert Tombs, is said

o trict at the age of 23.
