How to Bake an Apple Pie.-Pie is
generally denounced, and with justice.
Tmie crust is either too rich or toungi
and heiav1, unfit for digestion, and
unlplatable. Yet there iare those whl,

and healthy-that lies light on the,

Bake slowly and get well done.
Watering Plants.-Theo theory of
watering plants Is this: The roots
are to be wetted without leaving any
standing water ; this, well done, will
answer thle purpose for several days
where the plants tlre in the ground.
It should he done on cloudy days or
ait evening. The mere sprinkling of
water on the surface does no good ;
the water does not get down 'deep
enongh, and besides, in a hot sun,
the evaporation cools the. ground so
as to threaten, if not injure the more
sensitive plants. What is best, is to
mulch plants with the short grass cut
from the lawn, or dry dust fromn the
street will answer ; give so much wa
ter and such protection that there
shall be no quick evaporation. So
far, this yeotr, web have had no severe
drought for plants having deep roots,
but, in this and next month, we may
expect diy weather. It is below, and
not on the sunrfte, that water is need
ed and benelicial.--Provideuce Jour

News makes the dish as follows: A
half gallon of washed rice is.put into
a large, cainp kettle, and with afu8i
cient watker set to boiling. Abfr a
while sfiies of fat pickled pork are
put in; at intervals, half-fried pieces
of bear mneat,- venison and hban are
dropped in and well stirred; then a
loggerhead turtle, and by and-by
three owls, two 'wild ducks, a half
dozen squirrels, andtfive or six small
cat fish with broken biscuit, are put
in, with an abundance of garlic on
ions, red and black pepper, salt and
leaves of sweet bay, for a high sea
eoning; the whole thoroughly cooked
and eaten cold.
Beds.-To renovate old feather
beds, when no steam apparatus is
convenient, put them out doors du
ring a heavy rain. Let them dry in
tlhe sun, beating theam occasionally
with sticks to loosen the feathers.
They should be turned over several
times, and then thoroughly dried. .A
paste of soap arid starch will take
stains out of bedl-ticking. Spread it,
over the spots. When dry, scrape oil
and wash with a damp sponge.
To Pickle Eggs.-Boil the eggs
hard, remove 'the iihellt, 'and cover
the eggs with vinegar in which blood
beets have been pickled, For a pic
nic these are very nice and showy.
