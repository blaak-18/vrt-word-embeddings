NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS.
All defendants in judicial sales
have the right to elect the paper
in which the advertisement is to he
inserted, therefore we would ask
our friends to give us a hid before
advertising. The Populist is be
ing run in the interest of humani
ty, and it is the duty of all men to
'support it. Also those who enter
homesteads have a right to select
their own paper for advertising.
Don't fail to give us a call and we
will treat you well.
Our Judiciary.
Next week we will give an edito
rial from one of our ablest and old
est Populist papers, the Noncon
formist, on "Tenure for Life" of
our federal jndges. The article at
tacks the wisdom of giving federal
judges a lile tenure in office as a
preventative of partisanism and
corruption in office, and argues for
their election by a direct vote of
the people.
The partisan rulings against la
bor and in favor of capital by
Bicks, Jenkins and Pullmau's aven
ger against Debs are cited to illus
trate the evils of our present fede
ral court system, and Marshall
the ablest of our Chief Justices is
quoted as saying, "A corrupt ju
diolary is the worst curse that can
be sent by a vengetful deity upon
a sinful people."
The article is well-timed, and
we hope the "Non-Con" will go
firther in a fnture article, antl
point out the evils of a partisan
eleotite judiciary and the remedy
therefor.
We have numerous instances of
the bitterly partisan actionofele.ted
judges in the interest of that politi
cal party which exalted them to
their positions. One of the strong
eat examples is quoted in the ar
tidele referred to; speaking of the
elekctoral commiselon of '76, which
eiated Hayes, it anys, "The peo
plethen saw the grave and ir
maculalte judges, in the decision of
questions purely legal, diviiag
strietlg on party i,e with as much
facility and promptness as ordina
ry beelers obeying a cauces de
cree. It was found that even
judge. for life were still men, and
nothing loath to 'give up to party'
what was meant for mankind."
We ask in all candor, would not
this deldorable condition have
beae lateasiled by the election of
themse partisuas by their respective
political parties? Evidently it is
partissalm as well as the appoint
ive saystaem that must be removed
from oar cnar. It Is batr-atural

when hlectedl ,uch men would imn
partially serve the masses of the I
people regardless of party cliques eI
and mabhiies. Owing his success 0
to no party and having no hope of ii
future advancement for party ser- (l
vice, a judge elected in such a way
would meet out equal and exact
:lstic"e to all. and expect his re- t
ward in the answer of a clear con
science and the blessings of a hap
pyv people. This would not neces
sarily deprive a candidate for a
judicial position of the right of
suffrage, voting the ticket of his
choice, but would relieve him of
party or machine service or obliga:
tion.
It remained for the People's
party to inaugurate this plan of
improving our judicial system and
while it has not been the universal
custom in that party, it has been
the precedent established by it in
this and many other states, and we
hope the plan will soon become a
general one not only with that par
ty but with both the old parties.
The plan seems to have been an
eminenly wise one with the Polpu
lists for reasons that may have
been potent in forcing them to
adopt it. Lawyers, who in most
cases are required to fill these po
sitions, are trained by their pro
fession to take as a rule "cither
side of a case" that presents itself
to them, provided the emoluments
are sufficient. Therefore you find
the lawyers "as a rule" in that
party which is strong enough to
elect, or control the appointment of
the officers, and as the new party
has not reached that period of its
growth in many places as yet, we
find but few lawyers in it, hence
few eligible to these positions.
But if this non-partisan idea
should prevail, as we believe it will
sooner or later, and lawyers should
discover that being democrats or
republicans did not mean the office
every time, we should find a great
many more of them in the People's
party, or at least giving express
ion to their honest sentiments re
gardless of party.
There are several judicial dis
tricts in this state which the Pop
ulists can control, and instead of
nominating some weak lawyer who
has half-way come over to them
for that very purpose, we hope to
see them denouncing all nominees
for such offices, voting for the best
men only, men who are indepen
dent of all parties, and lending
their energies to elect Populist
legislators and their other tickets
in full.
ACT AT ONCE.
The appeal headed, "The Peo
ple's Fight," which. appears in an
other column, is one" that will
reach the heart as well as the pock
et-book of every Populist in the
4th Congressional District that
wears either of these articles about
iais person.
There are but two answers to be
made to this appeal: one is the
answer of the indolent or the slug
gard who says "I cant," and gives
up the fight to submit to privation
ten times worse than those denials
necessary to do their part in the
cause of reform ; the other answer
is that of action, which speaks
louder than words. Every ener
getic hustler who despises oppres
sion and is a freeman by choice
and not by gift, will meet this hon
est, earnest appeal with action
either in work or money-be it ever
so little~
Bemember that while times are
hard and money searee, our party,
which is the only hopelm of relief un
der the sun, is steadily forging to
the front-never making a back
ward step-galningTn every election,
and just as sure to win as the old
parties contnnue their service of
Wall street. Bat the people can
very materially hasten tbe victory
if they will puah the fight. Or
they can seriously retard it by
sluggishneu aid Inaction.
The faulds that we wish to show
up by this contest ar daue largely

Several whole-souled brave-hearted s
Populists in each parish did their i,
duty, and more than was expected v
of them, but the majority did noth- '
ing hut vote, and numbers (lid not it
do even that. 11
We know men who staid at hone
election day on the silly excuse
that it was of no use to vote, they
would be counted out. Such cow
ardly inaction makes it possible
for us to be counted out. Such
men (so-called) do not deserve to t
be free, and ought to be perfectly a
satistied t with the present delight- t
ful(!) state of affairs, or any other
condition their masters see fit to
give them ; but it has always been (
~o, the sluggards and do nothings t
never get interested until the tight
is won, i hen they do the crowing,
while a few brave-hearted perse- 1
vering souls do the work, bear the
burdens, make the sacrifices, aund
get-a big name after they are
dead.
The workers never stop, howev
er, to parley over what they are to
receive, but bent on duty they
press fearlessly to the front, and
1o what their hands find to do.
We have many such workers in
the Fourth District, and we hope
they will take up this part of their
work and push it to a successful
issue.
What is done will have to be
done quickly, as we have only
about 90 days now in which to
complete our case and let every
one do his duty. Intormation as
to evidence that may be secured,
and contributions may be forward
ed to this office, which will be
headquarters in the contest.
PROHIBITION QUESTION.
Must Not be a Sidetrack.
The petition on this question,
referred to elsewhere as a news
item, having secured the necessary
number of names, will go before
the police jury next Monday, and
in all probability will be acted up
on favorably, that is an election
will doubtless be ordered.
Now in principle, we are and
have always been a prohibitionist,
not in the sense of belonging to a
political party which is in existence
in the United States, and is sup
posed to have that idea as its basic
principle, but locally, and for the
benefit of those people, a majority
of whor ,desire to be free from
the whiskey influence.
And we are agreeably surprised
at evidences which lead us to be
liove that a majority of the people
of Natchitoches parish. will at this
time favor prohibition.
But we have never considered
prohibition a question of national
importance, nor worthy of super
ceding any of the great questions
agitating the people of this State
to-day, many of which will come
up for solution at the ballot-box
about a year hence. The most im
portant question that is before the
public to-day, and which the peo
of Natchitoches must help to solve,
is a question that amounti now
practically to prohibition, not on
ly of the sale of whiskey, but of
the sale of every thingelse as well;
and preferring no prohibition at
all to this particular brand, we
would strenuously oppose the cam
paign about to be inaugurated, if it
should be delayed or extended so
far into the future, as to form any
part of the approaching State
campaign.
While we believe every man,
whom we know to be heading this
movement, is actuated by honest
motives and is favoring prohibi
tion either on moral or business
principles, there are those who be
lieve that the movement will be an
attempt to "side track," so far as
this parish is concerned-and may
hap the state-the issues of reform
that must be made in our state
campaign. We do not incline to
this latter view and hope it is not
well founded, but the time that is
given for the prohibition campaign
as masured by the date on which
the election is fixed, will determine
whether or not sinister motives or
political trickery is behind the
movement

ADDRESS ISSUEDBY THE ST.
LOUIS CONFERENCE.
Held Dec. 28 and 29. 1894.
The national committee of the
People's party sends greeting to
its constituency throughout the
United States.
The rapid increase ,of our vote
in every part of the union and the
startling events of the past few
years vividly justify both the exis
tence of and necessity for the Peo
ple's party. The contention of
the party that one of the great
needs of this country has been, and
is, an enlarged volume of circula
ting medium, is now practically
conceded by all parties and by the
government. The gold powers
and banking interests are insisting,
through the president and his sec
retary, that the enlarged issue of
money supply shall be given ex
clusively into the hands of the
banks; that silver shall be exclud
ed, all treasury notes retired, and
that gold alone shall be a legal
tender, thus making the monetary
question an issue which must be
met at once.
Within the present year the cor
porations, grown arrogant because
of the vast possessions of wealth
and the exercise of unconstitutional
powers, have made war upon the
people and induced the federal
courts to exercise in their interest
unusual and arbitrary powers, in
duced the invasion of the states by
federal troops without the re
quest of either the executives of
said states or .the legislatures
thereof, and are at this time,
through a recreant administration
mad a truculent congres, attempt
ing to clothe the railroad corpora
tions, by meais of a pooling bill,
with power to further and more
systematically rob, oppress and
plunder the people, and having al
ready deprived the people of ac
cesato the shilver mines of the
country as an independent souse
>f money supply. are now in the p
nterest of a banking oligarchy, en- rt
leavoring to deprive them of the p'
*ight to have their , governmeint in I
ho exercise of its constitutional f~
Kower. issue t he mon, of the nai- 1 re
iii and t control it. vtolu:.e. In e
the olpinitn' of you " conuuittee,
these events are .tartlingº, sulbvr
give of the liberties of the citizen I
lld destructive of lusine~s and hl
social security; andl adlhering to the h
O)uaha platformY in all its integrity. re
your committee insists upo(,n the
restoration of the coinage of goldl
and tsilver a.s it existed prior to tl
Is73-at the ratio of It; to 1-with- 1
out regard to the action of any c
other nation, and that all laper
money shall be issued by the gen
eral government without the in
tervention of hanks of issue, the tl
same to be a full legal tendler. h
We also declare our implacable .;
hostility to the issue of further in- c
terest-bearing bonds. .We de- s
nounce the pooling bill as -a move 1:
toward completing the monopoly (
of transportation, and demand
that, instead, congress proceed to a
iring the railroads under govern- I
ment ownership. t
The power given congress by 1
the constitution to "provide for I
the calling forth of the militia to f
execute the laws of the Union, to i
suppress insurrection, to repel in- r
vasion," does not warrant the gov- 3
ernment in making use of a stand- f
ing army in aiding monopolies in
the oppression of the public andt
their employes. When free men <
unsheath the sword it should be to t
strike for liberty, not for despot- <
ism, nor to uphold privilegedx mo- e
nopolies in the oppression of the i
poor.
We ask the people to forget all t
past political differences and unite i
with us in the common purpose to
rescue the government from the
control of monopolists and concen
trated wealth, to limit the powers
of perpetuation by curtailing their
privileges and to secure the rights
of free speech, a free press, and
trial by jury--all rules, regulations I
and judicial dicta in derogation of I
either of which are arbitrary, un- I
constitutional and not to be toler
ated by a free people.
We recommend the immediate
organization of an educational cam.
paign by the national, state and
local committees.
In addition to this address the
national committee adopted the
following resolution:
In view of the fact that the state
of Alabama aAd other southern
states are without a Republican
form of government, because of
the rule of a political oligarchy,
which is perpetuated by monstrous
frauds at the ballot-box, the im
perative necessity of a free ballot
and an honest one is a constitau
tional right, and we demand that
it be given, and move that the
chairman of the national executive
committee appoint a committee of
three to submit evidence to the
press of the country and to con
gress to substantiate this alarm.
ing and revolutionary condition,
that they may be awakened to the
threatenings of peril, caused by
this existing, autocratic anarchy in
the south.
The following were appointed:
J. O. Manning, Alabama, chair
man; Henry )D. Loyd, Illinois;
Lee Crandall, Alabama.
The above was adopted unani
mously by the conference much to
the disappointment of the two old
parties, both of which had hoped
to see a split at this meeting.--{Ed.]
If a farmer wants $1,000 he
gives 2,000 bushels of wheat, 20,
(000 pounds of cotton or a mort
gage that finally takes his farm to
get the money. If a laboring man
wants $1,000 and works every day
saving half his pay, it takes him
just about six years to get it. If
a banker wants it under the pro
posed banking law, he writes the
treasurer of the United States and
it is printed and given him. Yet
some people say you can't legislate
money into people's pockets. Slick
for the farmer and workingman,
ain't it.-Coming nation.

Under the proposed banking law
09 out of every 100 men in debt in
the nation will be bankrupted.
That will be one good feature of it.
These fellows who are hanging on
by the skin of their teeth are the
hardest fellows in the world to get
an idea. When they join the army
of out-of-works they will be in a
good condition to get interested in
the study of political economy.
Hrrah for the infamous banking
scheme. It will keep educating
the people that laws can take prop
erty away from them FaSTER than
they can make it. But they will
never believe it until all they have
is absolutely gone. The plates are
helping us.-Coming Nation.
If the banking bill passes, green.
backs will bring a premium, as
they will be the basis ofta bank. If
any of my friends are lucky enough
to have any money, they should try
and convert it into greenbacks. To
every holder of $22,500 in green
backs the government will give
$75.000 in bank notes! If you
don't believe it see how hard it
will be to try and get any green
backs. This does not aplply to
silver or coin certi8ficates. Every
dollar you leave in bank will ena.
ble the bank to get three dollars
for one. Can you take a hint?
