Bishop Durier, of Natchitoches,
Father Langlois, of St. Martinsville,

The Gazette received* a pleasant
visit from its young friend J. R.
Domengeaux, of Royville. He has
just passed a successful examination
before the Board of Pharmacy at
New Orleans, coming out first out
of a class of 17. The Gazette con
gratulates heartily its young friend.
The Southern Pacific railroad has
laid off, within the past fewdays, all
their carpenter gangs, at this point,
and several of the crews. It is an
unusual thing to lay off any one at
this time of the year, and the boys
arrt unaware whether their being
laid off-is due to the financial crisis.
However, as the crops wvill soon be
moving, it is to be hoped that they
will all be re-employed soon.
Mr. B2 ). Collins, of Algiers,
brother of Mrs. WV. E. Bowen, is in

engineer on the Macheca line, ply
ing between New Orleans and Cen

weeks ago his ship was rei'orted
lost, and he had been given up as
dead, consequently his safe return
spread joy and gladdened the hearts
of his relatives and many friends in
Algiers and Lafayette.

bf the lamented Ordway, left Breaux
Bridge in a somewhat mysterioris

Teche. Pipes is a jeweler and de

etc., belonging to some of the town 1
people, which had been left.with
him for repairs. The paper don't
say whether he carried away a Colt *
-evolvrr borrowed. froin a 'friend.'? i'
Something itnique in the way of
an entertainment will be given on
the Sth of September next 'in St.
Martinsville. • It is a mock trial
wherein all the court officers are
ladies, and is intended as a satire
on Woman's Rilhts. The perform
tnce "W tt~ iplace at the court
house, and will be in "strict com
pliance with the rigid rules of court
procedure"' It will be a novelty
well worth seeing.
G. R. Wilson, of Houston, Texas,
representing the old firm of P. C.
'tomson & Co., Philadelphia, Penn.,
has been in our city selling the fa
mous Hoe Cake Soap. A laundry
soap that softens hard water, and
washes the clothes whiter, cleaner
and in one-third the time required
when using yellow soaps. It is said
to please every, one. Give Hoe
Cake a trial and you will use no
other laundry soap. Call on your
grocer for it. The merchants we
understand will have it on sale in
twenty days.

Attempted Murder and Robbery.
A bold robbery was committed
at Iowa Junction, sixty miles west
of this point. Under the pretext
that#a white man had been run over,
Mr. O'Connell, the agent at that sta
tion, was enticed a short way out by
a negro and murderously assaulted
probably fatally. The negro re
turned to the depot and at the muzzle
of a pistol compelled Mrs. Connell
to keep quiet. The depot was then
robbed. As the station is an
isolated one Mrs. O'Connell was
compelled to remain alone until the
next train arrived, and informed
the trainmen of what had occurred.
Search was at once instituted for
Mr. O'Connell who was found lay
ing uuconscious on the track. He
and wife were taken on the caboose 1
to Welsh for medical assistahce.
Mr. Connell said that two of 'his
assaillants were white, and the third 7
being the negro who had called him.
The authorities along the fine were
wired to keep a sharp look-out and I
Ike B3roussard, our sheriff, was on
the alert, and bagged six men, two
were turned loose and as the other
four, Allen Colmnan and Joseph King,
colored, and Carl Strong and Hugh
Fenner, could not render a satisfac
tory account of themselves were held
on suspicion awaiting investigation.
Yesterday envening Mrs. Connell
accompanied by Calcasien's sheriff
and the railroad company's detec
tive came in on the evening train,
and the lady was shown the parties;
she unhesitatingly identified one of
the negroes as the one who decoyed
her husband and robbed the depot.
Col. Nicholson's Lecture.
Tihe lecture of Prof. Nicholson, j
illustrated by stereopticon views,
was delivered to a small but appre
ciative audience at the court house
last Tuesday night. The speaker
was introduced by Julian Mouton
Esq., President of the Board of
School Directors, and the Professor
then addressed the audience, dem
onstrating the character and scope
of the A. & M. University at Baton
Rouge. During the lecture views
of the buildings, grounds, class
rooms, mess halls, bedrooms, work
shops, laboratories, officers and
cadets, striking pictures of artillery
manoeuvres, concluding the series
with pictures of extinct animals,
describing each scene to the evident
interest of his hearers. We have
heard only expressions of pleasure
in regard to the lecture, and it was I
both interesting and instructive.
I will open in a few days a barber
shop near the depot. I will continue s
to run the Lombard barber shop
which will be in charge of the best t
barber in Lafayette, c

On said day I will sell such portion of said property as each debtor will point out, and in case the debtor will not point out
sufficient property, I will at once, and without further delay, sell the least quantity of said property of any debtor, which any bidder will
buy for the amount of taxes, interest and cost due by said debtor. The sale will be without appraisement, for cash, in legal tender money
of the United States, and the property sold shall he redeemable any time for the space of one year by paying the price given, with
twenty per cent and iost and penalty added.
The nortgage creditors are hereby notified that if the property to be sold is not redeemed, the sale thereof when recorded in the
conveyance or mortgage office, shall operate as a concellation of all convontional and judicial mortgages thereon.

Ah, There I
With a hand-spring, the shake of
his shillelah, and a "don't ye trade
on the tail ind av me coat" the wri
ter of the Advertiser failed dismally
in hiding his "baby act," brought
forth because the Secretary gave
The Gazette the proceedings of the
police jury first. By the way, will
the Advertiser tell the public how
and where it got its information?
For obvious reasons, we don't think
it will tell. But we'll let this pass.
The Gazette lays down the claim
that Wednesday morning is ample
time in which to hand in proceed
ings containing less than- 4500 ems,
to be inserted in a Saturday issue,
as this represents a little over five
hours work for an ordinary type-set
ter, therefore affording more than
ample time for the fulfillment of the
conditions of the contract, and lead
us to believe that every one not
biased saw through the pretext.
However, let us hasten to assure
the writer of the Advertiser and its
editor that in spite of their threats
and Bob Acresisins The Gazette in
tends to publish regilar.y tile pru
