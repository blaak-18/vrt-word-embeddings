morning train from Lake Charles
where he had gone to see Mt. S. A.
Knapp, *ho is owing himi And a
large number of citizens of Caren
cro for cane bought of them some
months ago, and also fof labor done
dh the 'eche railroatd iad- Huron
fslintation. Mr. Cfouchet failed to
get any encourttagement from Mr.
Knapp, who says that he has nothing
to do with the paymaent of the debts
and referred him to the receiver in
charge of the Teche Railroad and
Huron plantation. We are reliably
informed that some planters sold
cane to Knapp for sums amounting
to nearly $6oov and they have not
*yet received a single cent from him.
Merchants doing business in Caren
-to hold checks, signed by Knapp,
on a Lake Charles bank of which he
is or was president, but upon pre
sentation at the bank, the holders
of these checks were informed that
Knapp had no money there.
The only hope of these unfortu
nate people lies in the receiver, and
supposing that they will eventually
be paid, which is very doubtful,they
are not in a position, financially, to
wait indefinitely for their money,
which they expected to use this year
to make their crops. Many of them,
it is said, sold their cotton and with
the money from this crop, paid
hands to move their cane crop,
while others, less fortunate, bor
rowed money at a big interest.
We do not know if Mr. Knapp
intentionally deceived these people,
or if he is amenable to the laws,
but we believe the proper authori
ties should investigate this matter
and see if there is any way to bring
him to justice.
WORK UP A REPUT'A TION
It should be the aim of every
farmer who makes a spcialty of
poultry products to work up a good
reputation, for such is invaluable.
For instance, suppose a person
wishes to acquire a name for pro
ducing strictly fresh eggs. Let him
be sure his product is beyond re
proach, and then stamp eachl egg
with the name of the farm and a
guarantee as to quality. In a short
time dealers and consumers will
learn to associate the stamp with
the highest excellence, and prices
materially above regular market
rates will easily be obtained. It
pays to get individuality and separate
one's self from the rank and file in
any business, and poultry-keeping
is no exception. "There is plenty
of room at the top," and it is at the
top where the" profit is found.
THE SUGAR BOUNTY.
Complying with a resolution, the
Secretary of the Treasury on Mon
day sent to the Senate a list of
licensed producers of sugar from
beets, sorghum and sugar cane in
each State and Territory to whom
bounty has been paid and the
amount paid to each. The state
ment shows that the payments for
the current year up to March 4 have
been as follows:
Beet sugar, $6ro,935; sorghum
sugar, $16,920, cane sugar, $2,513,
597; maple sugar, $x15,597. Total,
$3,257,055. The State of Califor
nia leads in the production of beet,
sugar. Nebraska and Utah are also
producers of this kind of sugar.
Kansas and Minnesota are the only
producers of sorghum sugar, and
the latter only to a very slight extent.
Louisianba receives the bulk of the
bounty paid on cane sugar, but
Texas, Florida and Mississippi also
show an interest in the industry.
The only individual or companies
which for the year 893: received
bounty amounting to more' than
$0oo,ooo on·canmc sugar are the fol
lowing: M'itesPlanting and* Manufac
tring Company, $337,bo6; Leon
Godcheaux, $3oo,97o; Richard
Milliken, $E68,588; Caffery Central
Sugar Refinery and Railway Com
pany, $115,3s7, all of Louisiana.
A LESSON N MORALzS.
Atlanta Constitution.
A-small daily newspaper in Vir
ginia promises its readers that it
Wilipublish as little as possible about
the Pollard-Beckinridge case.
This ilu a great- mistake. The
trial is a lesson in morals, and it 'is
of incalculable educational value.
No matter what the verd#et may ber
this case will be awasningto wealthy
and prominent men who have here
ofore been under the impressii
that" they could live double lives
iand escap the penalty. If Con
Irsbm . Breckaridge, the silver
I orbr,-the pride: of Ken
j$St'" " i oh ' "" "IU11 wamd a
anad kindred subjects, must agnwer
Ro societ for his gross immorality,
isi betrayal of a frilendless girl, and
the fraud ie ihtetited upon fee
pectable ldies nto persuading them
td ihbperone Miss lidliard, it goes
without saying that other men of
high social position will be held to
an equally strict account when they
tfangress in the same way.
The woman's story is another
lesson to Vbtiteh and young girls.
It shows that the wages of sin is
death; that discove~f always comes
and that the result is disgrace and
never-ending misery.
The wide cittblicljidi of the pro
ceedings of his trial will do more
good than a hundred sermons. It
will convince both old and young
readers that a moral life is the first
requisite of safety, happiness, honor
and prosperity. The prurietnt feat
ufes of the case will be forgotten
because they ife overshadowed by
its almost tragic interest. It is far
better for young and old to know
how such intrigues turn out than to
allow them to believe that sMan of
high station may sin without punish
ment, and that reckless girls may
indulge in forbidden pleasures with
out wrecking their lives.
The Pollard Breckinridge trial is
a great moral object lesson, and
while it ruins two persons, it will
probably save thousands.

How Miuch Rain Will Wall?
The Weekly Courier-Journal has struck a
popular note in its weather guessing contests.
A wonderful amount of interest was taken in
its offer of $l,oom for the closest guesses to
the coldest day and temperature during Feb
ruary, at Louisville, and much valuable in
formation was gathered by subscribers on the
subject. This contest has just been decided,
there being i*efity-eight lucky guessers.
The Weekly Courier-Journal now mnskes
another offer on the same line. For the
closest guesses to the amount of rain that will
fall at Louisville during the month of May.
the Weekly Courier-Journal will give S),ooo.
This money will be devided into nineteen
prerents-ne of $5oo, two of Sroo each, two
of $So each, four of S25 each, and ten of ~to
each. Each guess must be accompanied by
st, to pay for one year's subscription to the
Weekly Courier'Journal, the best Democratic
paper published. The rain-fall is scienti
fically measured, to the hundredth part of an
inch. The heaviest rain-fall in May during
t'se past twenty years was seven inches and
forth-six hundredths of an inch. The lightest
was one inch even. The measurements are
made by the Government officials' of the
Weather Bureau at Louisville. Sample
copies of the paper with full particulars of
the contest, will be sent free to any address.
Write at once, as under no circumstances
will any guesses be received after April 30o.
