Since the lynching of the negro
brute at Urbana, Ohio, and the
shooting of several citizens of the
militia, the northern papers have
discovered that they are not nearly
so much opposed to lynching and
mob rule, as they thought they
were.-Lake Charles Press, Dem.
The verdict was a triumph of the
law over crime; a victory of justice
over sympathy based on false prem
ises; a proof that honest men,
whose eye of conscience is not
dimmed by illogical or untimely
appeals to their clemency, exist in
New Orleans. The finding of the
jury is a notice to men, who, by
reasons of their positions, hold
places of trust in banking institu
tions and handle funds of the pub
lic, that they cannot expect to fla
grantly violate the law's stipulations
and hope for an escape from the
consequent penalty.-Times-Demo
crat, Dem.
It seems that the United States is
not big enough and that we are to
annex Hawaii to increase our terri
tory. The annexation of these
islands will in nowise affect the
American citizen for better or
worse. It will mean the free im
portation of Hawaiian sugar for
ever and the consequent enrich
anent of the planters of that coun
try. Being sold for the same price
as our sugar, it will not affect the
market price, the tariff going into
the pockets of the planter of that
bountry. As the property of the
United States, it will be a conve
nient coaling station for the public
squadron. The question of the
annexation is one entirely for our
legislators to wrestle with, not af
fecting us in the least. The anncx
ation or not of Hawaii will in no
wise make any difference in the
price of labor or cost of food.-St.
lary Banner, Dent.
As all the world is said to love a
lover, Ensign Stone, U. S. N.,
must feel quite weighed down by
the affection -he has acquired during
his late trials. His sweet-heart
now deserts him at the commanwl of
her cruel parent, but we would like
to wager a brand-new Cupid's bow
that she will find a way to become
"Mrs. Stone" even if she has to
take two whole ocean steamers to do
it. It is safe to bet on the girl.-
St. Bernard Voice, Dem.
The general belief has been for
years past, that -"Democracy and
protection" could not be advocated
by the same person, yet the hon
ored name of Sam Randall, of
Pennsylvania is not forgotten by
the Democratic party, to which
list may now be added the name of
our junior senator, Sam McEnery.
In this connection the names of our
representatives," Messrs. Broussard,
Mayer and Davey, may be honored
as men who hold that the interests
have a stronger hold on them than
party lines.-Assumptionr Pioneer,
Dem.
* "For one, I believe in making the
country greater." This utterance
from Senator McEnery's great tariff
speech should find a place in the
platform of every American states
man. The senator is imbued with
the true American spirit. - Lake
Charles Tribune, Rep.
The great trusts don't like Sena
tor Tillman. They say he is vul
gar, that his language lacks refine
ment. O, yes I he is very vulgar
when he exposes their crimes; his
_language is the quintescence of
unchastity when he discloses their
thieving rascality in all its hideous
and corrufpting banefulness. But
the people believe in Tillman, andt
don't believe that he is vulgar or
his language objectionable. -
Shreveport Progress, Dem.
WVe most heartily commend the
faction, of our- noble- representative,
andefel confident that Senator Mc
Enery has won the approbation of
every inan who believes the wel
fare of Louisiana paramount to
other mere party considerations.
He has shown himself to be a
re~reeasatLve Senator, and as the
protperity of Louisiana must fol
low the inaugurAtaon of the policy
he supports, so will he he honored
and loved by his fortunate constit
uency. - Hon. Don. Caftery must
understand his hold upon the peo
ple by contrasting it with the ad
miration lavished on Sam D. Mc
Enery.- Opelousas Courier, Dem.

The True Reinedy.
W. M. Repine, editor Tiskilway,
Ill., "Chief," says: We won't keep
house without Dr. King's New Dis
covery for consumption, coughs
and colds. Experimented with
many others, but never got the true
remedy until we used Dr. King's
New Discovery. No other remedy
can take its place in our home, as
in it we have a certain and sure
cure for coughs, colds, whooping
cough, etc." It Is idle to experi
ment with other remedies, even if
they are urged on you as just as
good as Dr. King's New Discovery.
They are not as good, because this
remedy has a record of cures and
besides is guaranteed. It never
fails to satisfy. Trial bottles free
