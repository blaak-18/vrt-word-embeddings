From the reading of our exchanges
we infer that this is an exceptional
fine year for sugar cane. Every
where the crops are reported in a
forward condition, and the yield
promises to be the largest since the
late unpleasantness between the
States.
That enterprising merchant, B.
Ealk, shipped the first cotton of the
season from this point last Monday.
The shipment consisted of two bales
and was consigned to H. Abraham
& Son, New Orleans. This cotton
was raised by Arthur Martin and
ginned at Ernest Bernard's gin.
The first of September edition of
the Times-Democrat, with its ele
gantly lithographed cover, was a
splendid exhibition of newspaper en
terprise. Besides the news of the
day, the statistics and general re
view of the past year's business were
full and comprehensive. The Times
Democrat is a great newspaper ;
great in every department.
The business community has been.
wishing for a street sprinkler that
would lay the dust in front of their
respective establishments, and thus
save the damages caused by the dust
to their goods, to say nothing of
personal comfort. Now that they
one they should patronize liberally
the parties operating it. So far,
not many have availed themselves
of its advantages, but those who
have say they would not ISe without
it.
In a conversation with Mr. J. H.
Humble some days since, it was
learned that if the people of Lafay
ette will give a suitable site and right
of way for switch, and guarantee to
the mill the yield of 2000 acres of
cane, and agree to sell same, the
first year, at the same price paid by'
other refineries, less freight, the
Ferris 'Manufacturing Company
would put up a refinery plant. Here
is food for thought.
The col Pic" was right in the
swim on the first of September.
Its pages teemed with a splendid
write-up of the past year's business,
full and accurate, and its patrons
were proud of the "old lady."
Though old in years, she is strong
in the gathering of news, and it is
indeed a cold day when she gets
left on any piece of important news.
As a detective Sheriff Broussard
of Lafayette parish would do credit
to any force in the United States.
The skill and judgement he displayed
last week in Lafayette in capturing
the two negroes who had robbed the
agent at Iowa station, is a piece of
detective work for which the Sheriff
deserves special praise. Lafayette
parish should see to it that Sheriff
Broussard is retained in his present
position.--R. 'ne Ranger.
Mr. Alfred Hebert received last
week by express from Missouri a
fine pedigreed Poland-China sow,
and on which the express charges
were $18. The price paid for the
sow was $o50. This at first glance
appears to be a high price, but it is
not, for the reason that from the
first litter he may recoup himself
for his outlay. Some time since we
were afforded the opportunity to
visit his hog range, and it was clearly
demonstrated to us that it is possi
ble to raise pork here at very remu
nerative prices.
The Gazette had the pleasure to
witness, last Thursday, in St. MIar
tinsville, a novel entertainment. It
was a mock trial, conducted by
young ladies representing court offi
cers and attorneys, and is a satire
on woman's rights. The prologue
delivered with fine effect by Miss
Lucy Hart, was full of hits, and the
whole piece provoked much laugh
ter. The court house was scarcely
large enough to afford room for the
arge audience in attendance. After
he entertainment a ball took place
in the high school building and the
music was furnished by the St. Mar
tinsville string band, said to be one
of the best in the State. The entire
management of the affair was in the
hands of the efficient superintendent
oaf publice instruction, Mr. P. D.
Olivier, and was given for the pur
pose of raising funds to furnish the
high school building. It was a
grand success financially as well as
pleasurably.
Mr. Gus.. Lacoste has received
some fine wagons which .he offers

Carencro News.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
-"Fly time" is over, and busi
ness has opened up.
-Cotton has been coming in with
a rush. The two gins in town
handled forty-one loads of the staple
last Saturday.
-Cane has been set back a little
by the recent dry and cold spell.
-Prof. Falk, of New Orleans,
has been engaged to take charge of
St. Peters parochial school. Both
the schools, for boys and girls have
been fitted up nicely and comfortably
by Father Laforest. Prof. Falk
comes with the highest recommen
dations as a thorough pedagogue.
-Certain progressive merchants
of our less progressive sister Lafa
yette, having a desire to set forth
the present and future advantages
offered by their town for investors,
have had their business envelopes
ornamented with a "cut" of a map
of the parish. The existing and
several imaginary railroad routes
are shown. A couple of towns of
adjoining parishes showing their
location in very neat type; but the
designer or engraver, either acci
dentally or intentionally seemed to
ignore or overlook the fact that the
towns of Carencro and Royville,
though smaller than our "county
seat," is nevertheless part and par
cel of the glorious old parish of
Lafayette, and at least deserve hav
ing their location designated on
their ingenious little map. Had
this been done, persons in search of
reliable Information, would have
discovered that Royville and Caren
cro are the centres of those sections
of the parish, which make it what
it is to day, glorious as to scenery
perfect as to lealth, an agricultural
wonder, and the greatest parish in
the State. The great city of Lafa
yette seems eaten uip by a desire to
ignore its smaller sisters, but the
,"buzzard" will overtake the "'snail"
as sure as the sun shines.
-Mr. A. Cheffer, our lumber
king, keeps in stock everything
that could possibly be called for in
the building material line. People
from Sunset, Arnaudville, Belleview,
Scott, and even L.afayette come
to him to make their purchases.
-Your correspondent is indebted
to Mr. Adam Saunier for a "carrot"
of tobacco, raised and prepared
by himself. His method of prepa
ration makes it fully equal to "'Vir
ginia Extra," possessing the same
color and flavor.
Hon. A. J. Guilbeau, of Breaux
Bridge was a visitor to our town
this week.
-Since Conductor Fritz has been
elected a "vice president" it is al
most impossible to approach him.
But just wait a little, this coming
winter's rush of business, will rub
all that high toned polish off. Con
ductors Lusted and Parrott, Judge
Coffey and Mr. Felix Landry form a
splendid quartette, that would fill
the breast of a nightingale with envy.
-Messrs Geo. E. Brown, Geo.
Melchior, S. P. Brown and Fred
Jones, visited New Iberia last Sun
(lay.
-The Coulee Croche and Caren
cro base ball clubs, played a game
of ball on the Church grounds last
Sunday with the following result.
Carencro, 4 innings, 5 runs; Coulee
Croche, 5 innings, 23 runs. The
Carencro team claim they could
have done even better, with a little
practice. Tlhis club is to fightitout
on the ''diamond" with the ''crack"
team of Grand Coteau on Sunday
Sept. I7th.
-Mr. H. MIouton was in Caren
cro last Sunday, and passed the
evening chatting with friends, and
witnessing the base ball game.

of as fine rice as was ever harvested.
-The Oplelousas Bycicle Club
will make their "century" run from
their city to New Iberia on Sunday
the 27th inst. They will pass
through Carencro. It will prove a
very pretty and interesting sight.

the Carencro school returned home
last Sunday. She visited the Chicago
Fair, and spent some time with
relatives and friends in Terrebonne.
-Mr. Leonard Robin cotton
factor and merchant of New Orleans

Monday to enter Springhill College.

much so, that Sunday night whilst

in it and tumbled over, precipitating

paired) to hear of some one getting
either killed or crippled. Will the
police jury attend to this.

Broussard and Leah Landry returned

brier, Hon. H. Theall, O. Theriot,

you friend.

Deputy Sheriffs Hebert Billeaud
and S. Bernard arrested Wednesday
in Abbeville, a man named 'Williams
Watkins charged with horse stealing,
and gave him free lodging in Ike's
Hotel. The affidavit was made by
Sam Smith who claims that he
bought the horse from Watkins,
but it seems the horse is the property
of Henry Jones, a negro from Que
Tortue and disappeared from his
premises, and in finding him in the
possession of Sam Smith, made a
demand for his property, and upon
being refused proceeded to have
Smith arrested. Smith is in jail.
Watkins acknowledges to have sold
the horse to Smith but says he
bought the animal in Iberia. Wat
kins father is expected today to
furnish bail for his son.
The jailor informs The Gazette
that there are at present thirteen
prisoners detained in the parish lail.
