An. exchange says: "A Democrat in
Virginia has declined a certificate of
election to Congress that was awarded
to him on account of clerical irregular
ities in the returns, and his Republican
competitor gets the place. And yet
there are those who insist that miracles
never happen nowadays." That man
should go at once into some popular
dime museum as the greatest freak of
the age.
Postmaster General Wilson said. at a
meeting in New York last week that
"the honest belief of a large section
of the voters is becoming fixed that the
government is so administered and
laws are so framed as to make unjust
distribution of social benefits, to make
more dificult the upward path in life,
and to narrow the gateway of oppor
tonity." That expresses the situation
fi general terms, but it specifies no
Particular evils and suggests no rem
edy. What we need is to get at the
situation in a concrete way.
The Populist party has also been use

DYING IN DESPAIR.
STARVATION DRIVES MANY TO
COMMIT SUICIDE.
Weary of the Struggle Against Poverty
They Seek Rest In the Grave-Victims
of a Nation's Folly Sacrificed to the
Rich Man.
Chicago special: No longer are want
and suffering known in this broad and
happy land; no longer are sin and
sorrow the legacies left by poverty to
the children of despair. The "wild and
hideous dream" of free silver has faded
from the minds of men. Protection and
prosperity have come, as Mark Hanna
promised they would.
Gold has bein crowned the monarch
of the western world.
The trusts, the syndicates, the Wall
street gamble",-d watered stocks, the
brokers in bonds and the pawnbrokers
who pretend they are bankers because
they lend money on mortgages instead
of on watches and diamonds-these and
all others who live in idleness by filch
ing from the products of industry, have
declared that with the coronation of
gold would come confidence, the great
courier of prosperity.
Mills were to be opened to Amer
ican workmen. The old, familiar "hum
of industry" was to be heard in fac
tory and in workshop. "Confidence"
would start the fires and send the
smoke upward from every idle chim
ney. The "endless chain" of commerce
would bring into every line of indus
try the.millions paid to labor. Prices
would go up, every toiler would be paid
higher wages in a "sound money" and
"national honor" would be preserved.
The story is an old one now. The
American people permitted coercion,
intimidation, purchase and falsehood
to defeat the ideas of liberty, justice
and humanity.
Herewith is given a very incomplete
and partial list of people in Chicago
who have committed suicide since Nov.
15, or nearly two weeks after the elec
tion ushered in the era of prosperity.
The list is strictly confined to those
that hopeless poverty and despairing
hunger have driven to bay at last.
Millionaires and plutocrats may sneer
but the awful fact remains that when
hulger and suffering and want to-day
are unsuatalied by any hope for to

employment. While in this melan- a
choly contemplation he seized a revol- I
ver and fired a bullet into his heart.
Death must have been instantaneous,
but his uody was not found until nearly
noon.
John M. Faulhaber of 526 NorthClark I
street, died Thanksgiving afternoon I
from blood poisoning. While despond- 1
ent over the business outlook he at
tempted to end his life and his wounds 1
eventually brought his desire.
After searching for weeks in a vain
effort to find work and fearing that his
little home would be sold under the I
auetioneer's hammer, Max Voigt, a
carpenter, who lived at 301 Lee ave
nue, ended his life November 28 by I
swallowing a quantity of carbolic acid.
Voigt left the house at 7 o'clok in the
morning in search of employment. Af
ter tramping about the city all day he
returned in the evening, but instead
of going into the house. went to the
basement below and there took the poi
son that ended at once his life and his
troubles.
Anthony T. Harris, aged 60 years,
attempted to commit suicide November
28 by shooting. Harris lived at 8942
Dauphin avenue. The cause of the act
is said to be despondency over his ina
bility to make a living.
Peter J. Toenos, 'an aged German,
was found dying from staryation and
exposure in his little room in the rear
of 815 West Fiftieth place at noon No
vember 30. When kind hands lifted
him from the bare floor, where he had
fallen face downward in his weakness,
and sought to minister to his needs,
the spark of life fled. He had survived
forty-eight hours of bitter cold in the
unheated apartment and died as relief
was at hand.
The report of the -board of health
shows that during the entire month of
November twenty-eight people com
mitted suicide in Chiago. Over half of
these killed themselves because they
preferred a quick death by drowning,
by poison or by the pistol to a linger
ing one by starvation.
NOTES AND COMMENT.
What the People Are Thlnklng, ayling
and Doing.
Anent the talk now going on in
wealthy commercial centergwith regard
to the destruction of the greenbacks, it
is well to see just what such .action
would lead to. It is said thatwe arenow
on a gold standard, and in one sense it
is true. It is claimed that all other cur
rency depends upon gold to sustain
its value. It would be more appro
priate to say that it depended more up
on credit. -
There is said to be in circulation,
aside from gold, about $1,112,000,000 in
currency. It is claimed that this is
kept at par 'with gold by the simple
existence of the $123,000,000 of gold in
the treasury. That is to say that
every dollar of the $1,112,000,000 is
exchangeable for gold. It is plain to
see that the only honest basis for a pa
per currency, itf it is to be based upon
another kind of money, is dollar for
dollar. This would leave nearly $1;000,
1 000,000 of our-currency without. a base,
unless It was on the credit of the United
States.

answers the same purpose and is much
more convenient. And no sane man
demands that the gold shall be kept
in the treasury simply for a show.
"Move on! Move on." Those words
have been ringing in the ears of poor
Matilda Koch for five years. She had TI
heard them in Fort Wayne. Ind., in In
dianapolis, in Columbus, Ohio, in Pitts
burg, in Philadelphia, and in New
York.
"Move on!" said Policeman Sheldon
to her as she stood at the foot of Des- el
brosses street on Thursday night.
"Move on, and be quick about it."
Poor Matilda Koch obeyed, but her
footsteps were faltering, her manner
aimless. She had no home, no friends, T
nowhere to go, nothing to do but to
"move on." The policeman arrested 1:
her as a vagrant, and she was arraign
ed in the Center Street Police Court
yesterday. F
"It's the same old story," she said,
weeping. "It's always 'move on,' and A
when I don't move enough or far
enough I am arrested. Why should I 6
be dragged into a station house like a
dangerous criminal and be locked up? S
Why am I driven from city to city, G
from prison to prison? Is it a crime to
be poor? Who is to blame for my
poverty? Certainly not I. Society has
ostracised me as though I were a leper 1
-all because I am poor.
"Five years ago I came to America j]
from Germany with my husband and
settled in Fort Wayne. A year ago he
died and all my money went for doc
tors' bills.' It left me destitute. I tried c
to earn a living, but I was too weak. 3
Then I was declared a 'poor person'
and was driven out of town. They put
me on a train and sent me to Indian
apolis. They would not have me there c
and I was again bundled into a sec
ond class 'car and sent to Columbus. 1
From Columbus I was moved to Can- 1
ton, from Canton to Pittsburg, from I
Pittsburg to Philadelphia, and from I
Philadelphia to this city. It is always i
mnove on,' 'move on,' 'move on.' " I

Wevler qf the Mint.
Director of the Mint, Preston, threat
ens to make liars out of Blaine, Gar
field, Grant and a host of others who
have made public declarations that it
was not generally known that the
"crime of '73" was being committed by
the passage of the coinage act that
dropped the standard silver dollar. A
recent dispatch from Washington
says:
The official history of the change in
the coinage law made in 1873 will be
included in the annual report of the
director of the mint for the fiscal year
1896. Director Preston has been search
ing the. fles of the treasury and of
congress for every scrap of data bear
ing on the subject,"and will make the
most complete presentation of facts and
documents which has ever been at
tempted.
He has found a copy of the original
draft of the proposed coinage law,
which was sent to congress by Mr.
John Jay Knox, when comptroller of
the currency, with changes interlined
by Mr. Knox in his own handwriting.
It was only after a long search that
'this draft of the bill was found in the
assay otffice at New York, where it had
been sent to obtain the views of the
assayer. This original draft provided
for reducing the silver dollar to a to
ken coin of the same finish and propor'
Stiozi of silver as otiher subsidiary coins.
I The dollar was not in circulation, be
r cause the high price of silver then rul
. aing made it more valuable than the
Sgold dollar, even if the country had not
been upon a paper basis. The commit
Stee of congress which dealt with the
bill dropped oiut the dollar altogether,
but retained the limitation of legal
tender. power to $5, which Mr. Knox
had proposed for all the silver coins.
SThe subsequent action of congress in
adopting a trade dollar for use in China
Sis well knowna.
SDirector Preston will present coples
Sof the coinage l1w in its several stages
and the correspondence which took
Splace betweii the treasury officials and
Scommittee of congress, showing that
Sthe purpose of the bi!l was thoroughly
understood at every. stage of its con:

Don, away back there. seated on his
war horse, Rosinante, followed by his
faithful Sancho, on his ass-charged
the "Wind mills, for the space of a

charge and smiled. And now, in the

head to foot, shouting-"Silver the is

(Bunco) on his ass, the twain bellow
ing, "Subordinate everything to 're
monetizing' silver."-Ludificarl Fallere.
They' assault the "Gold bug wind mill"
-the other half of the false bases.
And the "mill," as in the case of
first Don, withstood the assault and
laughed at the push on gold, which is
"sound" wind.
And as the scattered, scar-worn vic
tims, of the "silver alone issue," gath
ered their spoils from the ensanguined

Nov. 3 Was Only a Bull Run.
The Silver Knight of Cleveland, 0.,
makes the following sensible observa
tion:
"There are those of us old enough
to remember the wave of disappoint
ment, almost of despair, that swept
over the country when the news
came of the defeat of Bull Run. But
it was not many years before we re
alized that the defeat was a God-send.
If the Union troops had won at Bull
Run the war would have closed on just
one more compromise and nothing
would have been settled. There is a
broader issue than the silver question,
and that is the money question. De
feated in the first fight on the silver
question, it behooves us to discuss the
money question, of which the silver
question is but a part. The power to
issue money must be taken out of pri
vate hands, and all that circulates as
money, whether gold, silver or paper,
must be issued by the federal govern
ment exclusively. We must stand for
the treatment of silver on, an equality
with gold at the mints, because silver
was never constitutionally demonetized
and discriminated against, and those
unconstitutional laws degrading silver
from standard money to token coin
must be swept from the statute book.
The government is under obligation to
coin gold and to coin silver into stand
ard money, and it may coin paper, but'
it has no authority to indorse the notes
of any banking corporation."
Government Telegraphy.
"There is now pending before Con
gress a bill providing for a Govern
ment telegraph, which will come up for
further consideration at the next ses
sion of Congress. The bill owes its
existence to the International Typo
graphical Union, which for years has
f fought a valiant battle for a national
telegraph system. The bill, if passed,
will cause the operation of a telegraph
by the government on a cost basis, and
free from the discrimination so fre
quently practiced by the Western
Union monopoly. The news, freed
e from the grasp of this octopus (which
t consults its own interests and not the
people's as to whether newspapers are
needed in certain localities or not, and
Sacts accordingly),daily newspapers will
springup like magic all over the United
e States-publications not tinged with
the monopolistic hue of the Western
Union, but papers that Are free td ad
vocate true 'peform measures without
fear of losing the necessary comple
s ment, to their business, the news."
I Telegraphers' Advocate.
And there's some more Populism for
you. But It is no new idea. In fact,
a there isn't a single Populist principle
e that is new. We are simply a party of
the people, of advanced ideas, and want
to adopt the best and reject the worst
h of all the governments in the world.
It would be no trouble to do.so if It
were not for the pecuniary interests of
-the wealthy.
Condition or Iron ilnersr.
SA correspondent- ot the Telegraphers'
SAdvocate says;
Not long since I wrote upon the coan
dition of the iron miners in,Michigan.
SAt that time they were sting dogs, and
Sthe governor proposed, in case they at*
tempted to secure any other food by
Sother means than those prdesacribed by
their masters, to send the entie state
Smilitia up for the purpose of giving
them a good dinner of bullets. It seems,
however, that this will not be required.
since the daily papers bring the cheer
ins news that the miners are peaceaillY
starving to death. The Times-Herald
says thousands are starving upon the
SGogebic range, and unless assistance is
given them this winter, that'the snow
will drift over the graves of hundreds
of paupers who died from.lack of food.
Today, with the harbingers of winter in
the air, there are strong, willing work
ers prowling about looking.for a bit:
of refuse that will answer tie purpose
Sof food-who are hunting deperately
Sfor work-thousands of hollow eyed
women seeking in vain to still the cries
of their famishing brood, thousands
,upon thousands of helpless little chil
Sdren, without shoes, clothing or educa
tion, and unable to comprehend why it
does not come, upon the Gogeble iron
range.
It is some consolation, however, that
al the constant agitation of ecbnoinc
e questions is attracting the notice of
such prominent men as Mr, Wilson.
The Populist party has been to the ftoe
in this matter., It forces a considera
tion of the income tax and secured
b- the passage of a law for that npurpose.
The adverse decision of the Sulpreme
Court only eimphasized the justice of
- another one of the problems the party
ri has uublicly, diseUssed--tiet qo~ the
.powers of the' courts, and tieir aggrese
4 siena upon the rights of the people.
