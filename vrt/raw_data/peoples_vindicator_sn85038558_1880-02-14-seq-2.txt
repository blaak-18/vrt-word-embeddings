Some time during ilst Summer
while the State of Tennessee was en
gaged Ia an election in which the
payment of the bonds of that State,
at fifty cents on the dollar, wil b four
per cent interest was involved, the
advocates of a high tax and no com
promise threatened the low tex par
ty, by pointing to the attitude about
to be asumed by the State of New
Hampbhire. It seems now, that this
State has at last determined to as
same the role of the avenger, and
uga o f all financial heresies, par
lbcularly In Southern States, and has
deliberately selected Louislana as
her first victim. Under a recent act
of the legislature any eltizen of New
'Hampsbhre who owns a bond of any
other State. on which payment lan
full has failed'or refused to have
been made, may, for a nominal con
sideration transfer his claims to the
State for the purpose of having suit
brought upon them nla the Federal
Courts. Should New Hampshire
suessed In getting judgment In favor
of her protege, then the bonds are to
be r-ononveyed to the actual owner.
What lntelet in the suit New Hamp
shire May have, does not appear up
on the surface. Let us examine a
moment and see what are the proba
ble Interests that may accrue to New
Hampshire in these suits. The pres
eat suit against Louisiana Is said to
be based upon only three bonds of
this State held by citizens of New
Hampshire, and only for the differ
ense between seven per cent later
et, as expressed in the bonds, and
the present rate of interest as fixed
ton our New Constitution. This is
only an litiatory step, or tentative
esperlment on the part of New
Hampshire. If, with the help of an
eight by seven Federal Court, she
sbould succeed in this case, New
Hampshire will soon become the
asylum and city of refuge for every
holder ofl outhern bonds. The ag
gregate Indebtedness of Virginia,
Tennesseesad Louisiana, Is in round
anumbers about $65,000,000. This, at
sli percent nlaterest, a low estimate,
would bring Into the State of New
Hampshire four and a half millions
of dolleas annually. This indebted
ness In all probability will continue
for at least fifty years, by which
time, should the prinelpal and inter
est be paid, New Hampshire will
have absorbed three hundred mil
lions of dollar.
It willthbuappear that New Ramp
sre is on the highway to wealth
and ue, proviled, she thoroughly
usdesltands the science of addition,
divisiones and silence. Should she be
urtunaMtely deficient In this branch
of the e arts, she will do well to
gather to her maternal bosom a few
of the Radical ezs-oeials of Louisi
a m, whos fame In this peculiar
branch of art is world-wide. These

knew be was Ipelltible when be pe'
mittled hblmself to be nomlnated flr a
seat in the House; that he came h ret
with bis eyes open, and that. it would
be improper to charge the State with
his expenses. The mileagls and per
diem asked for was, therefore rfets
ed. Youg has misreiresented Lin
islana f ur years in her legislat ve
ajaigl. It is safe to say that he will
never do so -igain.
The House also disposed of the
enantested ease from Assumption,
wherein Dupaty and Dugas Demo
erats, claimed the seats occupied by
Bulow and Gardner, RepublIcans.
The only point in the ease was, that
on election day there was ball-dohsng
and intimidation at the Napoleon
ville poll. whereby whire sad colored
Dem,,crats were prevented from ast
ing their vote. If this poll was
thrown out Dupaty sad Daias
would be elected, and they asked, on
the grounds stated, for seats In the
House. The ease did not require
much conslderation. Assumption is
one of tbhe parishes in which the
races are almost equally dhide, and,
a; Mr. Kavanough, of 8. Landry,
said In the debate. If 14,00 white
men permit themselves or Demo
cratlc negroes to be hulldosed by an
equal number of Republican ae
groes, they deserve to be bulldosed.
The House seems to have aceepted
this view of the matter, for the claim
of Dupatv and Duar was set aside.
and Bulow and Gardner confirmed
in their sests.
In Jefferson parish on the nlght
succeeding the election two ballot
boxes were destroyed, and the Seer
tary of State was unable to certify as
to who was elected. The Commlt
tee on Elections took the case under
consideration, Mr. Gardere, the
Democratic candidate, testifed that
in the other boxes of the parish,
Roech, the colored R-publican ean
date, had received a majority of over
310, and that he believed, bealso had
a maj ,rty in the two boxes destroy
ed. R.oaeh was consequently sworn
in as a member of the Howuse yester
day.
The contested election ease of Laue
vs. Brian, from the Wlnn Senatorial
District, will come up In the Senate
on Monday. The other cases have
not been set for a bearing.

OBSERVER.
Frank Leslle's Sunday Magazine.
The March number is promptly on
our table, taking precedence of all
its contemporaries. It is, in every
respect, most admirable one; a rell
gious, pure and moral tone prevales
Lts pages, and still they abound with
articles which appea to all tastes
and all classes, and from the perusal
of which the reader cannot fail to
derive both enterTainment and edi*
fication. There are so many good
things that it is dilfeult to select the .
most notable features. The openinlo
artlole. by Hart Litton, entitled "Es.
ther Brandon's Mission Class" is a
very pleasdR narrative of the lady's
experlie e i the Miesion. "The
Puritan Revolution," by Rev. Laman
Abbott, is replete with the stirring
incidents resulting in the organiz- :
tion of the Puritan party under :
Cromwell. Those admirable articles
on "The Persecutions," by Alfred H.
Guernsey, are concluded in this num
her with a most interesting paper on
"The Persecutions of the RHuue
nots," in France under Louis XIV.
The two very interesting serials.
"Be-Be, the Nallmaker's Daughter"
and "Little Binges," are continued, I
and there are several short stories by
popular writers. 't he subject (No.
8) of "The Children of the Bible."
is "Iesaa, the Child of Promise."
An elaborate article on the late
Frank Leslie, by the editor (with 11
lustrations,) is a beautiful tribute to
the . rtistle and personal merit of the
deceased. There are poems of great
excellence, sketehes, essays, adven
tures, etc., and a nusical cooposi-.
tion, "I Have a Glorious Hope,"
