Jefferson was the first President -
auguiated at Waslinggons - -t tlft
time Pennsylvanfa avenue was 'but a
spongy track, 'along which the alder
bushes had been slashed away to the
vridth call for by Major L'Enfant's
plan of the ity. - ,The few inhabitants
that- the city had were lodged in two
grops, one abount the Capital and the
other beyond the ~lteeutive MMansion to
ya~rdcl rg tovii. The inauguralroute
was a.aesc > zn and Jefferson. clad in

Jneksu's Procellon. -
General Jackson's- famous inapgnra'
tion took place on a Thursday. March 4
1829. The day waes mild, the sky`;...
In accordance with the custom of thi
and later .tmes Jackson had formally
notified -te'tenate of his iattention'to
take the th in its presence.' - Nowa
days the'henate appoints its committee
f arrangements and publishes. its order
of ceremonies upon mere assumption
that -the President elect desires the
aSsimtance r! tlh Sei a te---one'" moare
proof of the solidifying .effects of cus
tom. At this time Pennsylvania avenue
had a rough stone pakement on the
south side of it, while. the ceptre space
of about forty-five feet in width was
lined on either side with Lombardy
poplar trees, planted a qhartcr of a cen
-tury before through the fostering care
of Jefferson. The inaugural procerssion
that moved along this boulevard was a
spontaneous and informal one, the only
prominent figure in it. being that of
Jackson himself on a prancing steed.
Great as the cro*d of visitors'was for
that day and geieration, 'the President
elect did not look down on many more
than ten thousand faces as he delivered
his inaugural address. In view of
present discussion of the propriety of
returning to what President 1zaye
called " the pradtife of the fathezs ' in
appointing. to office, it will not be with
out a certain interest to recall what
Jackson said upon this oceasian touch
ing thh same .topic. These are his
word . -
The recent. demonstration of public
.sentiment -inscribes on the listofexecu
tive duties, in characters too legible to
be overlooked,, the task of reform,
w hich will require particularly the cor
rection of those abustaM that have
ýbrought the patronage of the -federal
overnme~nt into .conflicts -with- the
Seedom of ieections and'the coadfter
actions of those causes which have dis
turbed this rightful course of appoint
ment and have placed a aontinued pow
erin unfaithful or incompetent hands.

-Therewere no military from abroa4,
but Western men swarmed the streets,
many of whom had come with a vague,
indefinite purpoe of seeing their leader.
safely through the ordeal of inaugura
tion amid strangers and enemies, and
many others with an idea of turning to
practical account whatever -degree of
acquaintance they had with the most
accessible and sociable of men. whose
"litphathring" was "always on the out
side," and. who knew, recognized and
Iwelcomed everybody.
A peculiarity of this crowd was that
it was a "cold water " one. The, en
thusiasm of the hosts that had shouted
Jackson, Harrison and Taylor into'office
found frequent vent and refreshment ii
the barrooms of the federal capital; but
these men of the Northwest who had
followed Abraham Lincoln to Washing
ton were quiet, earnest. abstemious
men, wo. -washed down thei ,ard,
greasy and unwholesome fare which -he
cheap restaurants and boarding houses
provide at such times with, copious
draughts opump water, or moistened
it with so ed tea and coffee during
the progresi of the meal.
GranVt's uagU.ural ofa.
(rant's first inauguration was so much
surpassed by his second as to have suf
fered an eclipse as a subict for spectac
ular description. A drizzling rain and
muddy streets made -things uncomfort
a1ble, anid. the waiting crowds would
have cheered as lustily the passing pro
cession even had the conspicuous agure
in it been less renowned and popular
and the military display less fine. But
even as President Grant - sought and
accepted hissecond election as a national
vindication of his civil career, so his'
friends resolved to make his reinstalla
tion . Matter of national interest.
