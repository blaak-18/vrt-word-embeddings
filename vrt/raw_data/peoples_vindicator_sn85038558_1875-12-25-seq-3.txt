it doies not coitine itsel i'entlirely to tihle
reproedlution of lnatiltve arct. Its lissiionl
is to cultivate si iiroi;id ;iand a itillt5:i tive

The artistic illustration of American
scenery, original wit h THIIE ALDIINE, is.
an important feature. and its magnificent
plates are of a size Ior;llpprolpriate to
the saltisfailtor treutmenllt of details
thani can be athiorte!cd by any inferior
lipale. The judicious interspersion of
llldsciape, nlmarine, figure, aind animall
suhjects, sustain an unalated interest,
imlpossible whre the scope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of siliject.+ The literature of TllHE
ALDINE is ai light lnd gl raceful accoln- l
paniment, worthy of the artistic ftea
tircs, with only such technical dlisgrisi
tioins as do not inlterllro with the popul
lar interest of the work.
