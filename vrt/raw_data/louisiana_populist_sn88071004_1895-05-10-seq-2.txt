et Frater.
A trifle more than two brief
Syears ago the G;overnor of the
T. State of Louisiana, Murphy J.
Foster, in a public speech, with
much scorn of lip and virtuous up
r. turning of e)e, removed John
Fitzpatrick from the pale of hon
orable recognition among men, by
0 branding the present chief execu
1 tive of this city as a "self-confess
40 ed spy.' Since then, times. and
men, too, have changed. Spies,
i albeit self-confessed spies, occupy
- the tent and share the boe and
board of the gubernatorial gene
ral, planning the confidential de
p tails of a cam lign which is to deo
1 liver over to the Roman of Baton
o Rouge and the ('arthagenian of
_ New Orleans the province of Lou
isiana for further political ravages.
Turk and Christian now lie in
the same benl, eat from the same
table, hold confidential converse
within the non-echoing walls of the
room that tells no tales. Why is
this thus? Or, is it really thus?
Iet us see.
I' In May, 1894, the State Logisla
ture of this political province-
the subject of controversy is the
"self-confessed spy" era-met at
I Baton Rouge. His "Combine"
excellency, the chief executive of
Louisiana, had appointed Donel
* son Caffery and Newton C. Blanch
ard United States Senators to fill
existing vacancies. These two dis
tinguis'led gentlemen were the
3. "Foster" candidates to succeed
,f themselves. What spectacle was
presented in the vote for Sena
tors. Evt-v member of the city
e ring, dominated by John Fitzpat
rick, the "self-confessea spy," vo
ted for the men whom Murphy J.
Foster, with an ipso dixit that
brooked no restraint, had declared
g should be Louisiana's representa
tives in the upper house of the na
d tional legislature.
The Hon. Charles J. Boatner, a
few brief moons agone, was John
Fitzpatrick's personal and political
friend. Every consideration of
v fidelity dictated that with Boatner
a candidate against Blanchard,
John Fitzpatrick's support should
go to him freely and without stint.
But when the "man from St. Ma
ry" mid Blanchard, the "me, too,"
of the Cresent City boss was heard
to resound through the legislative
balls and corridors at Baton Rouge.
Had the "self-confessed spy" learn
ed to love the "hero of the levee
troubles," or were these Damon
and Pythias stateasmen measuring
by a quid pro quo yard stick ? )oes
- John Fitzpatrick give something
for nothing Does Foster give
t something for nothing No. Each
.,has what the other must have.
The Registration Oflice-the Zach
arie department of the State gov
ernment, with its marvellous pow- t
er of sudden transformation from
the India rubber man towards its
political friends, to the man of n
imron towards its political foes-is
within the control of that execu
tive from whose lips came the
"self-confessed spy" only some
thirty months ago. This registra
tion ofece is his to give-his sense
of ownership is such that he may
bequeath it to those who come af
ter him. And John Fitp·atrick r

id MORE ELECTION RETURNS.
The Flag Being Planted Where It
Hlas Never Waved Before.
- ('lean Sweeps at
e- the Polls.
of As the returns from the wagon
train conime in it becomes all the
more certain that the Populist par
Le ty is not "dead," as declared by
se some of the reckless organs of the
e old parties.
While making those assertions
the organs magnanimously ignore
the evidences of continued life as
manifested in the election returns.
a- This is the kind of information
which they don't want to dispense
to their readers, because it might
destroy a delusion.
The Populists, however, seem to
have been attending strictly to bu
sinesw all along the line at the
i spring elections and at every poll
ing place made their influence felt
s- either by a victory or a close con
'e test.
In the list of victories achieved
' Colorado leads the procession.
' The returns in that State show the
,y following result:
t- Leadville-Entire ticket elected.
Pitkin-A sweeping victory.
Victor.-The entire People's par
ty ticket was elected.
Silverton. ---The Populist won
every office in town.
Louisville.-There was only one
ticket in the fieki, all Populists,
a and the whole town moard is now
of that party. t
Rockville.--A complete victory. t
New Castle.-With one or two
exceptions the Populists won every
d thing.
Red Cliff.-There was but one
ticket in the field, the Populist. i
Florence.-The People's ticket, t
d headed by Thomas Robinson, pres- c
ent mayor of the city, was re-elect- 4
e ed.
St. Elmore-- The Populists
elected their entire ticket.
e Lake City.---The Populist ticket a
was the only one in the field and I
9 received all the votes. c
Oury.-The Populist being the u
only ticket in the field, the election I
b passed off very quietly.
Castle Rock.-The People's tick- f
et being the only one in the field,
was elected. I
Altman.--The entire Populist t
- ticket was elected by a big majority. t
LaFayette.-The usual Populist a
Smajority was given. t
Alma.-The town election in a
Alma yesterday resulted in the il
election of W. II. Poyless, Popu
e list, for mayor, and Mrs. Ellen i,
Hunter, Populist, was elected treas- h
urer. The board now stands three t(
SPopulists and three Republicans,
with a Populist mayor and treasu- a
rer.
Rico.-The Populists got every tl
man except one trustee, and he a
was elected by one majority.
Aspen.-It was a comple Popu
list victory. The Populists have
a ihod in Aspen which no power
can shake, and will administer the t
affairs of the city in a business- e:
like manner. B
Mount Dora, Fla., went Popu- hI
list by a large majority. U
In Illinois the Popolistelected a E
large anmber of county supervi- di
sora. Decisive victories were a
achieved at Malone, Onieda and is
SSprin Valley. ,
Michigan follows Colorado closem
in the number of victories.. In 0
Henrietta, that state, the Popalists bi
elected the county supervisors and I
Iarl victories were also won in th
LieryTompkins Springport, ta
Hanover, Whitmors and Kalama
seoe ounties. t
Last year Julius Caesar Bur- fr
rows, Republican, was elected to fu
Cnres from the Third Michigan I
distrct by 12,000 plurality. This
year A. M. Toddu Poplist, put d
the epublion majoritny down to &t

B)'s. have you seen anything of
that prosperity the D)eimocr:ts
promised us?
(;Guess it has been "scooped" up
by the bankers. As they have
; complete controle of the l)emoerat
ic party, they are sure to get the
It good things made by that party.
You know yourselves that if you
have a cow that gives just enough
milk for your own use, you are
not going to feed and milk this cow
and give the milk to some one else.
in Now these bankers are not going
r- to pay the G. O. P. Bosses big
,y money to feed the people on prom
me ises of prosperity in order to get
another "chance," and then give
e the people the benefit of this
s "chance."
. Now, if you really want pros
n Iperity, you had better come right
out and vote for a party that can
give it directly to the people, and
o not to a set of money syndicates
I- that may distribute it to the peo
ple as they see fit.
It I know that you would hate to
. leave the old party that you have
waved your hat and yelled for so
d long, but it must be done, or we
t* will have a ruined nation. We are
`e about as far as we can go without a
1. revolution, and if you would rath
er have a happy and prosperous
people, you will come and vote the
Populist ticket next election.

v We have repeatedly said that
this free silver, one-plank bastard
' that is making so nuch noise in
D political circles is only a scheme of
- its traitorous leaders to draw our
attention from the issue at stake.
e We again repeat the charge, and
for proof call attention to the ut
, terances of Mr. Sibley, the leader
of the movement, who, in an inter
view with the Chicago Age Report
er, sand:
5 If the Repubhlicans will nomi
nate Mr. Cameron, Mr. Teller or
t any other free coinage man on a
1 free coinage platform, we will ac
cept him and give him the benefit
a of all our work in the campaign.
1 If the Democrats nominate a free
coinage man on a free coinage plat
- form we will support him.
In oter words, the American
bimetallic party proposes to catch
t the disaffected in both the old par
ties, as well as the thoughtless
ones in the Populists ranks, and
turn them over to whichever of the
I old parties that will put free silver
in their platform in 1896.
It will be an easy task to put it
in either platform. The trouble
has always been, and will continue
to be, to hold them to their plat
form promises. With Democrats
and Republicans platforms are
made only to get in on; after that
they are absolutely useless.-Mer

Two new silver parties have at
ptempted to bring themselves into
existence, and the large, bushy
Republican tail of the North-west
has been strenuously striving to
wag the Republican dog of- the
East. All their efforts will end in
dismal failure. Their is but one
silver party in existenoe, and that
is the People's party. It has thou
sands of newspapers, nearly two
million voters, and as many able
orators. Had it not been or this
brave bdand ad the gaps they have
madem th" Imnes of the enemy,
these sameso-called silverites would
to-day have been sitting at the feet
of John Shberman and drinking in
the words of honeyed dew that fell
from the lips of that Republican
financial Christ.
The Popuhlists bore the sneers
and lings and insults of a hostof
degenerate sycophants until a ean
bueint number of people had be
comesaroused to erd r the ox- t
isteee of the two o parties.

at If iu, shoemaker. , by Ihand

I. inº his own temployer, then each re
ceives for his lalbor three pairs of
shoes. 'fThat i. ju',t wages. If
machinery bte added, ,omntingm t he
ts machine makers as shoe nmakers,
1 and4 31,4, Itirs be the product, then
Seach worker should receivwe 30 pairs
of shoes for his week's share or
e wage. Should the demand for
t- shoes he only the same as Ibfore
e the machines were used, then the
shoenmakers would work only one
u hour per day to supply the mar
ket and would receive just as much
for that one hour as they had for
rmerly received for ten hours, be
w cause they had supplied the same
e. goods to the users of shoes. This
would be exactly, the result of la
bor-saving machinery if the labor
° ers owned eqwally the machinery.
This would be the see of ma
A chinery. This equal ownership of
"e machinery can only be had in just
is one way: The people as a whole
shall own all machinery as a whole,
so that no man or set of men can
Smonopolize it or any part of it.
it To-day the ownership is private,
n the men own neither tools nor ma
d terial on which to work, and the
men who employ them have the
workers at their mercy. When
)- they make 3000 pairs of shoes they
get no more than when they made
o 300 pairs, and if the demand be
not increased the employer dis
charges the surplus labor and
works those retained ten hours,
Spaying only one hour's wage for
it. This is the abuse of machinery.
To-day, machinery enables men
on an average to produce ten times
as much wealth for the full day's
labor as they could do one hundred
e years ago before machinery was so
generally employed. Therefore it
follows they ought to be as able to
maintain their families as well on
one hour's labor daily as their fore
fathers did on ten hours, or one
t family to-day ought to be able to
1 keep ten families in the comforts
of a century ago. A heaven on
f earth can be realized whenever the
r laborer's vote the ownership of
land and machinery into their own
1 hands. When they are wise enough 4
- to do it, they will be wise enough
r to handle it.--Coiing Nation.
How It Is Arrived At.
Ever since gold and silver have
r been used as money the ratio has
been ascertained by taking all the
gold and silver in the world avail
t able for money and coin the same
number of dollars out of each]
metal. For instance, if there is
one ton of Fold and ten tons of sil
ver, the ratio would be 10 to 1; if
one ton of gold and sixteen tons 1
of silver, then 16 to 1; if one ton
of gold and twenty tons of silver,
20 to 1. This is what is meant by
the coinage ratio-"that propor
tion by weight which iill give the 1
exact same number 4 fall l
tender coins from etch ."
The statistics show that if all the
gold and silver available for money
were coined, the present coinage
ratio would be about 16 to 1. If
the production of gold were to
cease altogether, aml the present
production of silver continue, even
then it would require many years
for the coinage ratio to reach 17 to a
1, the annua production beingso
small as oompared with the qusati- 1
ty in us. When the ratio has
beeen ascertained by this rule, es
tablished by the ancients and fol- 3
lowed by mankind down to 1873,
then oen the mints to the free and
unlumited coinage of both metals,
and gold and silver will at once be i
on an equality in exchange value
in property and labor. The 100
cent gold dollar and the 50 cent
silver dollar then would be relegs
ted to oblivion; every dollar, a 100
cent dollar in exchange value. The -
idea of intrinsic value of money is
a recent creation of the gold bu
to confuse honest minds. Intrin- C
sic value in money has no existence
in truth, it exists only in the im
agination of some bemnighted gold
moaometallist; the leaders of the
gold sentiment know better but it
answers this purpose.--Wetsel d
