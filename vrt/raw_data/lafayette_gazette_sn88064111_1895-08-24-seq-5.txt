A country newspaper publisher
sizes up the "span of life," as fol
lows:
"A child is born, the doctor in'
attendance gets a Sto fee; the edi
tor notes it and gets o; it is chisten
ed and the minister gets $5, and the
editor writes it up and gets oo; it
marries and the minister gets
another $xo; the editor gets a piece
of cake or ooo.
"In the course of time it dies;
the doctor gets from $5 to Stoo and
the minister perhaps gets from $5 to
$5o, the undertaker $25 to $50; the
editor prints a notice of death and
an obituary two columns long, and
a set of resolutions of some lodge
or organization to which the de

Mr. C. G. Strong, principal of the
public schools at Anderson, Cal.,
says: "I have used Chamberlain's

Lameness usually results from a
sprain, or other injury, or from
rheumatism, for which Chamber
lain's Pain Balm is especially intend
ed and unequalled. It affords al
most immediate relief and in a short
time effects a permanent cure.

A Stingy Irnnler.lC

In the Lead.
In the way of hotel accommoda
tion Lafayette is ahead of any
country town in Louisiana. At
least this is the unanimous opinion
or the drummers, and they ought to
know. While all attest the merits
of the Crescent Hotel particularly
under the present management, the
Rigues House continues to enjoy
that reputation for which it is de
servedly famed far and wide. Es
pecially among the commercial
travelers may be heard praises of
this popular hotel, which has done
a considerable amount of good to
our town, for what will more favor
ably impress a stranger with a town
than a good hotel. A new-comer
will very likely form an opinion of
a country from the treatment he re
ceives at its hotels and this being
undoubtedly a fact one can readily
understand to what extent Lafa
yette owes its present prosperity to
its well-conducted hotels. A well
known New Orleans politician once
said to a representative of The Ga
zette that he doubted very much
the ability of any restaurant in the
Crescent city to give a better meal
than the Rigues House.

Some months ago the American
people looked upon the Hon. Jacob
Sechler Coxey as a monumental
crank and considered his scheme
for good roads and non-interest
bearing bonds as a huge joke, but
recent developments have proven
that the famous general of the com
monweal army is more of a shrewd
fellow than a fool. He is publish
ing quite a creditable gaper in the
advocacy of his cause to which
converts are being made in large
numbers. He has been placed at
the head of the Populis: ticket of
the State of Ohio and his ideas of
good roads and bonds are embodied
in the platform of that party, in
whose ranks are men of ability.
That Coxey has been unanimously
nominated for governor by the
People's Party shows that he is not
the fool he was represented to be
when forced to keep "off the
grass" at Washington. Who knows
that Coxey will not succeed McKin
ley as chief executive of the Buck
eye State, and subsequently elevated
to the presidency, in which event
our friend and neighbor Vander
Cruyssen will be tendered a cabi
net portfolio as a conpensation for
having composed that splendid
march which helped to soothe
the drooping spirits of the great
commonwealer when he was be
bind the bars and to instill new
hopes into the hearts of his fol
lowers. Whether our neighbor gets
the cabinet position or not, he is
about to conclude arrangements
with Mr. Coxey for several thous
and copies of the march.

It is rumored that cotton cater
pillars have made their appearance
at different points in the vicinity
hereabouts; it remains to be seen
whether it is really the worm that
does so much harm to the cotton,
or if like last season, it is merely an
insect that resembles the cotton
caterpillar very much, but does no
great damage. Our farmers should
at any rate, be prepared to give
them a warm reception.

in his power to keep the public
highways in good order, and he
succeeds very well. There is no
doubt that many of the other over
seers neglect their duty, and should
be removed; a result that could be
accomplished, by making the ne

cured in that quarter, let the com

The Fitness of the Thing.
Some Christian people are very much
exercised over the location of a saloon who
do not give themselves any anxiety w.- ,-r its
existence. If one is to be opened next to
them or their :L.urch, they are ready to cir
culate a petition and go before the Board
with a strong plea against it. But if it is on
another street and next door to another
church than theirs, they are willing to go to
the polls and vote for its continuance. Some
of our, religious weeklies have been inter
changing views on the advantages of the
placing of saloons near churches. One says:
The liquor saloon elsewhere will be just as
bad as if placed at the door of the church.
Why not fight the whole system, and de
mand that the saloons which are places of
death and destruction, be driven out of ex
istence? We are too willing that saloons shall
live and thrive, if they do not come near our
homes and churches, no matter who else is
injured." The New York Observer adds,
'"We are not sure that saloons are at all more
out of place near churches than they are
elsewhere. Nature often puts the antidote
near the poison. Church-going people need
to be impressed with the universality of the
saloons, for some of them are altogether too
willing to let the saloons have its way, . pro
vided it does not approch too near to the
churches and the children." To which an
other adds: "All this is true and to the
point. For ourselves we have never been
able to understand the logic or see the con
sistency of men who wax furious when a
saloon-keeper proposes to set up his den in
their blockor next door to their church, but
who are quite calm and easy when it comes
to voting saloons upon their fellow-men
down in the slums-the very people who
suffer most from the presence of grog shops,
and are least able to withstand their temp
tations."
The Law of Habit.
Frances E. Willard.
That which has been done once is easier
done the second time. Repetition is the
only basis of perfection. Patient continu
ance in well-doing conducts by a straight
path to glory, honor, and immortality.
Since 1874 I have been a steady student
of the law of habit-I had wellnigh said the
law of fate. I have seen it slowly, gently,
imperctptibly, wrap men round and round
in its close winding sheet, as if thay were
Egyptian mummies. So guilty was all this
done that they never knew their bondage
until the first faint movement toward a
better life, when, behold' their helplessness
recalled the Indian-tortured hunter perpen
dicularly planted in the ground with earth
packed around him even to the lips. A
miracle of faith has rescued some of these;
but a study of years compels the admission
that not more than five in one hundred inc
briates, gamblers or libertines are ever per
manently reformed. The thoughtless boy,
cigar in mouth, playing cards "just for
fun," and a little later with a glass of beer
as the stake, hiding all these things from hi.
mother, saying to himself, I'll quit this af
ter a while, but I want to sow my wild
oats"; the idle, spendthrift youth with fond
ness only for the vile company where hiz
worst passions can be gratified; the besotted
man, sold under sin, accursed of God and
his own conscience and his fell.ownen
these are the piteous object lessons that have
taught me the supreme power of habit over
human destiny. But I saw that the ten
dency to repeat the same act, and the
greater ease with which this is done the sec
ond time than the first, and the third time
than the second, is the key to paradise as
well as pandemonium. I saw the slow, un
erring, unfailing plan of God, by which our
habits may become our stepladder to saint
ship. And I said to my own heart in the
presence of many a bloated inebriate, what
I now whisper to you: "No evil habit, how
ever small, shall have dominion over me."
