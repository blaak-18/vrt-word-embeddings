CHA IVES J. BOATNER.
The States in referring to the death
of Hon. C. J. Boatner, which occurred
in New Orleans, where he had resided
several years and was engaged in the
practice of law, says:
"After. retiring from political life Mr.
Boatner, who was well trained in the
law, established l.imself in New Orleans
in the practice of his profession, and
here he made his mark as one of the
strongest advocates at the civil bar. He
represented not only many large and
important interests, but by his energy
and ability built up a large and lucra
tive individual proctice.
"The States is quite sure that the peo
ple not only of New Orleans but the
whole of Louisiana will deplore the
death of such a food citizen and kindly
Christian gentleman.
SENATOR MORGAN'S FIGHT.
Senator Morgan's fight on the Pan
ama canal was the remarkable fight of a
remarkable man. He had reasons for
every position he took, and he gave
them honestly and courageously. He
probably knows more about the ques
tion of an isthmian canal than any other
man alive, and whether right or wrong
in his opposition to the treaty which has
just been ratified, he is universally re
spected, both in the Senate and in the
country. The canal, as at last decided on,
is to be dug over a route which he
would not have chosen and on terms
which he did not like, but, after all.
when finished it will be a monument,
more to him than to any other one man,
with the possible exception of Lesseps.
-New Orleans States.
And yet some newspapers claiming
some influence have attempted to belit
tle Senator Morgan because he did not
join the majority in favor of the...Pan- 1
ma route. It may be said that any mon
key or flunkey may follow the crowd
and make grimaces at the man who
would not sacrifice principle for expedi
ency, honor for, glittering consideration.
As the States has well said: "The canal
when finished will be a monument more I
to him than to any other one man, with
the possible exception of Lesseps."
SENTIMENTAL GUSH.
The reunion of Confederate Veterans,
in New Orleans in May next gives op
portunity for what may be termed "sen
timental gush." The "old warriors" are
peculiar, unique in their personality,
and are the exceptions of all exceptions.
Without frills or furbelows, they repre
sent principles which are imperishable,
and they need no adulations or mean
ingless praise to hold their fame secure
in the world's historical record. Now
and then some "gusher" indulges in
words like these:
"It is fitting, indeeed, that the young
er generation should make the declining
years of these brave and true men
happy."
And to which shbuld be added:' "Pro
vided he is not seeking a political soft
job." In such event, he must struggle
desperately to keep up snd maintain
himself. But in the great scramble Qf
life he still maintains his own simply
because he is peculiar and stands as the
exception of *all exceptions. The "old
warriors" appreciate the difference be
tween sentimental gush and the praise
which is substantial.
IT IS IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE.
Ttie parties favoring the abolition of
State patronage and the adoption of pri
maries should get together in some man
ner and decide upon a definite line of
action. Efforts should be uniform and
systematic. The advocates of these I
measures are sufficiently numerous and
strong to demand and obtain conces
sions, and possibly to hold' the balance
of power in the next State convention,
and some organized effort looking in
that direction should be made.-The

The great majority of Democrats who
vote in Lquisiana ate ready to assert
themselves in favor of the rule` of the
people. But who will lead? It would
seem as if principles were to be sacri

ily in favor of the suggestion of The
Felicianas. With a leader success would
be assured beyond all the schemes of
the schemers. The issue today is iiot of

WITH. THE WRITERS.
Two Anecdotes of Booth Tarking
ton-The Real Little Dorrit.
[Special C'rrespondence.J
Chicago. March 24. - When Booth
Tarkington. the novelist and legislator 1
of Indiana, was first turned loose from I
college, he at once began what he de
scribes as "fussin' with literachoor." 1
He helped to launch and keep afloat
for a few months an obscure magazine
of the freaky, amateur sort.
This magazine was called John-a
Dreams and went so far as to construct 1
out of whole cloth a "lady writer," to- I
gether with excerpts from her works,
and to servo up to its small public "'an
appreciation" of the same.
Tarkington held the purely honorary
position of staff artist to this publica
tion, and because he disclaimed all
ability to drew he was allowed to sign
his sketches with his real name. He- I
cause he made some pretensions to an 1
ability to write he was compelled to
sign all his literary contributions with
the nom de plume Cecil Woodford.
This, of Bourse, was very effective in
keeping Tarkington out of the public
eye and away from public prints-a
service for which he now occasionally
longs as he reads in the daily papers
things he never said and accounts of E
things he never did. Such is the story j
of his intention to leave social life and 1
settle down on a farm; likewise the t
story of the doughnut factory-though
what he is reported to have said about -
it has almost the ring of the true Tark
ington humor.
A friend one day was lounging on
some available space not covered by
various pieces of Tarkington's tem
porarily castoff clothes. Tarkington
was keeping up a somewhat jerky con
versation. Suddenly he dived into a
bureau drawer and fishedI up a good
sized roll of manila legal cap.
"That's the start of a new story," he
said, looking at it and handling it for
half a minute as if he didn't know
wLat to do with it. "I think it's going
to be better than anything I have yet
done. - I've got it pretty well roughed
out here. I'm carrying it around in my
gripsack, and if I were to lose It I
couldn't reproduce it." r
This was the first manuscript of "The
Two Vanrevels." It had not occurred
to Tarkington to have it typewritten t
and leave one copy in a safe some
where. f

The current revival of interest in
Charles Dickens, his works, his haunts
and in the originals of his most cele
brated characters has resulted in throw
ing the glare of publicity upon an old
lady at Southgate. England, who has
just passed her ninetieth birthday and
tells how she came to be the original
of'Little Dorrit.
She Is Mrs. Mary Ann Cooper. Her
father, a well to do farmer, had a place
at Sunbury, where Dickens in his ear
ly youth was a frequent visitor.
"My Charles" Mrs. Codper has al
ways called the novelist. Between Mn

-ry Ann and Charles the closest friend
ship-almost ripening into something
mere-sprang up, and the old lady is
never tired 'f telling their adventures
and misadventures in the heyday of 1
youth. 1
Dickens had a habit of giving nick- E
names to his friends and relatives, as ,
he had a way of giving literary names s
to his sons. His name for Miss Mitton I
was Little Dorrit. I
"Why did be give you this name?" E
she was adked on her ninetieth birth
day. "How did you come to get into I
the Marshalsea and be famous ever I
afterward?"
"Well, I cannot esactly say," she an- E
swered: "but, as I have told you, i
Charles and I were, I think I may say, 4
very fond of each other. and one day i
at home he told us, 'The next book I i
write I shall put you in it, and I shall 1
call it "Little Dorrit." ' Thus his next I
work was named." 1
Mrs. Cooper, however, never was in E
the Marshalsea debtors' prison.

GOWNS FOR MOURNING.
Many of Them Beautiful Creations.
Widows May Wear Hats.
We all know that everything, wheth
er good or bad, has its compensation.
and therefore we are prepared'to find
a sort of subdued comfort in elegant
ly cut and fashioned garments, even
though they are designed to express
sorrow and mourning for the dead.
One might even say that the fashion
able mourning gowns are made more
carefully and beautifully than those
for ordinary occasions. The skirts are
made to conform with the most stylish
of the modes of the day. Ilaireloth
and featherbone give them the fash
ionable flare at the base and cause
them to fall in rich folds at the bot
tom. The materials used vary to a
great extent, according to the age of
the wearer and the degree of relation
ship. The silk warp endora still re
mains the one thing for elegant first
mourning, but after that come soft tex
tures of silk and wool mingled or of
silk alone in some clever crape weave.
Fine dull cashmere and a crape cloth
made of mohair and Australian wool.
woven in form of heavy crape, are also
shown.
There is a kind of armure cloth
which makes up into very pretty
mourning gowns when developed with
all the care used in making other hand
some garments. One dress of this kind
is shown at one of the stores. The
skirt, which is just allowed to touch
I the floor in the back. has a twelve inch
shaped flounce around the bottom.
This is a little deeper at the back and
is stiffened in the approved fashion
with a black taffeta rutfle beneath as
a protector. On the flounce is one
band of English crape four inches deep
and above that three rolls of the same
crape, as small as they can be made.
The skirt is cut in many gores, every
one of them piped down with the crape.
Where the flounce joins the skirt there
is a flat band one inch wide. There is
a short half fitting; coat to wear with
this of the same material. The revers,
cuffs and pocket lids are of the crape.
There is a vest of dull armure silk, and
this is buttoned to the c-iu with crape
covered buttons. The outside coat,
which is fastened to the vest, is so
made that the flat collar and revers
render some such arrangement neces
sary. Like the poor, the high collars
are always with us. The mode of fas
tening the outside coat to the vest ob
tains in many of the new spring suits.
Even widows are now allowed by
fashion to wear hats instead of uncom
fortable little bonnets. It is not on
common to see a laly with a large
flat hat made, it is true, of crape, but I
tucked and puffed and ruched into
something like grace and beauty.
There are many vest effects in mourn
ing attire. Perhaps the wish to have
something a little less somber has some
thing to do with it. It is. and always
was a pretty fashion. Blouse bodices
are often seen. Under those circum
stances the waist is made ornamental
with tucks and folds qf grape andesome
times with a little dull chenille em
broidery. A home gown for a young
widow is made of voile. set over a
taffeta slip. Around the shaped flounce
are narrow rolled bands of crape, two
at the bottom and two at the top.
Around the hips the skirt is trimmed
ELEGANT MSOURIuING.
with Very narrow pipings, and the
blouse waist has revers of heavy Eng
lish crape and a shirred vest of the
same. The collar is a band of the voile.
with a turndown collar of crape. -The
collars may be of white tucked lisse or
fine mull, all white or with black
stitching. This is a matter of individ
nal taste.
In matters of mourning costume more
latitude is now allowed than some years
ago. A woman In really deep mourning
may now ,go to informal dinners and
assist at semigrand functions at home
after the first three months. For such
occasions is the pretty fancy of a waist
shown here. The skirt is of some reg
ulation mourning goods, such as ar
mure silk or eudora cloth, but the waist
is made of black chiffon . shirred in
lengthwise rows and garnished with
exceedingly narrow folds of crape in
clusters of three. Around the semide
collete neck is a ruff of accordion plait
ed silk mull edged with a narrow ruche
of chiffon. Just above that is an ar
rangement of folds of crape edged with
dull jet beads. Jet ornaments in form
of light neck laces are very much liked.
The older the style is the better is it
liked.
Gloves for mourning are of suede or
glace kid. One's handkerchief may be
entirely-white or embroidered black or
with a hem of black. Full gowns of
chiffon and brussels net made over silk
are the proper thing when the wearer
wishes to go to some dinner or recep
tion permitted by the ordinary conven
tiona-lites. Some gows are made aim
sple, but 1€er air trimmedwith

A Resident of New York Has Just
Celebrated That Birthday.
PROIJD OF LONGEVITY
Mir. Price Ascribes His Long Sojourn
Upon This Terrestrial Sphere to
Eating His Food Slowly
and Thorough Chewing.
New York, March 27.-Born in 1802,
In this city, Isaac B. Price has just
celebrated his 101st birthday. During
life Mr. Price has only once been out
side the city limits. He has never
been outside the state; he has never
ridden on a trolley car, and although
he has crossed East river many times.
he has never been over Brooklyn
bridge. He takes great pride in his
long life. "I think it due," he isaid,
"to the fact that I thoroughly masti
cate my food and I never used liquor
or smoked. I chewed tobacco, how
ever, since I was a boy. I have al
ways taken a full hour to each meal,
sometimes more. If people nowadays
would only take time to masticate
their food properly there would not be
so much trouble from indigestion and
dyspepsia and they would live longer."
Mr. Price cast his first vote in 1825
for John Quincy Adams for president,
and has voted in every presidential
election since.

Arlington levee, below Baton Rouge,
which was said to be in trouble, is re
ported by the levee commissioners to
be firm and almost certain to live
through the flood.
Local feeling of confidence is In
cileased by the announcement of the
crest passing Helena, and expectations
are that with good weather the levees
can carry off the water that Is to come
from that point.
The Atchafalaya continues to carry
off a large volume of water from the
Red andi Mississippi, and this natural
ly has decreased toe quantity of water
south of the Red.

General Sir Hector MacDona 1, who
committed suicide at the lotel jegina
here Wednesday, was removed to gie
British mortuary chapel, where it will
await shipment to its final restag
place in Scotlan4.
The French law requires that bodies
of suicides be taken to the nmrgue.
but owing 0> the urgent desire of the
British officials that the body of the
distinguished officer be not deposited
in a public morgue, the usual lecal re
quirements were waived.
It was said at the British embassy
that no orders have been receivedu
from London concerning the disposi
tion of the body and it is expected
that the family of the deceased gen
eral will make final arrangements.
Both the officials of the British em
bassy and the consulate general of
Great Britain disclaim any knowledge
of the existence of letters which were
reported to have been found in the
room where the general killed himself.
Mr. Ingliss, the British consul gen
eral, said: "I have been personally as
sured by the commissary of police that
no such letters have been found."
There is evidently a desire on the
part of the officials to shield the mem
ory of the general out of sympathy
for his family.
