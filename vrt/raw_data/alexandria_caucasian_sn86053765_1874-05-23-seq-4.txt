The couple got home late in the ev
ening, and going around back of
theliouso, ho as not to disturb the
folks, they sat down on t he sloop
to think. During the process she
leaned her head, in its new spring
hat, against the house, andJiecame
absorbed in t he stars and othPr im
provements, while he tenderly eyed
bis boots. About a half hour was
spent in this profitable occupation,
when the young man felt something
tiicklo down his neck. "Don't
weep, Julia," be softly murmered.
"Pain't," said she, surprised. J le
looked up and bis eyes rested on an
oozy substance back of lier head.
"What's that on the back of your
hat V' he cried. She jumped up at
t hat interrogation, and instinctively
placing her hand on the back of her
head,»drew it away "again lull ot an
unpleasant ly flavored slime. With
h shriek of rage and passion the in
furiated gill tore the mackerel from
the nail, and trampled it beneath
her leet, while she snatched oil her
bat and tore it in shreds with her
livid lingers. The horror-stricken
young mau not knowing what el so
to dojumped the first fenconiid «iis
appeared, and hasn't been seen
siuco by the untotunate gill.

DECISION OF THE POPE.
THE HT. LOUIS GLOBE of the 10th
ult., make» tho followiug impor
tant announcement:
Roman Catholic farmer« deelrou» of
joining-the order of tho patrons of
husbandry, have hitherto had in their
way tli« law» of their church, forbid
ding it« member» to identify them
Helves witb secret societies. Of our
American prelates we believe that
yyrchhuthop Alemanry, of San Frau
cisch, ha» held that tho Catholic far
mer will do well to ere on the aide of
safety, anil so not join the grauge un
til the, Pupe has evpre»»cd Iii» approv
al of It» objects, while other Itishops
have forbidden member»of their Hock»
from becoming patron» upon any con
sideration
The matter litis been finally ndju.li
cated on by Pious IX, lis appear» by
the Norisk Volkebl.nl, die .Scandiumi
an organ ot Minnesota.
A Catholic member of the State Leg
islature was desirous of joining the
grange, but had conscientious »ciuple«
about doing so, arising from hi» reli
gioii» belief.
He consulted Father Ireland, of St.
Paul, who referred Iii m to Itinhop
fJracc. lloth these clergymen e*
pressed themselves as possessing a fa
vorable impression of the principles,
object« and methods ot the grange, lint
neither of them could break though tho
absolute rule of the church, and they
reçoit, mended the legislator to appeal
to Rome.
He accordingly laid the matter l»e
foro the Pope, to whom he transmitted
at the same time lull particulars as to
the objecta contemplated by the oraler,
and the mean» by which it was pro
positi to attain them.
A reply l as been received from Iiis
Holiness, stating that the Pope allows
the petition to join the Grange of
I'atioiis of Husbandry, and he a mem
her thereof, if ho tiliii nothing there ii.
conflict with hi» conscience, or tho
creed of the Catholic Church.
As a congrégation, the order lin»
received a large accession in Minneso
ta, and When the news of the Pope's
decision has reached other States, it»
effects will be largely to increase tho
numbers of the patrons, and to remove
the interdict laid upon Catholics dé
sirions of becoming »itch, b.v prelate»,
who have disapproved of the Grange,
and been doubtful as the consistency
of its obligations with those of tho
Chut ch.
