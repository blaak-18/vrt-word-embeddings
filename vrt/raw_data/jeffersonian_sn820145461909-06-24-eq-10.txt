Run A long Now Opie Read
The evening was bitter cold. Two
children —a boy with a manly face
and an expression of matured con
cern, as though some one had ever
been dependent on him, and a pale
faced little girl—wandered about the
streets of a Western city. They had
been left by an immigrant train, hav
ing fallen asleep in the barn-like
waiting-room, and, owing to the hurry
incident upon the departure, no one
thought of them. They begged the
station-keeper to allow them to re
main by the fire, but he discredited
their story—declared that they had
not been left by a train; that they
had been in the city, and were “hang
ing around” to steal something. Ev
erybody hurried along. No one had
a kind look for the waifs. They went
into the warm corrider of a hotel, but
a man said:
“Run along, now. You don’t want
to be stopping here.”
“We are nearly frozen,” the boy
replied, “and we want to get warm.”
“Children ought to be at home
such weather as this. Your mother
ought to know better than to send
you out.”
“Our mother is dead, sir. She died
two weeks ago, and we came away
with people who are going south
where it’s warm, but the train left
us, and the man won’t let us stay in
the depot.”
“Very good story, young fellow;
but run along home. Parents that
would send their children out to beg
such weather as this should be pun
ished.”
“We are not begging.”
“Run along with you.” And he
opened the door, and they passed out
into the cutting wind. The fierce
blast seemed to blow the darkness
close up to the lamps; the tired
teams seemed to blow chilling mists
from their nostrils; and the heavy
wagon-wheels seemed to sink deep
into the darkness and pulverize
gloom. The children went into a
drug-store.
“Run along there.”
They went into a restaurant.
“Run along there.”
They went into a saloon, where
merry revelers sang wild songs, and
where the maudlin man dropped a
tear into his glass.
“Run along there,” said the bar
tender. “This is no place for chil
dren.”
“Let us warm ourselves,” implor
ed the boy, and he repeated his
story.
“That’s all very well, young
man, but haven’t I seen you around
the streets begging many a time?”
“No sir.”
“I think I have, I’ll bet you
haven’t taken less than ten dollars
home today. Run along.”
Again they were in the freezing
gloom.
“Oh, where will we wake in the
morning?” came from the saloon
and died on the air as the boy and
his sister turned a corner.
“Don’t cry, little pet.”
“I’m so cold.”
“Yes, but we may find some place.
Let us go back to the depot, and
maybe we can get on a train.”
They wandered around in the
blinding sleet.
Jeffersonian
“We are a long time getting
there,” said the girl.
“I believe we are lost,” the broth
er replied. “Let us turn in here.”
And they went into a narrow alley
and crouched down by a wall.
Ah, Mr. Humanity, because you
have sometimes shown pity and af
terward found that it was ill-be
stowed, you have hardened your
heart.
Ah, Mr. Churchman, whose knees
press the soft velvet at the time of
prayer; you who see suffering with
dry eyes and read with moisture the
"simple annals of the poor,” scratch
from your Bibles the heart-warm
ing sentence, “Suffer little children
to come unto me,” —scratch it out,
or you are a hypocrite.
“If I could smell the blossoms by
the porch, I wouldn’t be so cold,”
said the little girl.
“It will be a long time before they
bloom again, little pet.”
“Will this cold weather kill the
tree?”
“No, but it will be a long time be
fore the summer comes.”
“Can people in heaven look down
and see the people on earth?”
“Yes, I think so.”
“I wish they couldn’t.”
“Why, pet?”
“Because if mamma looks down
and sees us she wouldn’t be happy
any more.”
He drew her closer to him. The
neighbor’s lights went out one by
one. The sleet seemed to be con
quering everything. The dog that
had barked over on the hill was si
lent. A cheerless, freezing morning
broke in. In an alley sat two rigid
forms. The boy was in his shirt
sleeves. He had put his tattered
jacket around his little sister, and
both were dead.
MR. YOXALL AND HIS HECKLERS.
Hecklers do not stand much chance
of scoring off J. H. Yoxall, M. P.
“Now then, sir, how many quarts of
milk ought you to get out of a good
cow?” was one of the questions put
to him when he first sought to enter
parliament. The candidate had not
the faintest idea of the quantity, and
sought refuge in wit: “It depends
on the distance from the nearest
pump,” he answered, and the audi
ence laughed and applauded. An
other night, when the question was,
“What’s the difference between a
mangel-wurzel and a turnip?” Mr.
Yoxall made reply, “I always know
a turnip by its resemblance to the
shape of the questioner’s head.”—
