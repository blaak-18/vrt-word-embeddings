Wiarmotl, the W',arrior.
at
The most important thini we giath- t
er froml our W\ashingtoln dispatches,
and from the city press, is the prop- til
able return of Wartnith to the lead
irship of the stal\art republicans of t
Louisianan. s
A combination of circunistancc' ,
brought about, in a great measure .by
those whom the peophle of the State at
fondly hoIr:d wouhdl rp,ni.h felons fi s
]past ntIsdeeds., would seem, to the
timid observer, to render the chamnes .i
of this man successful. The crowd"l ti
that Warmoth once le:ad to the feast
of spoils are still here-free as air,
andl some of them, notably Pinchblack, ci
grace the reftril adtministration as p
an evidence of grand (?) conservatism.
These people are scattered through- n
out the State, positively stronger to- a
day than they were six miontlhs ago t
and their objective point, the pln- t:
der of the white properlty owner, is
one so remunerative as to call fhrth
the energies and hiain of the whole
mass. Besides this, they have now n
no fear of consequences. No timid- e
ity of action, in consequence of a
dread of the rigors of stern law, will
now deter them from doing their Y
worst. For have they not an ev.
idence that those in power now inti
Louisiana have a policy of "brtotlheily t
love" to accomplish, and are slowly 1
hat surely educating the people to a ti
firm belief in the utter depravity of ti
the human famiily, at least, so far as
that part of the family which resides t,
in Louisiana is concerned. Nay, they a
musteven be convinced, as we are,
that loyalty to virtue and honesty b
meets no reward in Louisiana ; for
have they not an evidence of this fact c
from the appointments to office, tn- t
der a government they hanl reason to
fear for their evil and illegal deeds, r
of their most vicious characters, some C
of them in the rural districts of those a
very men whom an outraged and rob- n
bed people in 1874 forced to resign. j
Th9 field seems, for these reasons, t
to be very encouraging to Warmoth, t
but lie has still something to fear- e
and that is the stern, inflexible deter.
minhtion of the white people to meet t
his arguments in a way that will be
irresistable. Although Warmoth's t
crowd" have every reason to nltici- f
pate an easy success they will yet a
find that it is reckoning without a s
host. Our city friends need feel no e
alarm on account of the rual districts',
where Warmoth is said to have his t
backers.
The country parishes, so fir as our
observation goes, are safe and solid.
Every friend whom Warmoth could
depend upon, is too well known and
has no following ; and we can safely
assure the Democracy of New Orleans
that a campaign by the whites of Red
River valley against Warmoth's arimy
would be more fierce thIan that against
Kellogg in 1874.
When Warmotlth comes, he mnust
come with brand ad bow for hie will
le met at thle threshold of our fair
valley, for we recognize it as a con
test for home and firesides, with stout
hearts and williig armas and if he does
win, he will rule a desert, not a gar
den.
BUELL, the Washington Corres- k
pondent of the New Orleans Democrat, 0'
pleases to say that President Hayes w
appointed. Jack Whalton U. S. Mar- 11:
shal for Louisiana, upon the ground :1
of his being the Rhoderick Dhu of si
the swamps, and that the mere fact
of the announcement of Jack, "the re- p
doubtable warrior," being appointed
would scare the "shot gun b'hoys" b
out of their very boots. Jack's stand- a
ing as a good fellow is abont on a 0
par with that of his notoriou quali- ii
lications as a blackguard, and as for
the "warrior" part of the story, Jack ,
Wharton never aspired to that posi c
tion. \\'harton, as is known to every 0
officer jn Forrest's cavalry, was a ,
most infamonus coward on the field, t
and a veritable Falstaff in camp. s
Gen. Forrest, by order, sent him to I
the rear of his regiment for "cow
ardice on the field," where he remain
ed and marched, joked and bragged t
for more than a year. In fact, the
only fight in which "Marshal" Jack
commanded with "brilliancy and
bravery," was in Bossier parish in
1867, when he murdered a whole Ã½
plantation of 'niggers."
We fear Hayes will find "Jack" a I
poor Rhoderick with which to fright
en the "b'hoys" up Onachita or Red
River.

I5th. The exticise of the ballot is a
high pri'ilege not a huniinii right, and

The Lamb and Lion "usiness," to o
use the slang of the show people, of
was enacted to close perfection when
the Democratic members of Congress fur
joined with Warmouth and his co- ol
hurts in 1Washington, in recommnend- I,
ing Effingham L ,wrence to the post si,
of Collector of the Port of New Or. tro
leans, "Brutus" the home Correspond- lan
cut of the New Orleans .Denwerat, D
and a gentleman well known to the cai
S"patriots of Louisiana," presents it
in this way:
But the wonder of wonders to all who
t have had any real hand in the relenip St
tion (f poor Louisiana is, that our own wi
Democratic members of Congress, placed thi
in position through the agonizing throes
of deadly opposition to Warmoitlismn in li
all its phases, should have joined War- pry
moth in recommeuding Lawrence. God en
knows Lawrence alone, Lawrence sas
tained by his own business capacity, his an
own high purpose, his own patriotism,
R would have been bad indeed Yet we
have all these high qualities in Law
rence (?) but for which he has never been 0o
d distinguished among men, and Lawrence ta
f sustained by Warmoth ! And our Con- tlt
gressmen, too, have joined Waruloth in
reconmmending Lawrence for this high in
- position! ti
, Of course to the unsophisticated voter
,, who has gone through the eight years
battle against corruption and despotism. gi
1- and has learned-aye, taught the world
a over again-that only brute force can or
crush out brutality, this is one of the
i- insolvable enigmas. We place this act
,, beside the appointments of Pinchback,
Longstreet, Howe, et id oane genus, and
we ask ourselves, CiI bono? No answer th
conies; lbut the politician whispers in
our tired ear-c-o-n-s-e-r-v-a-t-i-s-ml! in
S Worcester says the word Conservative
a means "tending to preserve-preserva
d tive." And to preserre our property and
our civilization has been the fearful
P struggle of every decent white man in
to Louisiana for eight long and weary years.
Every peaceable meanr was exhausted in
vain; had only progressed to worse. At
n - last blood was spilled to preserve, and
ed the era of preservation dawned on as.
Reason and solicitation were mocked to
ie scorn; only force could prevail for good.
ek Who, then, have been the "Conserva
ad tives Y" Who have caused the starlight
of preservation of a cherished civiliza
tion once more to flicker through the
)le dark cloud of Radicalism I The Pinch
backs, Howes, Longstreets and Lawrenc
es f Ask the blood-stained stones that
a pave Canal street!
t- It will be remembered that the VIN
ed DICATOR has all along insisted on the
Democrats allowing the Radicals to
transect their own business without
ac- let or hindrance; however, they seem
8. bent on "putting their foot in it"
.85 every opportunity they get, and we
suppose it best to let the "fools learn
their own folly."
Judge King. the head and front of the
"Louisiana Conservative element," re
signs his position as collector of the port
of New Orleans, and thus passes away
the glory of the house of Anderson.

The Work in Congress.
Our branch of Congress. as the HIouse
of Represuetatives is popular:ly known
with the people, has, for the first time
inl years, begun that which Buckle tells
Its is the only good work legislators ever it
do, to repeal the had laws enacted by
the predecessors in office.
The silver hill and tde repeal of the
resumlnption Act are the topics of legisla
tiin which now engross attention, not t
only in the Iialls of Congress, but in
every village and hamlet in the land
The hill demonetiziig silver passed un- .
der the rnag law in the tlemnhlie'n ('on- 1
gress of 1:73, was one of the miost out
:raeoucs and flagrant violations of the :5
rights tof the masse's ever perpetratid t
and was so cliarly in the interests of the
ring of hoid holders, :is to have met in
every election since, the most stulbborn
alnd emphaitic denunciation of the pe- a
ple. This hill the l)emocratic louse..
true to constituents and pledges. have t
repealed by a vote of 168 to 34. It is
beforee lthe do Senate for their concur- t
rance, with every hope of their doing so.
In the mealltime, the m(oney power
conies to Waslhington fromt New York,
lston. and other Eastern cities to pro
test againt a ine:IIsire not one of then
canl say is not of vital benefit to the peo
p l1 at htrge. and this body of lohhyists t
are moving heaven and earth to defeat
the will of the masses. It seems that
President Hayes has not given them
that attention which they have hereto
Sfore commnaledl , and we have every
assurance of the final success of the
Illeasl' r.
The repeal of the Reisumption Act. is
e now udetr discussion, and will pass the
r house.
These t win measures, with a new aind
I vigorous tariff for R'renue only, will he
r of great benefit to the entire country,
and there consequences will le at one('
seen in a return of confidence, a renewal I
of industry and an invigoratinz of the
whole body politic not before felt since
before the war.
Let our Congressmen and party be
steadfast and true to these salient points
of party principle, and all will not only
- e well for the people, but llemiocratic
paI ty su!cce'ss will be assured.
Standing armies are standing menaces n
to popular liberty, and they are totally
inconsistent with republican ideas. It
makes no ditfference 'ihout the size of the'
army, it. is the principle of the th thing that
is incomupatable with our views of a Re
public. We remember that last year, a
single regiment quartered by Grant at go
the Capitol, overawedl tkle whole Ameri
can people, who were sutlicient in inunm
bers, it is trite, to have destroyed the
regilment. Ra
English liberty as now exercised and
boasted of, was secured long bef'lre the a,
(lays of her standing army. Had it been o(i
in existance when Hamlpdlen, Pymoln. and
Cromwell, made their successful ell'ort.
'"English liberty" would not be a thing of
pride as it is to-dtay. France gains and fr
then loses her liberties as she puts de wn
and Ililhs up her National (lnardl. When
these citizen soldiers are replaced by to
regulars a coup d'ctat follows certain, and
some one rides to power on the bayonets G
of the standing army, and upon the ruins
of the liberties of Frenchmen. le
America wants no standing army- she it
wants none at all. her State Militia is
far better, both as a principl', and as
soldiers. The "frontier protection !" why
Indian forays and Mexican raids are
tt simply augmented by United States of
troops who, on the frontiers, are the
1. laughing stock of both Indians, Mexicans,
t, Desperado's and the Rangers. An Indian
Scares no mnore for a regular soldier than y
it for a wooden man ; it's only the frontier
Ranger and Indian hunter that he dreads. t
0o Let the government pay the frontier
p States to protect their frontiers, and there
n will be no more Indian wars. Disband t
< the army and encourage a pride in State
SMilitia organizations, that will niot only
r- protect us from foreign foes, but from an
ed enemy more to be dreaded, the home
W ambitions tyrant.
