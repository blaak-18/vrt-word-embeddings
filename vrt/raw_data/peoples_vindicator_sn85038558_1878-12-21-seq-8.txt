THE FEVER AT NEW ORLEANS.
Whence it Came and What it Cost.
Reports of Drs. Chopin and Aus
tin, read before the American
Public Health Association.
[Richmond Dispatch.]
Dr. Chopin, president of the Board
of Health of New Orleans, read a
paper on tire yellow fever at New Or
leans, which, lie said, was this year
brought from Havana by the steam
ship Emily B. Souder, on May 23.
The history of the spread of the
disease was given ire detail, and the
sanitary condition of the city ably
described.
In summing up, the Doctor said ;
"The expecrience of the present
year with regard to the efficacy of a
strict quarantine goes to sustain the
theory of importation and portability
of yell w fever. Witness Galves
too, which has not developed a single
case. Witness Shreveport, Monroe,
La., and Natchez, Miss., with their
shot-gun quarantines turning away
pestilence; and witness, again, Mi
bile, which has certainly escaped rn
epidemic.
"From the statement and facts
given in the accompanying papers
[which be submitted to the associa
tion] it is an irresistible conclusion
that yellow yever is not an indige
nous disease of Louisiana or any
other part of the United States, bnut
that the many years whec it made its
appearance in this country it could be
traced, either directly or indirectly,
to a foreign source.
"We, in Louisi ir a operating under
a quarantine law not absolute in its
restrictions, after an earnest effort in
executing it, conducted with all the
honesty and energy at our command,
assisted by incorruptible quarantine
officials, have utterly failed in pre
venting the importation of the pesti
lence, which has thrtwo gloom ac:d
sorrow over our whole Southwestern
valley. No condlitional qunarantine
can ever be niade effective because-
first, of the laxity with which laws
are unfortunately executed in this
cor 'ry; nd csecondly, because of
'1 ipidity of commercial interests
wake, which will always move
lim-avon and earth to evade success
fully all quarantine laws and reguila
tionus.
"Thegreat object to be aimed at is
to prevent the germs or fonites of
this dreaded piestilence from having
access to our ICpeople, and thie only
certain and sure lprtventive of yelh.w
fever, in miy humble ophiiioin, is abso
lute non-intercourse with ports wiheme
yellow fever is indigenous fromn rthlie
slet of April to the 1st of Novemiber
of each year.
"Once eludicate this disease from
the land, as it must necessarily be by
our cold winters, and, gentlenen,
mark my word, w, well never again
be visited by r hI terrible scourge un
less introduced from abroad."
Dr. Choppin estimates the c:st of
the yellow fever in New Orleans in
1878 as follows:
Estimated number of cases. 25,000
Cost of ten days' sickness of
each one at $3.......... $750,000
Cost of 4500 funerals at $25
each.................... 112,500
About two-fifths of4500 vic
time represent each a capli
tal value of *1000, amotnt
log to................1,r800,000
Remaining three-fifths at
$.00-----..-...... ...... 810,000
Loss of time of half the in
dostrial. population-asy
28,000 people.-for ninety3
days, at $2 per day.. .... 3,600,000
Values destroyed by the epi
demic..-.....--......... 7,072,500
Commercial losses by inter
ruption of intercourse with
the surrounding country
and diversion of trade to
other cities.--.-......... 5,000,000
Total losses...........$12,072,500
Estimated profits of the
summer trade with ports
where yellow fever neu
ally prevails........$. $1,500,000
The difference between these two
sums-say $10,572,500 - represents
the actual cost of the epidemic to the
material resources of New Orleans.
These figures, made upon a basis
deemed modernte in all particulars,
show that a trade during half the year
with certain tropical ports, and worth
to our city a million and a half dol
Ihn, 1s held at a risk of more than
'" ylve millions-the actual losses
frs1m yellow fever. An estimate of
liiie total losses to our country fromm
this epidemic has been made by Mr.
A. B. Farquhar, in a letter to Sir
geon-General Woodwoitlh, in which
be places them at the enormous sum
of S1JT,000,000.
IrPJDsm IN NEW ORLEANS IN 1839.
Dr. W. G. Austin, member of the
Board of Health of New Orleans, fol
lowed Dr. Choppin, and read a valu
able paper. It was devoted in con
siderable part to the epidemic of 1839,
eomparlug it with that ofl878, which
it was much like, and which, he
thoaght, clearly proved was imported,
sad not of local origin. In thirty
fve years' experience in Louisiana
and Mississippi, he was satisfied there
has never been a stngle case origina
ted there. The fever is indigenous
to the climate of the West India
Islands, the coast of Mexico and
South America, within the tropices. It
is brought to us in ships in fomities.
Thei t spreuds notll: it reaches the
air of a cold climate, when the germs
hit and become harmless, for one of
two reasons: that the germ has lost
Its foree, or there is not an adapta
tion of the atsimosphere calculated to
absorb the poison. It is not ende-·
mic in any of the Southern Statee.
Dr. Austin proposes that 1878 shall
be last year of yellow fever in New.
Orean, "if we haill declares -onin
Woeuresbetween all the ports where
yellow fever is eonemic and New Or"
leasr from the frst day of May natil
the drat of November.
Both Dr. Choipjpin and Dr. Austin
spoke in handsome terms of the lib.
eraliy of the people of the country
t toa aellieted of New Orleans.
