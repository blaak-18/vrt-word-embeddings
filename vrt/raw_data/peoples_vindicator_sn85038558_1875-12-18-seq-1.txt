To bear it's life from earth,
To live where angels are.
Why should we mourn to part,
With one so ripe for heaven,
No stain upon the heart,
No sin to be forgiven.
Then cease the throes of grief,
And dry the falling tear,
Death's but a sweet relief,
From earthlife, sorrows here.

Her Corner in Tombstones.
The Widow Smyth called at Mr.
Mix's marble yard the other day,
when the following conversation took
place :
Mrs. Smyth-Mr. Mix, I am anx
ions to have my cemetery lot fixed up,
to put in new tombstones and re-set
the railing, and I called to see if I
could take semen satisfaetary. arrasgeo
ment with you.
Mix-Certainly, madam ; tell me
precidely what it is you want done.
Mrs. Smyth-"Well, I'd like to
have a new tombstone put over the
grave of John, my husband, you
know, and to have a nice inscription
cut on it-Here lies John Smith, etc.,
you know-the usual way, of course,
and may be some kind of a design on
the stone, like a broken rosebud, or
something.
Mix-I understand.
Mrs. 8Snyth-Well then, what'll
you charge me for getting up a head
stone, just like that, out of pretty
good, white marble, and with a little
picture of a torch upside down, or a
weeping angel on it, and thie name of
Tlhomas Smyth out on it ?
Mix-John Smyth, you mean ?
Mrs. Smuyth-No, I mean Thomas.
Mix-But you said John before.
Mrs. S-I know, but that was my
fitat husband and Thomas was my
second, and I want a new headstone
for each of them. Now it seem to me,
Mr. Mix, that .where a person is bury
ing more than one that way you ought
to make some reduction- in the price
-throwoff something, you know-
though of course I want a pretty
good article at all the graves. Noth
inggorgeous, but neat and tasteful;
something calculated to please the
eye. Mr. Smyth was not a man who
was found of show. Give him a
thing that is comfortable, and he
was satisfied. Now, which do you
think, is .the pretiest-to have the
name in raised letters in a straight
line over the top of the stone, or just
to cut the words ".Alexander P.
Smysth in a kind of a semi-circle in
supken lettets. -
Mix-Did I understand you to say
Alexander P. t Were,,you referring
to 'John, or Thomas t
Mrs 8:-Of course not. Alexander
was my third husband.' I'm not go
ipg to neglect his grave while I am
fixing up the rqst. I wish to make
a complete job of it, Mr. Mix, while
I am about it, and I am willing for.
youn to undertake the job if you are
;easquable in your. charges, Now,
what'll you charge me fur a lot, the
kind 1 have descried--plain but
substantial, and sunk about two feet,
I shouldtthink; at the head of each
grave-what'll you chaige me for
them-,-the whole four I.
Mix-*ell, I'lli pit you in those
thWe6 head-stones
Mrs. 5.--Four headstonies, Mr. 'Mix,
not three.
Mix-Four was it t. No --there was
,Joh , anm Thomas and , Alexandr P.;
tft is all 'you said. I thiunk. Only
three.
HMrs. 8.-Why, I. want one for
Adolph, too, as a matt;r of course-
the same as the others. I thought you
kuett I wanted ela toti Adolph. One
madeojbit like John'is, onily with the
name differentf Adolph ", was umy
fourth husband He died about, three
years after I buried Philip. I am
wearing moornlngfor;him now. Now
please give mtoe your prices for the
whole of them. i
UMix-Wil, madam, I wg to be
as reasonablea'. can. I'lil t~ll you
what P11 do. You give mee all of
your worknl. the futoure and PI'l put
youin thol efIUhmadatonea at hardly

Miz--I think yeou nientioned five.
Mrs. 8.-No ounly four.
Mix-Let us see. There way John
and Thomas, Aleck, Adolph and
Philip.
Mrs. S--Yes, but Aleck and Phil
ip were the same one His iniddle
name was Philip, and I always called
him Phil.
Mix-Mrs. Smyth, I'll be much oh.
iged to you if you'll tell me precisely
how many husbands yvo have plant
ed up in that cemetery lot. This is
getting a little mixed.
Mrs. S.-What do you man, sir,
by planted 7 I never planted any
body in my life. It is disgraceful to
use such language.
Mix-It is,a technical term, madam.
We always uee it. I don't see as it
going to hurt any old row of corpses
named Smyth. PlaQted is' goodii
enough for other men and is good
enough for them.
Mrs. S--Old row of-what did yon
say ? what do you mean. you imupu
dent vagabond t I wouldn't let you
put a headstone on one of nmy graves
if you'd do it for nothing.
' Then Mrs. Smyth flounced out of
the shop, and Mix called after her as
she went through the door :
"Lemme know when you go for an
other man, and.I throw him a tomb
stone for a wedding present; lie will
want it soon."
Mrs. Smyth is 'now looking at head
stounes in a marble yard on Washing
ton street.
Young Keitzle's Awakening,
"My son," said old Keitzel. appear
ing at the head of the stairs with a
suspicious looking strap in his hand,
"it is now the rosy time of morn, and
Aurora shines high in the heavens,
warming the heart of the lark as he
soars aloft filling the air with his
melodies. Awake, my son, and
breathe thou the freshness of a new
born day !"
"Let the world heave on its ocean
noise, I ask but sleep," said Tom as
he pulled the blankets close about
and turned over; but old Keitzel was
not to be trifled with, and gathering
the blankets in one hand, he roared:
"But, my son, the busy day, waked i
by the lark, hath roused the ribald 1
crow, and them infernal bogs are in i
the cornfield raisin' hell'n blazes withi
the fodder! Git up, you lazy, anor

tion on the colossal Palace Hotel, in I

Sharon and the late W. C. Ralston
were the proprietors, has been writ.
ten that little remains to be told.
The tale of this prodigious enterprise
reads likei romance, but there lias
been no exaggeration of the project r
or its execution. The hotel was
opened list week, and the event, of a
course, drew out a great crowd of vis- t
itors. The whole establishment was
splendidly illuminated, and the scene
.was very brilliant and animated. On 1
the exterior of the building architect
ural effect i" plain; there is no dis
play of ornamentation; no great t
columns, domes or steeples, which j
might be associated with a building I
covering a hundred thousand square
feet, and seven stories in height.
Blut there is the idea of solidity afid
great strength. Tile ornamental has
been reserved for the interior finish
and furnishing of the lhotel. The
striking feature of the interior is the ~
great open court, with its tiers of
verandas, and lofty sky-light, its
tropical gardens, its walks, fountains
and statunary, which is nncommonly
gay and beautiful. That most impor
tant adjunct of a ihotel is locatedon,
thile garden floor, where the guest will
find that king of the hotel men, War
ren Leland, at the head of a corps of
able assistants.
The servants are all colored, and 1
were brought from the Eanst especisl- j
ly for employment at the Palace Ho
tel. Belmont, formerly the anagni
ficent country residence of Win. C.
Ralston, hais been incorporated with
the Palace Hotel, andis to bIe reserv
ed for the summer resort of its guests.
Every thing about this enterprise hias
been on a scale of the utniost mag
niflcene. The projectors aimed to
give $knat FPitraieeo a hotel building
thie'mosta:thoroughly.planue d ad ex
ecoted -in the world. This will pro.
bably be the world's verdict. Eastern

President Grant's friends should be

morning's pow, Let him go to work
to set on their feet sagain the former
Republlean leaders whom the party
revolted against and overthrew and
there will fdollow another sevolt worse

ROMANCE O1 CArE Cot--ShIe was

The National Governllent has about
as much to lio with the pnhlic school
system a1. it has with the sewerage of
Chicago, or the spiritual condition of
Ilottentots. The reason, then, for the
existence at Washington of a Bureau
of Edlcaltion, with various salaries
oflicials and a mania for publishing
pamphlets, is not apparent-Chlicago
Tribune.
The Bureau of Edneation, which
the T'ibunes condlemms, is simply
some of the fruitage of its own teach
ing as to the entire sipremaey of the
administration at Washington, over
both State and notional athliira. Ac
cording to the Tribne's own position,
the State is nothing, municipal legis
lation is of no moment-all should be
sulmrdinated to a vast central power
at Washington.
The Government has been gradual
.ly acting on this principle, until now
many Republican papers enrnestly
advocated the dictation by the "su
preme Iower at Washington" of the
kind and qnuality of text Ibook, which
shall lie used in all our public schools.
It follows naturally, that there will
not be wanting advocates of a gov
ernment censorship 'of dress before
long, and we shall be told what kind
of boots, hats, coats, and breeches we
can wear.-Courier-Journal.

We once heard of a man who lived

Leng Moss for Irish Potatoes.-Theo
Tampa (Fla.) Guardian of tihe 31st
nit. says: "Mr. Samuel T, A. Branch
has given us a novel way of planting
Irish potatoes and preparing moss for
mattresses at the same time, which is
indeed a good idea : First dig out
your trenches as deep as you desire
them, then put a layer of moss at the
bottom; cut your potatoes and lay
them on tihe moss, then put a layer of
moss over them and throw over your
dirt. Though the season he extremes
ly dry the moss will keep moist suf
ficient to give you- a larger yield of
potatoes than you ever had before,
white and clean, as if they had been
freshly washed in water, and the
moss is now thoroughly dried and
killed, and by washing and beating it
a little you have a nice lot of moss
rean y for mattress-making."

The Most Valuable Tobacco Leaf.-
The most highly valued tobacco in
New England is the thin, tough, elas
tie leaf, which burns readily to ashes.
Those leaves containing the most
carbonate of potash in their ashes
burn the most freely and suitably.
In some combinations potash does
not favor the burning, and some to
bacco manufacturers improve the
flavor and burning quality by arti
ficially impregnating tihe leaf with
acetate, citrate, or artrate of potash,
applying the latter in solution and
then drying. Chlorine injures the
tobacco, as also does nitric acid, Sul
phunrie acid, minited with potash, asda,
or lime, favors the burning of tohac
co. Tilhe tbest tobacco is produced ,m
thie well drained, warm, sandy lands.
