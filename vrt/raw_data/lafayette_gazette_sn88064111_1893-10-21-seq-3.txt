last few days has compelled the
overcoat to make its appearance. s
e The first frost of the season was
seen here last Monday.
-Mr. Adam Primeaux's chal

received here as a hoax. Mr. Le- d
Blanc has repeatedly informed him 
and friends that he would not run
his horse under the conditions that ti
he still insists upon. We find it
useless to mention the subject any
longer, as patrons of the turf, in and
around Royville, are satisfied and
convinced that the two horses will
never come together, for reasons
better known to both owners.
-Several citizens of Broussard
ville were the victims of midnight
robberies the past week. Dr. La
tiolais is short of a gold watch and
several dollars. Messrs. St. Julien

e Bread Made With Soap.
e From a communication read to the As
sociation of Belgium Chemists, it seems that
Continental bakers are in the habit of mixing
soap with their dough to make their bread
and pastry nice and light.
The quantity of soap used varies greatly
In fancy articles, like waffles and fritters it
s is much larger than in bread. The soap is
dissolved in a little water; to this is added
some oil, and the mixture, after being well
i whipped, is added to the flour. The crumb
of the bread manufactured by this process
is said to be lighter and more spongy than
t that made in the ordinary way.-Scientific
