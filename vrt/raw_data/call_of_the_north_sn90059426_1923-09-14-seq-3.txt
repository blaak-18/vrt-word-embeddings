The constitution of the United
States is the greatest constructive
governmental document ever struck off
by pen of man. It brought order out
of chaos. It developed national co
hesiveness and destroyed the power
of disintegration. It softened state
pride and magnified love of country.
It took thirteen weak, selfish and
quarrelling states and amalgamated
them into a national unit It turned
poverty into wealth—discordance in
to unity—distrust into love —local
pride into patriotism. No greater
task ever came to the hands of mortal
men than the task that confronted
the members of the Constitutional Con
vention that met in Philadephia on a
spring day in 1787. There was really
no government. The Articles of Con
federation had proved to be a rope
of sand that bound nobody. The Con
tinental Congress would speak but
each sovereign state treated its de
mands and requests with contempt.
The question was on every patriot’s
lips—“ Would the country survive the
shock of civil discord or would the in
dependence of the states so dearly
bought be lost in the consuming self
ishness of the several states of the
newly formed country?”
The convention was called for the
purpose of amending the Articles of
Confederation, but when the states
men gathered to perform that task it
was soon discovered that what the
country needed was a document that
would create a national unit and
amalgamate the people of the several
Btates into an indissoluble union.
George Washington was chosen as
the president of the convention,
whose deliberations lasted from late
in April until a day in September
when the document was finally passed
and signed. So momentous were the
issues to be decided, so conflicting
were the theories of government of
the members of the convention, so
precarious was the condition of the
country that Benjamin Franklin, at
the conclusion of the convention, with
a voice trembling with emotion, well
said, “Mr. Chairman, at the opening
of this convention I was in a quan
dary to know whether the engraving
upon the back of your chair was a
rising or setting sun. Now at the
happy conclusion of the deliberations
I can well say that it is indeed a ris
ing sun whose rays will shine upon
generations yet unborn, for we are
now a national entity.”
Two paramount conflicting theories
of government were soon made mani
fest in the convention. One class of
men seeing the danger incident to un
limited power through a strong cen
tralized government and having re
cently witnessed a people disentangl
ing themselves from arbitrary rule
were strong for the proposition of
leaving the ultimate power with the
states. These were the so-called
state’s rights statesmen. On the
other hand there was that class who
appreciated the weakness of the Arti
cles of Confederation and saw the ne
cessity of developing a power that
would be paramount to the rights of
the states. This class was known as
the Nationalists or Federalists.
Evolves Splendid System
The battle waged for months with
the result that the present splendid
system of government was conceived
by the merging and amalgamating of
the two conflicting theories.
Probably the greatest credit for the
monstruction of the present Constitu
tion is due to James Madison and
Alexander Hamilton. They belonged
to different schools of political belief
but so great was their patriotism and
so splendid their mental equipment
that they were able to conceive the
system of government which left to
the states matters of purely local
concern and at the same time en
dowed the national government with
a power sufficient to develop unified
action.

The Constitution
How it is Regarded by Klansmen.
By JUDGE C. J. ORBISON
The system of checks and balances
as set out in the Constitution has been
pronounced to be the most marvelous
system of government ever devised
by the brain of man. It was the
first really practical experiment in a
Republican form of government and
the century that has followed has jus
tified the soundness of the opinions of
these men who sat in that convention
hall. The Republican governments of
the world that have survived the
wrecks of political upheavels have
patterned their governments after
this model Constitution. Lawyers
from the beginning have appreciated
and understood the power and beauty
of our form of government.
The 'me has come when the lay
man, the American layman, upon
whom rests and will rest the burden
of safeguarding it, must understand
and appreciate the delicate adjust
ment of that splendid piece of ma
chinery of government known as
the Constitution of the United
States. We are in danger from
friends who would throw a
monkey wrench into this machinery
in the vain hope that they are making
necessary adjustments. Let us fully
comprehend its breadth and scope—
let us see how it safe-guards our life,
liberty, and property from mob rule
as well as from the despotic sway of
imperialistic individualism.
Too Many Commissions
Let it be understood first of all that
the Constitution is an instrument del
egating power from the people in
whom all power is lodged to particu
lar governmental agencies. When
the people in their sovereign capacity
grant certain rights to their govern
ing authorities by and through the
Constitution, they surrender to that
extent their individual rights and
privileges. This is absolutely neces
sary as every man must forego some
natural rights and some particular
privileges if he is to live in a social
state and at peace with his neighbor.
But it is, nevertheless, true that a
people is best governed who are the
least governed. Some people in this
modern age, however, have the er
roneous notion that the more power
that is taken away from the people
and placed with the Government
gives to them a larger measure of
liberty and a greater degree of pro
tection. We are fast running to seed
on this theory of government. Our
national congress and our state leg
islatures are creating commissions
every year that are taking away
rights and privileges of the people
and destroying in a very substantial
way the idea of local self-govern
ment. We now have commissions
that are regulating everything from
motherhood to taxation. It is a re
sult of the peculiar temperament of
the American people who are trying
to avoid the very substantial duty of
governing themselves.
Let us examine some of the work
ings of the constitution in connection
with the present agitation for a
change and re-adjustment of the
fundamental law.
Under the Constitution as it is now
framed, it is necessary for a bill to
pass both houses of congress and be
signed by the president. Each house
acts as a check upon the other and
the president a check upon both..
There are some very good people who
are insisting upon one popular legis
lative house and the abolishing of the
president’s right of veto. They claim
that the senate is too far away from
the people, that their term of office
is too long and that they block the
will of the people through the ex
pression of the House of Representa
tives. They also claim that the power
of veto gives to one man the power of
overruling the will of a popular ma
jority. No wiser provision was ever
made than the creation of two
houses by our Constitutional fathers.
The opinion of a popular majority is
many times erroneous and there is
grave danger of loose and dangerous
legislation when men have been
swept into office at the time of a
political upheaval. To keep close to
the people is a wise admonition and
this is done by electing an entire
house of representatives every two
years. The people themselves con
stitute a check on the legislative de
partment by biennial elections. But
the check, on the other hand, from
excesses in legislation is found in the
election of senators for terms of six
years, one-third of this body chang
ing every two years. Then, as an
additional check, the president has the
right of veto, a right which has al
ways been exercised with caution and
generally for the best interests of the
people.
Again, some people would change
the Constitution so as to give the
president full power to make treaties.
Others would make the senate the
treaty-making body. Under the Con
stitution, the president makes trea
ties by and with the consent of the
senate. Dealing with foreign na
tions is an executive function but so
jealous were our forefathers of the
people’s right that a check was put
upon the executive branch by com
pelling concurrence by one branch of
the legislative department. This
provision has sometimes embarrassed
the president but it has saved the
people in some instances from em
barrassing foreign alliances.
They Planned Wisely
Some people would change the Con
stitution by having the president
elected by popular vote. “The will of
the majority” is a catchy slogan. The
Constitution now provides for the
election of a president by an electoral
college, made up of electors from the
several states according to the num
ber of representatives and senators
from such states and elected by the
people. Our forefathers planned
even more wisely than they 'knew.
Under such a plan it would be pos
sible for a president to be elected by
the people of New York, Massachu
setts, and New Jersey alone. Great
as these states are, nevertheless, the
foreign influences are so great that
the tradition of the United States in
selecting an American president
might easily be upset. I maintain that
the menace that confronts the Ameri
can people and American government
today is the spirit of lawlessness that {
is spreading over the country. ‘Eter
nal vigilance is the price of liberty/
and those who have been watching the
trend of events in America during the
phst years have been profoundly
impressed with the fact that the
American people have not been as
vigilant as in the days of the fathers
and have permitted grave perils to
creep upon them.
• Law Enforcement Asked.
“As Klansmen we are pledged to
enforcement of the laws. Before we
can demand the enforcement of the
laws against others, and by others, we
must ourselves obey the laws. I there
fore call upon every Klansmen in
America to be watchful of his
speech and conduct that he may not
bring reproach upon himself and upon
our organization.
“I have special reference to the
laws prohibiting the manufacture and
sale of alcoholic liquors. If we know
of anyone engaged in the whiaky
business, it is our duty to secure
evidence against him and place it in
the hands of the officers of the law,
and then see to it that the officers do
their duty. We must never take the
law into our own hands on this or any
other account.
“I call upon the Klansmen of the
United States to join in making our
Organization a militant agency for
the enforcement of the prohibition
laws. Let us take the lead; let us
be aggressive.
K-K-K
IF YOU AND I
“If you would smile a little more
And I would kinder be;
If you would stop to think before
You speak of faults you see;
If I would show more patience, too,
With all with whom I’m hurled,
Then I would help—and so would
you—
To make a better world.”
If you would cheer your neighbor
more
And I’d encourage mine.
If you would linger at his door
To say his work is fine,
And I would stop to help him When
His lipe in frowns are curled,
Both you and I’d be helping them
To make a better world.

GARY’S CLEVER SCHEME
The public is tickling itself into
thinking it has made the BIG steel
trusts do something they don’t want
to.
The public says, “Public sentiment
did it.”
When steel workers went on an
eight-hour shift they received a wage
increase of 25 per cent, figuring on
the basis of time employed, but they
actually will receive 80 cents a day
reduction in wages. Under the old
system, however, they had to work
four hours longer to receive $4.80
than they will to receive $4,00.
Thousands of additional blast furn
ace men will be required to care for
the added shift. There are three
eight-hour shifts. There are three
eight hour shifts where there were
two 12-hour working spans.
The actual amount of additional
employes needed will be 65,000 and
poyrolls will be boosted $45,000 a
year.
Who will pay?
The man who buys the steel. It
will come in an increase in steel
prices.
The steel magnates will soon begin
to yell that they cannqt get enough
cheap labor.
They will go to Congress with the
plea for a five per cent immigration
quota instead of three.
The men -who buy the steel, con
tractors, manufacturers, railroads
will’add to the cry.
The result will be a raising of the
immigration quota and a satisfaction
of the demand of the steel magnates
that has been turned a deaf ear up
to now.
Then another flood of cheap fore
ign labor to force down wages and
rob the native-born American labor
ing man of sufficient money to pro
perly care for his family and edu
cate his children in the public school.
It is just a roundabout means of
arriving at an end that has not been
otherwise attainable.
And the public is made to think it
has won a victory -when it has been
the tool of tiie trusts.
KLAN VISION
An Address Delivered in the Klavern of the St. Paul Klan
by a Man who has a Nation-wide Reputation
as a Clear Thinker.
The great word in my mind this
evening is—vision, nor do I think
a more appropriate word in connec
tion with Klan work could be ut
tered. Vision is but another word
for expansion, and expansion is but
another word for progress. It has
been man’s shining cloud by day and
his pillar of fire at night, ever
since his eyes were first opened upon
the elastic world he entered, and it
will be his watchword until earth’s
last possibilities shall have been dis
covered and developed. It was this
that caused men to brave the perils
of unsailed seas, and discover a
new world, and here in the new
world men looked out upon great
virgin territory, staked their claims
at will and dreamed of prosperity.
Their Dream Was of Freedom
Their dream constantly was of
freedom —a country wherein men
should not be taxed without repre
sentation and a country wherein
people could worship God according
to the dictates of their consciences.
It was at Yorktown that the yoke of
tyranny was thrown off, and
here on our soil a government of the
people, for the people and by the
people came into being; a govern
ment whose principles are going the
world around today, an example of
governmental solidarity. During
the Spanish-American war a beauti
ful custom obtained on board the
out-going vessels at night from Nor
folk. The passengers gathered on
deck, and at a psychological mo
ment, the great search-light of the
ship played up against the sky and
over the dark waters, until finally it
caught and held in its arc for a
moment the unfurled American flag
on Fojtress Monroe. Those of you
who are abreast of the times, have
noticed that the statesmen of all na
tions are leading the people toward
the light. Around the Versailles
table, this was conspicuous. Some
one then uttered a sentence, as
someone does now occasionally,
which was as a search-light, pene
trating the darkness and holding for
a moment in its arc the folds of
Old Glory, which contained the prin
ciples of a government of the people,
for the people, and by the people,
for which the world is ignorantly
looking. I say “ignorantly” because
the people as a whole, dissatisfied
with what they have and are, are
groping in the dark for something
better. Americanism has establish
ed itself not only under our flag, but
its democracy is following the sun
around the world. Republicanism
is being established everywhere, in
one way or another. When the
Czar disappeared and the Kaiser
flew to Holland, the last crowned
head of power disappeared. There
are kings and other crowned
rulers today, but they are figure
heads. Well may it be said, “Un
easy lies the head that wears the
crown.” King George receives an
enormous salary. He is King of
Britain, but the Premier of England
governs the land, and he is elected
by the people. During the late war,
Lloyd George said to the King,
“Sign here,” and the King signed,
and Lloyd George was a Welshman,
with neither fortune nor family
rank behind him. He came up from
Cosseth, Wales, out of a cobbler’s
shop, where his uncle reared him,
until the people of Britain regarded
him as their dictator and the people
of the world regarded him as a pow
er. Thus the world around our
Americanism, which sent Abraham
Lincoln, the rail-splitter, to the
White House as President, and which
sent Warren G. Harding, the coun
try boy, to the White House, by way
of the printer’s shop, is penetrating
the governments of every country,
and, while there may never be a
United States of the world, possibly
it would not be for the best, the
time will come when these great
principles for which our fathers
stood will ultimately have established
themselves everywhere. Why these re>-
eults ? Our fathers had a vision,
and their children and their chil
dren’s children have had and follow
ed that same vision, and today they
dwell in a great land of develop
ment, prosperity, and happiness.
We Should Not Be Too Optimistic
However, we should not be too
optimistic. We should not conclude
that all is well, fold our hands and
do nothing, because there have been
other great visions than the Amer
ican vision on the American con
tinent. It was not long after the vis
ion of our fathers began to material-
until certain of our Americans had a
vision of prosperity and ease at the
hands of others, and African slavery
obtained. That was a bad vision.
Then a group of men had a vision
of liberty for the slaves, and it was
not long before the shackles of
slavery fell and the vision was real
ized. Then the liberated slaves
themselves had a vision—a vision of
social equality, and of black suprem
acy and, as a result, we have the
various Negro organizations today,
throughout the South and a number
in the North.
Again, when the possibilities
of this great country loomed
before the world, the Jews began
to come over and they, too, had a
vision—a vision bounded by dollars,
and they have almost realized their
vision, for less than four million
people in American today control
something more than 70% of our
American money.
The Roman Hierarchy Looked
Also, the Roman hierarchy looked
over from its seat on the Tiber
and beheld the possibilities of this
great country, and they had a vi
sion; a vision of universal American
supremacy. Emisarries were sent
over, one thing and another was
tried. When the Civil War came on,
the hierarchy sympathized with the
Southern Confederacy, and even the
Pope wrote President Davis a letter
of sympathy and encouragement.
Why? It was thought at that time
the South would be victorious, and
the hierarchy, ever alert to every
possibility, had a vision of establish
ing Roman schools throughout the
South and making the solid South
Catholic, then with Mexico to the
South, and the solid South; and Can
ada to the North, to hedge in on the
Union from all sides, and eventually
have the Pope rule America. That
vision failed, but the eagle eye of the
of the Papacy has never ceased in
its effort to foresee the time when
the Pope will rule this country. I
might add just here that, back in
the years long before any of us were
born, other men in this country be
gan to have a vision. They were
referred to sometimes as t “know
nothings,” and again as “A. P. A.
S’s,” and again as “Guardians of Lib
erty,” and now as “Ku Klux.”
These men, whose sons we are, back
in the years, began to develope a
vision of equilibrium, a vision of im
partiality, a vision of freedom for
all, a vision that would give every
body a chance, a vision that would
put everyone on a level with one an
other, and every church on a level
with other churches, and that vision
today is functioning through the
great movement known as the Invis
ible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan.
Klan Not a Lodge
I wonder if sometimes a man joins
the Klan without getting the vision.
Men, this is not a lodge. I am not
opposed to lodges, nor are other
Klansmen. Nearly all Klansmen
are members of lodges, but this is
not a lodge—it is a movement. A
movement which takes the highest
principles of the leading lodges out
of the abstract and puts them into
the concrete. It is a movement
which is gathering together native
born, white, Gentile, Protestant men
and women of good repute, red
blooded men and women, American
men and women, who are banding
themselves together for the greatest
battle ever waged on earth; the bat
tle which is to put aside all selfish
ness and place men on a common
Iground. Nor can anyone success
fully molest this movement—it is
going at the rate of fifty thousand
a week and it will soon number its
adherents by many millions, and it
will go to the poles in solid phalanx
and define to all Americans and to
all the world, the word, “American
ism.”
I am a carpenter and you en
gage me to make a piece of furni
ture for you, I do not go to my shop
and pick up a tool and say to my
iself, “I belong to that tool and be
cause I belong to that tool I must
use that tool to make that piece of
furniture.” I say, “this shop be
longs to me, all the tools in the shop
belong to me, and I will use the tools
best adapted to turning out a per
fect piece of furniture.” Until about
two years ago, although I voted for
President Harding when he ran for
the Senate, when people asked my
politics, I was sap-headed enough to
say that I belonged to the Democra
tic party, and I dare say practically
all of you here tonight, if you were
asked, would say that you belonged
to either the Democratic or the Rep
ublican party. The Klan is com
ing forth with a new gospel; it is
saying to Americans, “You are
greater than political parties. You
do-sot belong to political parties.
Political parties essentially are tools
with which to accomplish things,
and the tools with which Aemricani
must work at the poles, belong to
Americans.” Hence, we are. going
to the poles, and we must pick up
whichever tools will cut the keenest
and accomplish the most. We will
use these tools to turn out the best
statesmen and the best laws.
We Are Here to Say It
We are here to say to the Jew,
“You are welcome here; welcome to
open your stores and to have your
banks, but you must take your place
alongside other men, without politi
cal preferences being thrown your
way.” We are here to say to the
Negro, “You are welcome here, but
you must keep your place.” Down
in the cotton-belt, the Negro keeps
his place. At cotton picking time,
when the negroes go on strike for
more money, shorter hours, or some
thing or other, and the cotton is go
ing to waste, and no hands can be
brought in to take their places, the
Klansman robe and march down
through town with their visors down,
and then they all go home
and go to bed, and the next
morning every Negro goes back to
work. We are here to say to him,
“Your slogan, social equality,
which in every Negro’s mind means
inter-marriage of the black race
with the white race, shall cease tf
be uttered.” We are here to say tb
Roman Catholics: “You are wel
come in America; welcome to til
American soil, welcome to conduct
business enterprises, welcome to
have your churches, welcome to
worship God according to the dic
tates of your consciences.” We are
here to say to them, “You are wel
come here with your religion, but,
while there is room for you in Amer
ica, there is no room in America for
the Pope—not even in the spirit of
political rule.” Furthermore, the time
is coming when it will be proclaimed
from the house-tops, and those house
tops will be State Legislatures that
no one shall teach in public school*
who may be sent there to instruct
the children falsely concerning me
dieval church history. Our public
school is one of our cherised institu
tions. In various places it is being
Romanized. Right here in Minne
sota, as well as elsewhere, Romanism
in certain places is being injected
into the public schools.
I say to you, without mental re
servation, that the Roman hierarchy
is a temporal power, and the man or
woman who owes and avows an al
legiance to a temporal power other
than the government of the United
States of America, is not only eli
gible to hold office in America, but
that person is not eligible to teach
in our public schools.
The Tree Teaches a Lesson
As you ride along the side of a
forest that has been torn down by a
hurricane, you behold the bushes ly
ing flat, great trees snapped at their
roots, and your heart is sad. Those
trees have stood, some of them foe
fifty years, perhaps for a century, and
in a moment they were unable to
resist the storm. But as you ride
along, looking out the window, you
see a tree standing, a majestic oak,
its branches twisted and broken, but
its trunk erect. That tree has lived
for a century or more, the storms
have played with it, swinging its
branches to and fro, and have driven
its roots down deeper into the earth,
where they took firmer hold and
gathered from the earth more power,
which was sent up into its trunk
and when that mighty storm came,
twisting its fellows down and lay
ing things waste everywhere, that
tree braced itself against the ele
ments, withstood the storm, although
it was wounded and twisted, and
when the storm passed, it still stood.
I would like to stop the train and
hug that tree.

A BIGOT’S ACT
A “harp” mayor down in Lexing
ton, Ky., caused the arrest of a man
who had joined in the repeating of
the Lord’s prayer in an open air
meeting. That mayor stirred up a
“hornet’s nest” and as a result this
bigot’s act has stirred all Kentucky,
