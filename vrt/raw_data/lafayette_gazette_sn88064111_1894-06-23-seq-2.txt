r
Hons. Clifton R. Breckinridge of
]Keitucky, and Jason 1. Brown of i
Indiana, two of the leading Demo- 1
crats in Congress, have failed to be t
nominated by their party. The
Couriert-sn-al says that tariff re
form did it, and The Atlanta Con- 9
stttution attributes the defeat of
these two distinguished Democrats
t'o their statld on the sivrer question.
It is evident that the peop~ie want a
change and it is probable that the t
members of the present congress
will be the loosers.
As a rule the man who counts the
negro out, will count out the white
man if it is necessary to elect his 1
Mend. Some law should be passed
to purify the ballot, nothing is more
needed in this State. The man who
steals an election from the negroes
ostensibly to maintain "white supre
macy" will steal an election from
white Democrats to keep himself I
or his friend in office. We have
seen examples of it and know
whereof we speak. As long as it is
Sambo who is counted out, it works
like a charm, but when it is white
against white, it is a dangerous prac
ties and a very risky business.
It is a pretty hard matter to kill
the lotteries in New Orleans. It
was Sam Jones who said that if
Tammany hall went to hell, (and
there are many who believe that it
will) the fiaous organization
would elect its own devil and run
thiihgs to s-ft ielf The witty Sam
might have added thas it any of the
old lottery crowd, in New Orleans
go to heaven (and some will undoub
tedly go for, as. a rule, they are
retty good fellows,) they will soon

T5he vote in the- Legislature an
Mr. Mouton's railroad commission
bill was very close, being 39 for
and 4o against. This is certainly
encouraging to those who favor
such Legislation, *when the small
sad almost insignificant support
such measures received at previous o:
sessions is taken in account. One ai
of the arguments of the opponents si
of a commission is that the State gi
should not interfere with the busi- as
ness of railroads any more than in er
other enterprises such as sugar N
factories, livery stables and the m
like, because those who invest th
should be left free to manage their ha
own affairs according to their own s,
ideas of fairness and justice, and to sy
their best advantage and profit. el
This proposition, when applied to g,
these enterprises, is incontrovertible, th
because they are purely private in of
the sense that they are entered into cl
by the interested parties for the t;
primary and exclusive purpose of cc
profit, without regard to any obli- th
gations to the public. They are on ,
a level with ordinary mortals. It in
is evident, however, that such rea-re
soning does not apply to railroads, in
which are established for the pur- B
pose of assisting commerce by the R
transportation of articles produced Jc
or manufactured, in other words, to gE
facilitate and expedite the exchange 0o
between man and man and between e,
communities, of the fruits of theat
labor of every individual. tb
In order to encourage the con
struction of railroads nearly all the ea
States have enacted laws giving
them extraordinary and most effi- a
cient powers and privileges. In fr
Louisiana railroads have the right as
to construct and operate lines be
tween any points, or to intersect, R
connect with or cross any other
railroad; to expropriate property by 0
simply going to the Judge and ob- D
taining a judgment without having ct
to wait until a session of court is
called. They have even more power P
than police juries have to establish C
public roads. The State has dele- cl
gated to railroads a part of the N
sovereign power to take your prop- ci
ertywithout your consent. hi
These are some of the reasons is
why railroads cannot and should not is
be cansidered purely private enter
prises. They are a part of the t;
machinery of the State government, au
with certain delegated power, and of
are amenable to its control and su
pervision, for the same reasons
that the parishes and towns are, as a
part of the government. ti
The State would certainly have L
been recreant to its duty had it not
reserved to itself the right to act
toward railroads as it has of act
ing toward parishes and towns.
In consonance with these principles i
the constitution of the State declares f,
that railways are public higkhways
and railroad companies common t
carriers. -This means that the State n
has- reserved the right to supervise d
them. This power of the State 3
may be likened to that of Police
jurors in the supervision and con
tror of pdblic roads.
No honest and intelligent citizen
should harbor any feelings antag
onistic to railroads because the
State has given them extraordinary
powers and privileges. They are
necessary evils to which we should
gladly submit to secure the benefi
cient effects therefrom in the devel
opment of the material resources
of the c6untry- But, on the other
hand, laws should be enacted to
protect the people against unjust
transportation rates, or discrimina
tion against individuals or commu
nities; or against what sometimes
happens criminal and malicious ex
ercise of despotic power to frustrate
and impede the development of
commerce and industries in certain
localities.
Wants Sunday Law and Reform
NEAR DL'soN, June 20, 1894.
To 'he Lafayette (;azette:
We, citizens of the parish of Lafayette, in
the second ward, are greatly surprised to
hear that our representative put in a bill to
repeal the Sunday Law, stating that the
people of Lafayette wanted it repealed. lie
made a grand mistake. I, "Little Hatchet"
and all my neighbors appreciate the Sunday
Law. God made all that was made in six
days, and rested on the seventh. I don't
think that we are any better than God. I
5 don't think Mr. Monton meant that, it was
Smerely an oversight. We have good law
abiding men in our parish and if those par
e tte who violate the law, are properly put
itefore the court, I think they can be con
virfed, for we have as good a set of otfcers

-Four gentlemen, having a good
opinion of the future of Carencro, di
and abiding faith in the continued, b
success of cane culture, have or- a
ganized the "Carencro Sugar Co."n
and will immediately commence the p
erection of a large mill, or crusher. C
Not wishing, to interfere in any ol
manner, with the construction of
thepropos ed sugar refinery, they
have determined not to manufacture ti
sugar this year; but will make b
syrup and ship it to some factory ca
elsewhere, to be converted into su
gar. The plant is to be erected on at
the Benoit property near the centre
of town and in the rear of the lit
church property. It is estimated T
that when completed the outfit will ha
cost between eighteen and twenty a
thousand dollars. It will be so ar- tit
ranged as to permit of ehlargement, cr
in case future demands should so
require. The gentlemen compos
ing the company are Messrs. C. C. tc
Brown, V. E. Dupuis, and Geo. E. ec
Brown of Carencro, and Mr. J. R. tt
Jeanmard of. Breaux Bridge. These
gentlemen are to be congratulated of
on this show of enterprise, and T
everyone feeling an interest in the th
advancement of Carencro, wishes cl
them every success. t
-Ah There! Don't forget the in
excursion to Carencro on Sunday tI
June 24th and ,the grand festival
after you get there. Tell your
friends about it, so they can, as well
as yourself, avail themselves of the S.
opportunity Of having a jolly time. T
Refreshments at popular prices.
You can get a choice dinner at 25 &
or 5o cents. Lots of pretty girls. s
Don't fail to show yourself at the at
concert. A large number of tents w
provided at the grove in case of bad 01
weather. Did you ever see the
Carencro school children in their
charming calisthenic exercises? w
Now is your chance ! and the $1
children's chorus ! You never 01
heard anything- better. Carencro
is eager to welcome and entertain n,
you. A

and will remain until after the fair A
of the 24th. c

-The base-ball match between t
the "crack" teams of Franklin and 0
i Lafayette, which will take place at a
church grove, Carencro, on Sunday L
24th, will be a treat, and well worth tl
seeing. c
-We do not understand why it t'
is that the police jury does not h
furnish the road from Carencro to
the line leading to Breaux Bridge.
There is a certain distance, where
the trees have not even been re
moved. The condition of this road h
deprives our town of trade that C
justly belongs to us. We trust
that our police jury will give the
matter the attention it deserves.
-There seems to be a strange,
irresistible attraction for several of
our young men, in the direction of
Sunset.
-Hon. A. J. Guilbeau of Breaux
Bridge was a welcome visitor in
Carencro last week.
-The opening of a road or street,
connecting the crosssing just south
of the depot, with the Mouton or
old Breaux Bridge road, is now an
absolute necessity. The proper
management of the proposed sugar
mill demands it. It should be
opened on the east side of the
,Southern Pacific track. We trust
Sthat they, in whose line of duty it
Sfalls, will attend to the matter im
Smediately.
-iBoys and girls, remember the
balloon ascension next Sunday at
Carencro, June 24th.
-~Ve don't claim that our town
is on "a boom," but really there is
something the matter with it.

ha ear o proini as last jiponth.
With littleor no it in Southwest Louisiana,
until the present week, the ground has been "
sun-baked, so hard that a plow could not be
driven through it and auspenslon of planting
enforced. The absence of moisture has
been most serious, no inconsiderable per
cent of the earlier planting, especially
among "Providence crops", killed out
right; reserves of water laid by for later
periods heavily drawn upon and in many in
stances, exhausted. The Upper and Lower
Coasts have also suffered severely for want
of rain, although not nearly so much as in
lying parishes. The river is so low that
spho fall and pumping is resorted to.
Even the latter in many instances is only of
service within two or threeacres of the bank,
that more remote, threatened with extine
tion. There will be more planting along
the Upper and Lower Coast. Rains in the
current week are encouraging; planting
has been generally.resumed and will extend
over into coing month. While prospects
are more favorable, unless there be marvel
lous work done in Calcasieu and other
Southwestern parishes the total acreage is
likely to be less than for several years past.
The good, ground exceptionally free of
grass and methods of culture improved. It
ha been clearly demonstrated that thorough
cultivation and a judicious use of fertilisers
are of benefit, insuring succes under conadi
tions which would ordinarily destroy the
crop. -_ *- a C
"'Outsider' Delighted. plo
To the Editor of The Gazette:
In taking another flying trip down
to the Capital of our parish, (Lafay- -
ette) when I first came in sight of
the Court House grounds, I had to
stop and look, I could scarcely W
believe my eyes. The taking away
of the fence has made such a change.
The buildings look larger and taller,
the surroundings seemed to be all
changed, I was delighted; and when 187
the grounds are nicely levelled, the All
walks put in, and the public build
ings get a good coat of paint, I J
think everybody will be delighted.
