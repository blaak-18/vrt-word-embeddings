—OF THE—
Rapides Agricultural Fair
Association.
First Day.
Tito Second Annual Fair of the
Rapides Agricultural Fair Associa

on Bayou Rapide«, two miles from
Alexandria, on Monday the 10th
inst., and continued four day*, with
large crowds in attendance each
day, and wound up with,a Grand
Calico Ball on the last night.
THK PAIR GROUNDS.
The grounds ot tho Association
are, as has beeu stated above, situ
ated upon tho left descending bank
ot Bayou Rapides, aud about two
miles above Alexandria. They
were known as the Rapides Courue
before tho war, and was one of the
finest tracks in;tho State, if not the
very finest. Tho present"Associa
tion purchased the grounds loss
than two years ago, without a
building on them and havo since
then thoroughly repaired and fenc
ed tho race track, aud have it now
in as good a condition as it used to
be in ante bellum# days; besides
which they have erected a Grand
Stand, Judge's Stand, Exposition
Hall, three Stables and tho neces
sary Stock Stalls &c., all of which
buildings as well as tho fences, are
now neatly whitewashed, and pre
sent a very imposing:*appcaraucc.
The track measures an even mile.
Tho Association is now amply pre
pared for tho accommodation of
visitors, for the proper care of
stock, for tho suitable exhibition of
Machinery, PlantatiouImplements,
fancy articles and everything else
that may bo brought for exhibition.
TnE PRESENT OFFICERS.
At their last meeting tho Stock
holders elected the following Board
of Directors under whoso supervis
ion the present Fair was conduct
ed ; viz :
W. F. Blackman,
J. W. Prcscott,
R. P. Hunter,
W. K. Johnson,
I). W. Hynson,
J. S. Butler,
Jell Wells,
Julius Levin,
J. O. Pickens,
F. Seip,
J. S. Fish,
R. L. Luckett,
lt. II. Carnal.
This Board'then elected the fol
lowing oflicers for their own gov
ern men t :
VV. F. Blackman, President
J. W. Prcscott, Vlco "
J. C. French, Secretary
S. Gullen, Treasurer
J. G. White, Attorney.
To assist them in preserving or

following Marsballs :
Col. J. C. Wise and Mr. W. E.
Taylor, Grand Marshall»—Major
15well, D. T. Stafford, C. M. Flow
er, E. M. Wells, A. G. Compton,
Jonas Rosenthal, Abram Martin.
Besides the Marshalls there was
an efficient force of Police under
the command of Mr. Samuel Fel
lows, who with tho Marshalls kept
perfect order and docorum upon
tho grounds.
thk attendance.
On this day tho attendance was
not as largo as it should havo been
but still there was a largo crowd in
attendance. The Ladies' Stand
was not crowded but was pretty
well filled with tho fair daughters
of Rapides and adjoining Parishes,
among whom we noticed many of
tho beautiful young ladies from the
neighborhood of Evergreen in
Avoyelles Parish, who fully sus
tained the reputation of that sec
tion for pretty girls. Thero was a
large turn ont of gentlemen, and we
may safely say that thero were
eight or nine hundred people in at
tendance upon the first day.
opening address.
At 12 o'clock M., Maj. Blackman,
the President of tho Association
introduced tho Orator of the day,
our distinguished fellow-citizen,
Judge Thos. C. Manning, who de
livered an able, chasto and eloquent
address, which was listened to with
rapt attentiou aud warmly applau
ded. Tho Judge urged upon his
audience the necessity of raising
everything for home use at home,
and demonstrated the practicabili
ty of so doing. He advised the do
ing away entirely with the present
pernicious system ot going iu debt
for everything needed in tho culti
vation of our crops and very sensi
bly pointed out tho way in which it
can be done," by ccasiug to be
planters and becoming farmers, by
beginuinff»t the bottom of the lad
der." We can not spore further
space here, as we would like to do
to report his Speech, but hope to be
able in this or some issue shortly
to lay the Judge's able Address be
fore our readers iu full.
THE DISPLAY.
At tho conclusion of the Address
and in tho interval before tho com
monccmcnt Of the day's races the'
assembly Adjourned to the Exposi
tion Hall to iuspect the articles on
exhibition. The entries were too
numerous for us to make any indi
vidual notice of,them all or even
any considerable jiu mber of them.
Wo can only speak of a few of the
displays made for the premiums
offered in the different Depart
ments. Noticeable among those
was tho display of Confectionary
&c., made by our enterprising
townsman, Julius Levin, and the
rertlly handsome display of superb
Saddlery and Harness made by Mr.
Pulford of Opelousas. This gentle
man tnrns out work that we have
never seen excelled, even in Now
Orleans, and deserves as lie receiv
ed tho first premium for his sad
dles and Harness. The Ladies'
Department was so full of -hand
some articles that we can not un
dcrtake'to^particularizc and must
content ourselves with publishing
a list of tho articles which took pre
miums iu this Department.

well as the outcome. From the

off pretty well together and came
round into the quarter stretch all
in a bundle. From thero to the
Stand Beacon led, with St. George
at his heels, and as they passed un

As this was the last race of tho

the crowd dispersed to reassemble

have taken place on this day was
postponed until the day following :
Noticeable among the stock entries
of this day was a display of Cotts
wool and Southdown Sheep, enter
ed by Mr. Alexander G. Compton
of Bayou B<eut. We should like to
sco thousands of these sheep iu Ra
pides, nnd wo cau very easily have
them if our planters will turn their
attention to the raising ot them.
We have the finest pasture lands to
bo found anywhere. Wo noticed
also several entries ot hay and oot
ton, for tho liberal premiums offer
ed by the Association for those ar
ticles. There was a fine display of
Avery plows on exhibition, from
the house of J. M. Sandidge & Co.

Tho races of this day wero very

contested than on the first day.—
In tho first race of a milo dash, the
entries being W. K. Johnson's Mo
doc, Carroll Jones' Rapides aud R.
L. Luckctt's entry, Bruce, a new
horse, the knowing ones were
mightily taken in. The odds were
as high as five to one on Modoc,
who had so easily won the race of
tho first day. The horses got a
good start and tho race was close
throughout, Bruco winning the
purse, with Modoc second and Ra
pides third.

Tho race was a pretty one. Bo
gus Charley was tho favorite with
the odds offered on him without
any takers. He Jumped the hur
dles in gallant stylo and at evory
liurdlo widened the distance bo
tween him and Gimpsey who was
right after him, but who lost at the
hurdles what she gained between
them. Bogus Charlie won tho race.
Third Day.
Tho attendance upon this day
was uot large but by the time the
races commenced a very respecta
ble crowd was in attendance. Most
pcrsous not caring to attend all the
days saved themselves for tho last
day.

Carroll Jones' b. g lioston Jr.
St. (ieoigc was the favorite
against the field and the betting
was rather free. Tho past two
days experience had learned many
betters to take the field against the
favorite and 110 difficulty was found
in getting bets taken. The three
days races resulted in the defeat of
almost every horse who was the
favorite before the start. The start
was good and the horses kept pret
ty well together to the home stretch
where little Alicc Winn took the
lead from St. Georgo and came
under tho string the winner of the
race. The other horses coming out

rapid stride, when Bruco threw his
rider aud was not again started.
The other throe came out bnt Ra

in his face, and was not heard from
in the next heat. Modoc came out
under a strong pull a long ways a

heat. Time 150 J.
The bcttiug had all been on Bo

from Modoc's let down of the day
before, when lie lost the three year
old race, it was not expected that
he would do anything. In fact, he
was only put in to make up the
racc, but this time it was thought
that Modoc might let down, as he
did the day before.
Second Heat —Thio heat was
entirely between Modoc and Bogus

Last Day.
Tho attcndanco upon this day
was beyond all expectation. Ear
ly in tho morning the road to the
Fair Grounds was lined with vehi
cles of ever sort, kind and descrip
tion, and there was a continuous
tdrcaiu until twelve o'clock. The
Ladies Stand was first filled, then
crowded, then jammed and finally
overflowed with tho fair danghtcrs
of Rapide^, Avoyelles, Natchito
ches and Catahoula and other ad
joining parishes, and presented a
tout ensemble which for beauty,
variety of dress and gaiety of de
meanor has certainly never been
excelled in this parish. Thero
wero 1488 tickets taken at the gato
and this did not cmbrance all pres
ent, as there wero over a hundred
peiHoiiH who w«ro employed oil tho
grounds, some invited guests aud
there was probably altogether
over sixteen hundred people on tho
grounds. Wo heard old citizons
say that it was tho largest crowd
which they had ever seen together
hi this parish. It was remarkable
that among so many people thero
was observed such good order. No
disturbance of any kind marred tho
peace of the occasion, and only ono
accident happened. As ono of the
Knights was riding in the Tourna
mer t a little boy, son of JVlrs. Cath
erine Sullivan, attempted to cross
the track and was knocked down
by the horse. He was not serious
ly hurt.
