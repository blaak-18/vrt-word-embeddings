It is a source of gratiication to
THE every Populist in Louisiana to sonee
how firmly their representatives in
the General Assembly have lined

the temptations and threats of the

know the pressure that was brought

but by unity of action they have
shown themselves a power and
gained the admiration of even their

man, and thus proved their sturdy,

In the support of Mr. Denegre

the oldest and worst enemy they
Syhave ever had-N. C. Blanchard
.. and yet did not suffer defeat them
selves, because Denegre was not
their first choice.
. The ranks of the Citizens League
wavered and St. Paul went over
into Poster's arms, the Democratic

with them as a close second stood

Iril the :Ilegrtions of the white citi
ýod zens of Natchitoches parish, who
ra were, last month ruthlessly cheat
i- ed of their rights by Foster's elec
to tion thieves protected by his armed
militia.
g These nverments are made in the
form and through the medium of a
ul- petition of contest before the court
m- presided over by Judge Ed. IIhn
ter, the district judge in the dis
att trict to which that parish belongs,
ik, and the charges contained therein
will be substantiated by such tes
he timony as will not be questioned.
The consideration of the condi
tions existing in the parish of
Natchitoches will not be amiss at
eo this moment, when the outrages to
which her citizens have been sub
jected are about to be made the
subject of judicial investigation
even such as can be obtained before
a court the result of the efforts of

with the crimes outlined in aMr.

Here is a spot, where for sixteen
years the policy, character and
conduct of what is now brandel as
st Fosterism, had unresistedl sway
under other names.

m zeals and Cunninghams represent
in full measure high heaped all

hand, the political and the materi.

Natchitoches, if it did not give
' birth to the White League move
e ment in 1874, nursed it into vigor
ous action, and her people were
i the first to strike a blow for the
emancipation of our people from
the despotism of that twin brother
of Fosterism-Kelloggism.

That Democracy which they then
virtuously represented has been
debauched by power and the evil '
associations of evil men, and to- I
day it imitates the crimes which
called down the vengeance of these
patriots, and, by force of arms and .
the aid of thieves and thugs, ruth
leesy robs them of their rights a
