Responding to the toast, "Democ

not secured by seeking for it; it comes
as the reward of. right doings. The be

the vociferous -talk about harmony
among those who disturbed it, left
the party and lent their Influence to re
the enemy, naturally recalls the issues th
that created the disturbance and nat- of

the prodigals have repented or demand
repentance of the party.
"The difference which existed on the pr
money question still exists, for whil ci

money question is settled, money is
tight in the great financial conters and co

e CRIBBING JOINED.
The Critical Stage Now Thought to Have
Been Passed
New Orleans, April P.-With the
successful joining of the ends of the
e crib work leading from either side of
n the broken Hymelia levep, an achieve
ment which was accomplished early
on Thursday, the critical stage is con
sidered 'to have been passed in the at
d tempt to close the crevasse, now 700
feet in width. Only the most unexpect
ed misfortune resulting in the carry
ing away of the cribbing can prevent
r the success of the undertaking which.
in view of the extent of the break and
conditions that surrounded it, is re
garded as an unusual triumph in cre
v1 asse fighting. Generally the river
conditions are considered to be improv
ed in Louisiana.
Levee Breaks.
New Orlbans. Aprll3.-The levee at
Union Settlement, six miles below
Pointe-a-la-Htehe, broke iat 5:30
o'clock Thursday morning two miles
above the breaks previously reported.
The new crevasse is already 500 feet
wide and is rapidly enlarging. The
end of the levee is caving in very, fast,
and it is not impostible that a gap tout
miles long will be made in the em
bankment there.
ARKANSANS FIGHT.

Little Rock, Ark., April 3.-A fight a

promptly returned by Mr. Brundige. to
There were a great many members ai

C. Wheeler (Nyin ('riunklIe. wh\o recent

striking essays and books have had a
s large popularity in these I!tter years.
. For a long while Mr. Wheeler had
been out of the bustling field of daily
journalism. lIe had given up the work
of dramatic criticism and wrote in se
clusion under his new pseudonym. It
U is not too much to say that his fame
will live in his later books, the author
ship of which is now revealed. These
were "A Journey to Nature," "The
Making of a Country House" and
"Tangled Up In Beulah Land." The
success of his novels seems to Ie of
the Iasting sort. While he lived he
did nothing to satisfy the curiosity
about the personality of their +author,
but preferred to bte known only
through his books.
The authorship of such books, by a
writer who had already gained( a na
tional relptntit ion by ibrilliant journail
istic work. other books and sone plays,
is a roniarklallte fract in literatulre.

"WRO IN BLAZES IS THIS FELLOW?"
Among them is Richard Harding Da

name across the top. The name is
printed in embossed letters almost an
inch high. When one opens a letter
from Mr. Davis. there is no mistake as
to who sent it.
Some of this striking note paper
reached a firm of New York architects
the other day, kMr. Davis having writ
ten some detailed instructions about
the plans for a house which he is hav

"Say, who in blazes is this fellow
