A GENEROUS OFFER.
Many persons wish to see “a Little
Land and a Living,” which is really
a more advanced book than “Three
Acres and Liberty,” who do not wish
to invest in it.
You see, not then being known as
an accurate observer nor as a prac
tical agriculturist, when the Macmil
lans offered to publish the first book,
I did not venture to state the whole
truth about the profitable possible
productivity of land, —it would have
been scoffed at.
For instance, the average crop of
strawberries in New Jersey (which
with North Carolina is now the great
strawberry State) is about three
thousand quarts per acre. When I
said that eight thousand quarts
might easily be raised, people opened
their eyes as far as was polite, be
cause they knew that many growers
have made money and think they
have done well with five hundred
quarts.
In “A Little Land,” however, I
felt safe in citing a verified instance
of over twenty-four thousand quarts
per acre produced commercially on
Long Island. The grower claims that
he has raised forty-two thousand
quarts per acre and that it paid bet
ter than the smaller yield.
Now I want people to read that
book; so if anyone will inquire for it
at all the public libraries within his
reach, if there are any, does not find
it, and will send me the names of the
libraries that have not got it, I will
lend him (or her) the book, sending
it by mail and trust to his (or her)
native honesty and to his (or her)
interest in others reading it, to re
turn it to me by mail when he (or
she) has finished with it or within
two months. BOLTON HALL.

THE JOURNAL SLIGHTS HIM
NOW.
Editor Jeffersonian:—As I read
your article in this week’s Jefferson
ian on the strike of the firemen on
the Georgia Railroad my breast
swelled, for I feel just as you feel
about the situation, and tried to ex
press myself a few days ago in the
Atlanta Journal and could not do so.
I guess I spoke too plain. Hit too
hard, and consequently my article
found itself in the famous Journal
waste basket.
When I stood with them in their last
political cruise, my voice could be
heard any time. I actually had an
article to once get set up in editorial
style on the famous “left hand edi
torial page’’ and in equally as impos
ing space was commented on as one
of FOUR men whose views stood for
something, but when these white
faced firemen needed a gong sounded
in their behalf, and while I was try
ing to be heard through the paper
which of ALL PAPERS should have
given to me, and to them space, they
were watching with eager editorial
eye the movements of a SCOUT CAR.
I thought I was well enough known
in Georgia to be responsible to the
paper and the public for a signed ar
ticle in the columns of my old friend
the Journal, but not only did I get
turned down, but never had anybody
pay me their respects enough to write
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
me and tell me why the fate of my
article in behalf of these Caucassian
fellows was a sentence to the waste
basket.
I appealed in that feeble article
for the support of the firemen’s
cause by the shippers of Georgia. I
begged them to route their goods over
other lines where they competed with
the Georgia road. I urged those who
had tickets to buy, to buy them over
other lines when possible. I asked
the shippers of goods to remember
this Georgia Railroad who were giv
ing to the Ethiopian preference over
their fellow white men. I urged that
it would never do for SCOTT and the
road to win their fight, for if they
won a fireman fight the time would
not be long before we would possibly
have an engineer fight. I told them
and the people, that with this victory
won that the time might be soon
when our wives and daughters might
be forced to hand their tickets in to
a NEGRO CONDUCTOR who would
take great pleasure in taking them
by the arm at their journey’s end
and assisting them from the trains of
Georgia.
While this was enlarging the pic
ture some, I knew full well that it
was not only possible, but feared the
probability of it, for if w T e suffer
SCOTT and his crowd to get hold of
our people and their rights, we need
not expect anything only rough han
dling.
1 want to thank you, Mr. Watson,
for your contribution in behalf of
these men, for a word spoken by a
brave and fearless man, in behalf of
his people at a crucial moment, is
worth more than the slobbering over
them tor years to dodge the issue,
and tail to speak when something
needs be said.
1 have differed from you, and may
do it again should conscience bid me
differ, but I, as well as tens of thou
sands of others, appreciate the fear
less positions you have always taken
when the under dog was NOT ONLY
UNDER, BUT BEING EAT.
Yours very truly,
EMMETT R. SHAW.

THE RELIGIOUS TRUST WORSE
THAN STANDARD OIL.
Dear Tom:—l am becoming more
and more enthused every day by your
writings. I believe you are right on
every line of thought. But your
Foreign Mission views caps the cli
max to it all. I have been a mission
ary Baptist minister for 37 years,
and have seen the necessity of home
work among our own people, not only
of the Gospel of God’s grace, but of
the necessaries of life and of educa
tion. Some of the leaders of my
own denomination have stamped the
heel of contempt upon me for advo
cating the views that you advocate
today, and of all the damnable
Trusts that ever have existed, the re
ligious Trust of the various denomi
nations is causing more suffering to
day than the Oil Trust, Sugar Trust
or Lumber Trust, as the poor chil
dren can live in spite of those Trusts,
but one collection after another, one
after another, sapping the very life
blood of the little children of our
home land. No free homes for ours,
‘Dfye Jeffersonian
no free lunch, no free treatment.
What a contrast! The poorest feels
the effect first, and continues to feel
it the longest. May God let you live
long to battle against the evils of
the present day.

ENJOYING THE SCOVILLE CON
TROVERSY.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I have just fin
ished reading your editorial on For
eign Missions and am well pleased
with it. I have been reading after
you and Bro. Scovill and it is amus
ing to see how people will still have
such simple ideas about things after
reading facts that you have given.
It reminds me of a man trying to
shoot a 22 caliber cartridge in a 44
caliber. The great majority of peo
ple think just because they belong to
a thing and their bosses say it is
right, it is right, and they don’t try
to see it any other way. There are
not half of the Methodists who can
explain how the missionary funds are
spent, it is also the same with us
Baptists. I have never given a red
cent for foreign missions in my life,
and don’t regret it. If our people at
home were all educated and all had
plenty to eat and wear, I would think
somewhat different.
I am always glad when you pick
up the little kids like Scoville and
shake them. I heard a Methodist
preacher say yesterday, it was the lit
tle weak preachers that were strik
ing at you; that the big preachers
who knew that you had explained the
thing exactly right were sitting still
and saying nothing. I will not worry
you any longer.
Your friend,
F. V. DOLLAR.

CONTRIBUTES AND SAYS NOTH
ING.
I am interested in your controver
sy with the missionary system.
You are telling something that
ought to be known. The extrava
gant expenditures hinder the getting
on with the gospel. And so much
secular admixture leads to provoca
tion in times of uprising.
It is true we have many children
in our own land whose parents are
not able to afford Sunday School
clothes for them. Sometimes they
do not care to.
One thing, our people dress too
gaily for the poor to feel comfortable
among us.
We are in a puzzle. I protest
against sending our system abroad
to be a burden on other poor—but I
give my contribution and say noth
in S- MORE ANON.
JEFFERSONIAN FAVORITE
PAPER.
Dear Sir:—You are well known in
this neck of the woods and you have
many friends here. I have always
voted the Republican ticket nation
ally, but would rather see you in the
U. S. Senate than any man I know
of. I have watched you close on all
matters and you are as near right as
the best of them. Politically, I am
with you for. reform, and your views
on the mission question are mine,
and are right. I like your paper be
cause it condemns the wrong and ad
vocates the right. We take several
but the Jeffersonian is our favorite.
Yours,
R. W. MASSEY.

LIKES JEFFERSONIANS AND POST
CARD PREMIUM.
Dear Sir:—Will you allow space
in your valuable paper for a young
West Virginian to express his most
hearty approval of the principle on
which the Weekly Jeffersonian is
founded?
Also to extend to you my sincerest
thanks for the twenty lovely post
cards which I received with the pa
per, and I assure you they are highly
appreciated, and can’t be duplicated
here at anyways near the price asked
for them by yourself.
I also wish to thank the old gen
tleman in Tennessee for his kindness
in giving me the trial subscription
to the Jeffersonian, and hope some
time to be able to pay him for his
generosity.
Thanking you again for the free
vent you give to your expressions,
and for your most valuable paper, I
beg to remain,
ELMER BOYER."

POPULIST FROM THE GROUND UP
Dear Friend:—Enclosed you will
find ten cents, for which please send
me June number of your magazine.
I believe you are right as to the
mission work. I believe it so strong
that I never intend to contribute for
eign mission money any more.
I read the weekly Jeffersonian and
wait and wish for the day for it to
come. I am a Populist from the
ground up.
May God spare and preserve your
life till the victory is won is my daily
prayer. I hope to grasp your hand in
mine some sweet day.
Your true friend in the fight for
justice,
E. B. HILL.

HOW SHALL WE MEET THIS
CRISIS?
My Dear Sir:—Words cannot ex
press the emotions of my humble and
sincere heart as I attempt to pen you
these lines. By faith I accept the
great truth that an allwise God rules
and directs the destiny of nations
in church and state. In the history
of our own beloved America there
have been three distinct crises:
1st —When He put it into the
hearts of our forefathers of the col
onies to sever their allegiance to the
British government and found a re
public (the greatest the world has
ever known), this God raised up the
men to meet the emergency.
2nd—Was the great contest and
struggle for the perpetuation of the
doctrine of “States Rights,” which
ended in a bloody contest, that ar
rayed brother against brother. Now,
I concede that conscientious motives
prompted all true Americans who
aligned themselves on either side.
This crisis demanded leadership
on both sides which was ably met
by two distinguished and much be-
