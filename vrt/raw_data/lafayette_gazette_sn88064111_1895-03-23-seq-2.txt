cias well as practical bill, especially when it g
catches ne ther you nor 1, so I see very
fied plainly where your bill is right. Yes, I say
the yes again, let those old stags get marnied
and lead a life of usefulness as well as fruit
and fulness, and quit their bad habits and so
s ied ealled single blessedness. And I should also
make marriage compulsory among maids.
not Pass a law that all maids with small months
or must get married, and all maids with large
months get married twice and make a heavy

T'HE NVE I ANTI-LOTTERY
LA 'w. ameo
The passage of the anti-lottery
law at the close of the last session Road
of Congress was an agreeable sur- Bride
prise to thd .frieds of that measure, Total
and was only acdmplished by skill- caui,
ful and, shrerwd parliamentary tac- Juruo
tics. The new-law is a. fit comple- t
. ment to that enacted by the Fifty
first Congress. The defects in the Total
older law were two-fold. While the For
lottery companies were not allowed
to use the mails of the transmission F
of published reports of lottery Tota'
drawings, or for money sent- to the
companies for tickets, the mail sys- Re
tern was still largely used for secur
ing customers; and the express
f companies which do business in the -
y United States did a large trade in
is carrying circulars and other matter
i1 for the lottery companies. The
s new law prohibits any express sys
y tem in the United States from
1 carrying lottery matter between the 7
1 States or from a foreign country to
ta this country. This in itself would
s damage the business of the lottery ism
s companies severely; but the pro- Dist
h vision which shuts out the lottery due
of companies absolutely from using rect
the United States mail either for
the delivery or receipt of postal conD
ed matter is the severest blow. Those bet
a who have studied the lottery ques- des
at tion most closely are confident that Lal
re- the enactment of this provision will dre
he cripple the lottery companies in an ula
Lrt effectual manner; and that the lot- boa
an tery business will be made so ex
to pensive to conduct that operations Bra
of in this country will be greatly cur- Juf
-al tailed, if not absolutely wiped out. BIg
