with parochialism, then, is not alone
the question of building our com

The eternal right of mankind to

In this connection, I quote a gloat
ing paragraph from a recent issue
of tne Messenger of the Sacred
Heart:
“The Argentine Republic which
is one of the most flourishing
states of the southern continent
of America, is about to raise its
legation to the Holy See to the
status of an Embassy, as Brazil,
Chile, and Peru have already
done. The law has been intro
duced by the Government, and
the Argentine Congress will no
doubt soon pass it, whereupon
the present minister, Sr. Garcia
Haneills, a man of great ability
as well as a distinguished poet,
will become Argentine’s first
Ambassador to the Vatican. His
appointment will raise the whole
number o 1 Ambassadors accredit
ed to the Holy See to eight,
while no less than twenty-seven
nations have diplomatic repre
sentatives.”
What the Hierarchy Does to Educa
tion
What does all this mean to Amer
ica?
Particularly, what bearing does it
have upon this present all-important
issue of education?
I can tell you, and out of the
mouth of Catholicism itself. Current
History, for January, publishes a
laudatory article on Mussolini’s re
gime in Italy, by Arnold S. Cortesi,
Rome correspondent of the New
York Times, accompanied by pictures
of the Premier and the Pope, from
which I quote:
“The most sweeping reforms of
all have, perhaps, been made by
the Ministry of Public Instruc
tion. Hie number of schools has
been reduced by suppressing
those which became superfluous
in towns which have lost popula
tion in recent years. The curri
culum has been revised in such
a way that each school, in addl
tlon to preparing the student
for the next grade school, also
supplies him with a complete
education, should he decide to
interrupt his studies at any giv
en moment. Formerly his edu
cation was not complete until he
had finished his course at a uni
versity. Religious education has
also been made compulsory; not
only has the crucifix been order
ed to be displayed in all schools
hut religious education must also
be imparted by teachers who
have the approval of the eccle
siastical authorities * * The re
form which has given rise how
ever, to the greatest controversy
has been the limitation of the
number of students who can re
ceive free education at the ex
pense of the state. Not only has
number of schools been limited,
but also the number of students
who may attend each school,
a minimum of thirty-five for
each class having been fixed. If
there are more applicants than
vacancies, the best students are
selected through competitive ex
amination, the remainder being
free to attend private schools.
The principle underlying this re
form has been this: Formerly,
when any one could obtain a
free education thousands of
young men who would have made
excellent carpenters, plumbers
or manual workers of any kind,
obtained degrees in law, medi
cine or engineering, and then
wasted their whole lives, be
cause having a university de
gree, they considered it below
their dignity to return to man
ual labor, while they were, at
the same time, unable to obtain
employment in their profession,
owing to the steady stream of
graduates being turned out of
the universities each year. The
state, therefore, has decided that
only those students shall obtain
free education who, through
competitive examination, show
that they are worth educating,
leaving the rest to pay the fees
demanded by private schools.
This reform, of course, does not
apply to elementary schools; in
deed, the law making it obliga
tory for every child to attend
elementary school is being ap
plied more strictly than ever be
fore.”
Of course, what they call “this re
form” does not apply to elementary
schools. The heirareny desires above
all else that every elementary pu
pil shall be taught Catholicism.
Therefore it imposes compulsory at
tendance upon the youngest boys and
girls. Also it provides an obligatory
religious curriculum for all such pu
pils. An article in the La Clvitn
Catholics, published in Rome, and
reprinted in the Catholic World,
gives 8 summary of that curriculum
for preparatory and all elementary
grades. It is too long for insertion
here, but its meaning and influences
are apparaent.
Observe, now, how that church
controlled education is operating at
this moment in Italy.
The number of free schools has
been reduced. And that in the face
of the fact that Italy has an illiter
acy more than six times greater
than that of this country, menacing
ly disgraceful as It is here. Among
her population, ten years of age and
over, nearly forty per cent, almost
four in ten, cannot read their own
language. More than thirty per cent
of their army recruits had not even
the beginning of educational equip
ment. The marriages of Italy are
38.7 per cent among illiterates. Yet,
despite those conditions, and their
inevitable results, the influence of
the church is now curtailing educa
tional opportunities
Each school has been made com
plete in itself. Instead of encourag
ing high and higher education, the
Vatican thus virtually invites and ad
vises every student to end it all
whenever a grade is finished.
Free school attendance has been
restricted. Why! To discourage the
training of young men who might
better be "carpenters and plumbers.”
Do I need to ask how, in God’s name,
it is possible to peer into the future
and determine both the capacity and
Mayfield’s Enemies
Would Unseat Him
flourishing
In the new Congressional Direc
tory, Earl B. Mayfield, the new sen
ator from Texas, says his “term of
service will expire March 3, 1929.” If
his political opponents could have
their way, his term would end much
sooner; in fact they contested his
right to be seated at all. The con
test is particularly interesting be
cause it was charged that the Ku
Klux Klan bulked large in the ques
tion of his election. Specific charges
filed last year alleged corrupt manip
ulation of election machinery.
Former Representative Robert L.
Henry of Houston, known as the “fall
guy” of the Texas senatorial primary,
because he entered with promise of
full Klan support only to be double
crossed, went to Washington. He
was auickly joined by Cullen F. Thom
as, who finished a poor fourth in the
primaries, due to the alleged opposi
tion of the Klan and his failure to
hold membership in the invisible em
pire. Henry, wno was a member of
congress from the Waco district for
twenty years and for two terms chair
man of the powerful house rules com
mittee, was expected to be one of
the principal witnesses against May
field.
Thomas, who married a sister of
Morris Sheppard, senior United States
senator from Texas, was considered
a sure winner in the senatorial con
test, until the Klan interposed its in
fluence. He had been a personal
friend of the late President Wilson.
the career of any boy ever born?
Would democratic America tolerate
any such civilization-destroying in
justice to her next generation or
continue to countenance any influ
ence that would sponsor such a mon
strous perversion of opportunity? In
stead, we demand that the advan
tages of education be universal; that
no caste, class or creed be excluded.
Instead of soliciting, we would pre
fer the most far-reachning applica
tion of the principle of compulsion
in school attendance. We are a de
mocratic nation. Our reliance is
not upon ignorance. We have no
fear of too much education. If the
result should be the greatest possi
ble development of mentality and
culture even among those of us who
toil, God above would smile his ap
proval, and we, with every better and
wiser exercise of citizenship. More
than that, the eternal law of here
dity would be aided, not handicap
ped and hindered; with every next
generation would come a heightened
level of common intelligence until
finally Pope, potentate nor politician!
could hope to shackle it for any self
ish purpose.
Teachers In Italy are approved by
the ecclesiastical authorities. Why?
In order that the minds of the young
shall be bent and biased by and to
ward Catholicism. It can have no
other purpose. That is what church
control means.
There parochialism is nationalized,
which is the ultimate aim of paro
chialism everywhere. No other con
clusion is possible. If either right
eously or selfishly, the hierarchy be
lieves in its own exclusive right to
ascendancy, why should it not in the
end seek here the educational situa
tion that has now come to pass in
Italy? And having made parochial
ism a public policy, why is it not
equally logical for them, as they are
doing, to employ parochialism for
purposes Of propaganda?
Church, parochialism, propaganda,
politics,—there you hare the com
plete circle of cause and effect in
the whole field of this discussion.
Through parochialism the church ac
complishes propaganda, and the two
together—ecclesiastically controlled
schools, teaching the supremacy of
hierarchy—lead directly through
politics to temporal power.
“Ecclesiastical Legislation”
The Sentinel of the Blessed Sacra
ment, a Catholic publication, quotes
a Person whom it calls the Venerable
Peter Julian Bymard, as follows:
“The Christian, therefore, owes
to Cannon Law, to the bulls, de
crees and decisions of the Holy
Roman Church, which are but
the law, the teaching of the Sov
erign Pontiff, a filial obedience
beyond all control of the civil
authorities, who in this regard
are without force or sanction.”
Read that again, because, it ex
presses, as you and I must learn, the
attitude of the hierarchy towards
frovernments the world over.
Applied to this nation, it means
that whenever and wherever the sov
ereign people of the United States,
by constitutionally established pro
cesses, through duly elected repre
sentatives, enact any statute in con
flict with any ‘‘bull, decree or deci
sion of the Sovereign Pont iff”—who
is the Pope that the Catholics of
America n re ordered by the Vatican
to disregard that law. In all such
conflicts of legal enactment and pa
pal decree, their allegiance is to

THE FIERY CROSS
nipotent alien soverignity. Yet we
have boasted, and believed, Jor near
ly a century and a half that the se
paration of church and atate had ac
tually been accomplished in this
country.
Our constitution provides for re
ligious freedom. As one result of
that feature of the bill of rights, we
did not insist exclusively upon
church marriage ceremonies; civil
marriages were made by the law of
the land. To Catholicism and all its
subjects that law is null and void.
To them it is wholly without “force
or sanction.” Time after time has
gone forth the papal or priestly de
cree of ignore it, and today, to
them, every American child born of
a civilly made marriage is illigi
mate.
This attitude is by no means con
fined to the marriage statute. It is
the same with anything and every
thing of a legal nature that may
come under papal displeasure. The
Catholic magazine called America,
makes this announcement to Ameri
can followers of the Pope:
“Whatever may be effected by
public enactment with regard to
the rights of men and women be
fore the law, no Catholic is free
to admit any legislation which
tends to destroy the center of
authority in the home.”
Why is no Catholic “free to ad
mit”—and of course to abide by—
legislative acts of the government of
the United States? There is only one
answer. It is because his higher al
legiance is to a religious hierarchy,
not even American in domicile,
whose alien decrees can not aside all
laws as easily as one law.
I say to you that without law and
order neither private nor public
welfare is possible. When establish
ed authority be undermined, then
the very foundations of society will
crumble. Only our government It
self has the right to say that this
law or that law is null and void, by
repealing it or by establishing its
unconstitutionality. For any law to
be ignored either by priest or poli
tician, breeds a spirit of lawlessness,
a contempt for constituted author
ity, which is civilization’s deadliest
enemy, against which no nation can
long contend and endure. The Su
preme Court of the United States Is
at Washington and not In Rome.
No government can become imper
ialistic without ultimate disaster to
itself and to every land it brings un
der subjection. That is the verdict
of history, to which there has never
been an exception. The imperialism
of a church is even worse. When a
religion attains and exercises tem
poral dominion, catastrophe for all
concerned is more swift and sure.
That is what I condemn, not the
American Catholic citizen, but the
Roman Catholic hierarchy.
For centuries education was almost
exclusively church controlled. Prac
tically no other education existed.
That was the period of the great re
ligious wars. Religious education
and religious warfare were simul
taneous. Never in all the annals of
mankind was cause and effect more
closely related or more clearly de
fined.
It made no difference whether it
was Catholicism or Protestantism
that had aggressively or in self de
fense thus usurped this function of
the state. Always it led directly and
inevitably to civil strife and martial
conflict . No religious organization
ever has or ever can dominate edu
cation without an aftermath of dis
ruptive strife.
The degree to which the religious
influence prevails in schools will de
termine, invariably and inevitably,
the extent of the resulting distur
bance for humanity.
I do not for a moment oontend
that America will ever submit to a
degree of church control of educa
tion which would lead to the battle
field, but I do say, with the tragic
experiences of centuries supporting
me that each and every bit of ground
gained by and for parachialism in
our schools will dilute truth, dimish
democracy and feed the flames of
destructive controversy exactly in
proportion to the extent of that in
fluence.
In the last century and a half re
ligious education has declined. Sim
ultaneously religious wars have dis
appeared. That is why I attach such
paramount importance to this fight
for democratic education. “The na
tional safety, prosperity and happi
ness”— and peace—can be safe
guarded in no other way.
I know that if, throughout the
ages, there had been adequate edu
cation —public school education —
conducted upon a plane high above
propaganda, ninety per cent of the
miseries and misfortunes that have
befallen humanity would have been
averted.
And likewise, as we are Christian
citizens, seeking the highest har
mony and happiness for all humanity
we must unabatingly and uncom
promisingly combat every other kind
of propaganda in our schools.
War is a great curse of mankind.
War always has its origifl in reli
gious, racial or economic causes. Un
less the world again embraces the
fatal folly of religious education,
church conflict will remain in its
grave. To bar parochialism and leave
the gates ajar to the teaching of
racialism or industrialism, will not
insure peace. That blessing will
never be attained until education is
completely and everlastingly eman
cipated from every prejudice and ev
ery selfishness.
Let Americans Get Together
Hi is country contains no element
that will not he richly and Increas
ingly benefit ted by the development
of public seltools, nor any element
that will not be Injured, financially,
socially and spiritually, through the
failure to adopt such a program. All
that being true beyond dispute, ev
ery element In America, Protest ant
and Catholic, should stop fighting
each other and unite for the accom
plishment of a correct and adequate
public school system.
There are hierarchies and politi
cal systems, of alien character and
alien domicile, which would not pro
fit by democratic education in Amer
ica. They are not of, by, nor for,
America. I speak not of them when
I voice the hope and prayer that the
entire citizenship of the United
Statea may get together and labor
together for the fulfillment of hu
manity’s highest happiness here.
My condemnation has been of the
political system of the Roman Catho
lic Church, not of Its parishioners,
nor of their religion. It Is the hier
archy, not the rank anl hie of Catho
licism, whose attitude I disapprove.
There is no feeling of intolerance,
nor any hatred in my soul. I speak
not in bitterness, but out of love. I
would that America might bo at
peace. We and the world have seen
enough of religious wrangling and
warfare. At least in this country
there need be no farther conflict. 1
say this to you because Protestant
and Catholic have identically the
same interests at stake, and should
be found fighting shoulder to should
er for the re-Americanization of our
common Republic. All Americans
are men and women whose days upon
earth are far too short to be spent
in any save the ways of amity and
mutual helpfulness. The common en
emies of mankind are sufficient to
keep us all engaged. Let there be at
least one nation within which hu
manity may attain and enjoy a bleas
ed harmony of heart and mind.
Humbly, and yet confidently, be
cause the combined experience of
mankind throughout the ages con
firms both its soundness and its nec
essity, I now make a Christian pro
posal for the ending of religious and
all other disruptive controversies on
American soil.
Let us establish a court for the
settlement of every case of false
hood and fallacy vs. truth and recti
tude. In that court let every ele
ment submit its position to the test
and verdict of unselfish truth.
It would take time to establish
such a court, but once it was in
operation there would be no delay
nor any injustice in its judgments.
A generation would be required to
impanel the jury, because that jury
would be the electorate of the whole
country, not one of whom would be
permitted to serve until his or her
complete competence had been at
tested by a training in which neither
bias nor selfishness had had a part.
Once the common mind of such a
jury had been emancipated from ev
ery influence of prejudice and propa
ganda, its decisions would be divine
ly just. There would come out of it
a new kind of jurisprudence, so gen
erally and eagerly accepted that
within a few decades all our human
ity might live in harmony without
its restraint or guidance.
I propose, then, that all of us,
Catholic and Protestant submit our
difference, to democratic education;
that is, a public school system in
which the mind of each and every
student shall not be bent and biased
by any propaganda, industrial, econo
mic, political or religious. Truth
would come out of such a system—
“ The whole truth and nothing but
the truth.” Factionalism and strife
would disappear, because there would
be no half truth and perverted truth
to give them abortive birth.
After all education is but the
means to an end. In a higher sense,
democracy is but the means to an
end. In the highest sense, civiliza
tion itself is but the means to an
end. That end is the triumph ol
truth, God’s truth and man’s truth,
out of which can come the Heavenly
blessing of a harmonized humanity
here on earth.
America must lead the way.
KLANSMEN BELIEVE
IN THEIR PRINCIPLES
Continued from page 6
“I hear the Klan kind of fixes up
things that ain't right,” another
said. ‘'Well, So-and-so has fixed it
up with the store so I can’t get good
materials, and my work’s go bad I
can’t make a living. I’m going to
join and see if it can’t be stopped.”
And join he did.
“My sister’s husband is off raising
hell in Indiana and don’t send her
enough to live on,” remarked a third.
“They’ve passed word to the Klan
out there.”
These are only a few. The Grand
Dragon of one State told me he got
twenty requests a week for action in
just such cases; another put his calls
at fifty. I believe that, on the
whole, the desire for this kind of re
form has been more powerful than
any other one thing in drawing men
into the Klan. It is a very human
and often “neighborly” desire, sup
ported by the simpler morality, and
it is hard to make "plain-minded”
folks see the gross violation of fun
damental principles which makes it
vicious. I even notice that people
who do see this, and disapprove on
principle find it hard to work up
much indignation over actual cases
where they believe the victims are
guilty. Action along these lines is
not on the official Klan program and
is being discouraged by the leaders,
but without either the vigor or the
success of the campaign against vio
lence.
These two are the great unavowed
motives in the Klan. Other motives,
still reformatory, follow closely the
lines of the propaganda.
“They’re going to give Ohio and
Indiana the biggest cleaning up you
ever heard of,” a Veterans’ Bureau
worker reports. “They’re after every
little thing—crooked officials, crook
ed business, vice, crime, Sabbath
breaking, poor schools, and all the
rest.”
This is the official Klan program.
Even in the “night-riding States” I
found many who had joined for these
reasons. And everywhere, of course,
there are very large numbers who
have joined because the Klan seems
to them to offer a solution to the
great National questions of hyphen
ism and unassimilated immigration.
This, then, is the nucleus of
thought around which the Klan has
been built: Reform, sometimes sel
fish and sometimes public-spirited,
sometimes merely meddlesome, some
times well founded and using the en
tirely proper methods of opinion
and votes. Often it is a mixture of
all these elements. The means used
are based on the relative state of
civilization of the men or the com
munities in which the Klan has call-
ed it into action.
But always it is reform of one kind
or another, and, however warped or
mis-directed, it is almost always
aimed at some real wrong or abuse.
It may err in ascribing the evils to
Catholics, Jews, or aliens, but the
evils themselves are real enough.
In other words ,the Klan move
ment seems to be another expression
of the general unrest and dissatisfac
tion with both local and National
conditions—the high cost of living,
social injustice and inequality, poor
administration of justice, political
corruption, hyphenism, disunity, un
assimilated and conflicting thought
and standards—which are distressing
all thoughtful men. The Klan is
strong because it offers what no one
else has offered: a solution which is
fundamental and all-embracing in
that it calls for a retdrn to a time
honored basis and standard. The Klan
also, has been wise enough not to
promise any complete cure.
So the thing for which the Klans
man pays his money ,the thing for
which he works and which holds his
loyalty is simply guidance in carry
ing out the reforms he demands.
This is the nucleus, but it is not
all the Klan. There must be added
the accretions which gather to any
growing organization and a few
which are peculiar to the Klan it
self. Among the latter are the “hat
ers” whose prejudices are always
strong and who react violently to the
Klan propaganda, the hot-heads who
are attracted by the chance for my
sterious and violent action, the
youths who want “fun, romance, and
swagger,” and the cowards who hope
under cover to satisfy private
grudges. Among the normal burrs
are the “joiners,” the people who go
with the crowd, those who have de
finite ends that may be helped by
the support of any organization, and
the parasites.
The attitude of Dr. Evans, the Im
perial Wizard, toward these various
motives in Klansmen has been fairly
well reported in previous articles.
Tw’o further remarks of his bear on
the subject. I had pointed out the
large number who joined from mo
tives very different from those the
Klan avows.
“Human emotions and human mo
tives are the same the world over
and since the world began,” he re
plied. “Of course, in a vast organi
zation, with its millions of members,
there are bound to be undesirable
individuals. This is true in the most
serious way during the propagating
period. There is an intangible some
thing, however, in the Klan that
searches out the hearts of men, and
it has been the experience that the
man who has joined for selfish or in
tolerant reasons is very quickly con
verted or driven out.”
“Is not the large part of the mem
bership of the unbalanced, hot-head
ed type of young men?" was another
question.
“No, I would not say that,” he de
clared. “I would say that the Klan is
composed of young rather than old
men, but it is the young men of the
balanced minds who are the stamina
of the Nation. I have seen audiences
of many kinds, and I will say that
Klan audiences will compare very
favorably with any audience you have
ever seen.”
It is impossible to make more than
a guess at the proportion of the
various motives which lead men to
join the Klan. It differs in every
community. But, taking the coun
try as a whole, I should guess that
the parasites number less than five
per cent of the whole, the actual
haters and trouble-hunters another
five per cent, and the “joiners” about
twenty per cent. The remaining
seventy per cent seem sincere re
formers, however mistaken. About
half of them, I believe, are moved
largely by the desire to remedy
things which cannot be reached by
law—the largest single element —
and most of the rest by hope of lo
cal reform of some rather valuable
kind. Those actually moved to join
by the National aims of the Klan I
should not put above ten pier cent.
But all of tnese motives overlap, and
I should also guess that at least sev
enty per cent of the Klansmen would
work with some vigor for local re
forms, and almost as many would
support the National program.
There is one more thing about the
composite mind of the Klan which
may be interpreted in different ways
but cannot be ignored. This is a cer
tain intensity, purposefulness, some
times unselfishness, which the Klan
seems to instill into the bulk of its
members. There is, of course, a great
background for emotionalism in the
Klan aims and forms of appeal; the
Klan seizes on this, strengthens and
uses it. To many Klansmen the Klan
doctrine has come with the force of
revelation, sacred, over-mastering,
and with most of the elements of re
ligious conversion.
The result depends on the charac
ter of the man, but it is to be felt
in some form in every contact with
the Klan. It rises sometimes to the
pitch of fierce fanaticism, with all
the shocking and terrible splendor of
that form of obsession. Nothing less,
for example, could have held the
Klan paraders standing in the streets

as enemies, and strikes with equal
vigor at crime, corruption or criti
cism. A correspondent in Dallas
writes about this:
“I have reason to believe I know
the psychology of the Klansmen. It
is a modern Mohammedanism more
than anything else. And great is the
Grand Titan. It is semi-religious,
yet it is a religion of violence, pro
pagated by violence, and its adher
ents are modern fuzzy-wuzzies in
business clothes. No more cowards
than other men, but selfish, egotistic,
and dangerous modern fanatics, and
at the slightest show of disagreement
the sword is brought into play and
the *Christian dog* is slain. (Except
that the sword is the six-gun.)”
There is truth in this condemna
tion, yet it would fit Cromwell’s
Ironsides or the Salem Puritans—
any strongly convinced body of men!
The Klan spirit does not run to six
guns in Ohio and Indiana, where the
Klan strength is now centered, but
that seems a matter of the customs
of the country. It is nearly as in
tense as in Dallas and similar places
even if less raw and it can Better
be called devotion or consecration
than fanaticism. Certainly that is
the pitch at which the Klan leaders
try to hold it. But the difference in
spirit between the two extremes of
the Klan is one of degree; there is
still the semi-religious feeling, the
resentment toward opposition, the
narrowness and often intolerance. It
is more than a co-incidence that
everywhere the Klan is linked with
and supported by the narrower, less
liberal churches, and that most of
its members are “Fundamentalists.”
In Ohio, for example, all the Pro
testant churches are more or less in
volved except the Congregationalists
and Unitarians.
This, then, is the mind of the Klan
as nearly as it can be seen. A mind
with mixed motives, generally well
intentioned, confused, warped and
illogical, or sane and clear, in dif
ferent individuals. It includes pur
poses very different from those the
leaders profess, and prejudices and
hatreds they are trying to control.
And the whole is driven by an in
tense emotionalism which makes it
a tremendous power ,and makes it
doubly a menace whever it goee
wrong.
The means by which the Klan
makes this power effective, the meth
ods and weapons it uses, and the ex
tent of the control which the leaden
have over the mass of members will
be reported in the next article,
“The Power of Invisibility.”
