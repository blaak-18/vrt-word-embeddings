SUICIDED.
me Mr. L. Renou Ends His Mortal
I. Career,
Monday morning the body of it
man was found in cane trivet just
3f back of Tujaque's bakery, which
1 was soon recognize I as that of Mr.
II . Renou. Every indication points
'h to suicide. His clothing and the
contents of his pockets were on
the bank beside him, a bullet hole
p in his head, and a small revolver
t. told the tale too plainly.
d D.cceased came here about two
) years ago and engaged in the gro
. cery business with Mr. L. Dupleix;
after a short time his business was
closed out and he was forced upon
the world old and penniless.
w The unfortunate man was ad
re dicted to drinking, which may be
ws attributed largely to his failure to
5, keep up business.
I Finally being poor, aged and des
s pondent, he sought the land of
on ever dreamless sleep ; thinking to
a fimn a solace for the troubles which
r. were his-ia this world, he snapped
the uilken eord of life and leaped
to meet the nameless terrors of the
' great unknown. Peace be to his
Ssoul.

Editor Louisiana Populist :
It has Ibeen soime timeiinc'e Chal
er dtots were last seen in your valu
able paper, so I take this opportu
nity of informing its re:alers of
the goings on at and around this 1
plae .
The farmers here are veiy much
disheartened by the present condi
tion of the crops, bat like true
christian, they bear their burdens
and complain not.
Again another Fourth of .Jul
has come and gone, and with it
has been renewed that feeling
which is ever present in the hearts
of the American people. It is
pleasing to note that the good peo
ple of Chaler and Melrose, were
not behind others in honoring the
day which gave to them all that
they now are. At about nine a.
m. a large crowd assembled on the
high banks of oar beautiful "Ol
Cane" near Melrose, where, in the
cool shadows of tall cotton trees,
the (lay was spent with much profit
and pleasure. Too much credit
cannot be given to those who so
carefully prepared the eleidant din
ner, as well as to those who were
so kind and thoughtful as to serve
iced lemonade all through the af
ternoon. At night the young folks
met at the residence of Mr. Jor
don's, at Melrose, and enjoyed
themselves in different ways, prin
cipally dancing, until the clock re
minded them that it was Sunday.
On the night of the 3rd a dance
was given at the residence of Mrs.
Rougee's, complimentary to the
visitinmg young ladies and gentle
men-Misses Cocktields, Rachal,
Jones, and Sutton, andl Messrs.
Gillen, Fontenot, Rachal, Morcoun
Cockfield, Neelanu4 Oneals, and
Burnstein. The music and refresh
ments were all that could ho desir
ed, and it was not until the sun
began to peep from behind the tree
tops that the crowd began to say
"Aurevoir, but not Good Bye,"
and to express their enjoyment of
the reception.
While at Chaler, the Miss Cock
fields and Miss Rachal were the
guests of the MissGrimmers, where
they received much attention from
the friends of that hospeitable home.
Several neat gatherings were given
in their honor by Miss lHeloise and
Miss Marie Grimmer, anmi it is
hardly necessary to say that they
were enjoyed by all present; Miss
Heloise is quite a favorite here and
one always feels at home and in
good spirit when in her company.
We were all glad to welcome
home Miss Marie Grimmer, after
a. absence of several months in
Natchitoches, where she has been
attending the Convent. Miss Grim
mer is an accomplished young lady,
and her pleasant disposition c'Mndears
her to all.
A crowd of young folks will I
leave Chaler soon for a camp at
Chopin's lake.
The many friends of Mr. Benj. ,
Boydstun are glad to learn of his 1
return from Ruston, where he hasi
been taking a special course in the t
Industrial School.
The young folks stormed the
Miss G(irinmmers for a dance Satur
day night.
Mr. Percy Smith and brother,
from Robeline, spent~ several days
last week with Mr. J. T. Jordan
Jr., at Melrose.

of the death of his wife, which oc
curred Wednesday evening, July

Do you know that the gold bugs
are more dangerous to the agricul
tural classes than any other bug in
existen-e. Other bugs affect the
quality and quantity of what you
raise. Gold tbus affect the price
of your produce. The other bugs
have the first chance at your pro
(duce, an I what they leave, the gold i
hug controls. What he leaves is
for you.
Natchitoches has a reform City 1
Council and is out of debt ; 1'roof
The Council accepted a bid of 30
cents per square for work which it
could have gotten done for 1G}
cents. Democratic you know.
A had wreck was replºrted on
th! T. & P. road near Oxford, La., 1
on the loth inst. Thirteen cars
were ditched and their contents
scattered around promiscuously.
No one hurt. The damage will ap
proximate $100,0)00. The regular
passenger trains were delayed a
few hours, but were running on
schedule time next day.
We have sme "hot stuff" from
J. E. Selby of ward five. It casme
too late for this issue, but will ap
pear in our next.
Monroe, La., held an election on
Tuesday, July 7th, to determine
whether or not whiskey should be
sold in that city. A total vote of
633, of which a majority of 264
for the sale of intoxicating liquors
was cast.
From now on Monroe people
may "smile" without patronizing
the blind tigers.
The Democratic platform adopt
ed at Chicago, on the 7th, does not
contain a single word .about fair
elections. Perhaps if it did, it
would'nt be Democratic.
It does not reach quite as far as
the Shreveport platform of '"95",
as it contains a Cuban plank, and
the Shreveport one relative to
Venezula. The only redeeming
feature is a declaration of free sil
ver, which the party begins to off
set by running gold standard mnen
in many places for Congress.
The Alexandria Ice and Cold
Storage Co. has commenced opera
tions, andt are now running on
schedule time.
Moved, that the city printing be
given to the lowest bidder. Lost
for want of a second.
The Populists occupied the base
ball grounds for about a week af
ter the recent election. Since they
vacatedl; the militia may drill
there.
Although the city revenues are
less this year than last, the City
Council huntedt oit and gave their
printing to the highest bidder.
Our Democratic friends are cui
riotms people. They are atout to
rob the Populists of one of their
leading planks, and then trot off
in triumph and ask us to hitch on
to their tail. It seems to us that
it would be much more appropri
ate for them to attach themselves
to us as we are the only original
free andt unlimited coinage of sil
ver at 16 to 1 party. Curious
things are polities.-McDuflie En

To the Editor of th!i Polulist :
Sir-After seeing the procee lin,2s
of the Poli:'e .'1iry I have conelua
ded to send you a few of the setll
I tiucnts of ward 3. We ci mnui lcrr
that we are for fairness an l justice,
andl tha:t only.
We congratulate CiMr. hKlh u(pon
the honest vote he cast in giving
the clerkship to the Populist, which
we believe exonerates him from
Ring rule.
We elected a police juror from
this ward, but he has not been se :t
ede, anl now I wish to inform any
one aspiring for the position of
police juror of this ward, that he
is seeking for an unenviable lposi
tion, for the edict has Ibeen declar
ed and printed ipublicly, and now
any man that has the cheek to at
tempt to fill the position if ap
pointed by the l)emocrats certain
- ly is a very brave man, for the
Speopllo have declared that no one
shall serve if not elected, and they
still stand by this resolution.
The greatest trouble we have, or
the place it originates from is
from the chief l)ictators in this
1 parish, of which th:.re are albout ;,
and now fellow citizens, if we could
swap off five of these t,r a 'ellow
dog and then kill the dtl e,, you
could expect h:arm mny in this par
1 ish, and not until sonithiin of this
kind occulrs c:tn you expect any
political-I:Iariony.
The people :are waiting with
f hopes that the court will soon take
p action in the contest case, and set
tie the trouble in this pari-h. And
now the majority of the people
feel that they have made their last
e appeal to civil justice, the decision
l has been left to the Courts, and
ample time given for a just con
sideration of the case, and this de
mand has not been made for bluff
or blow, but to exhaust all civil
t and honorable means to obtain our
r rights, which we want and must
t have at all hazards.
We desire all friends for justice
to stand by ns.
CITIZENS Or WARD 3.
A Chicago genius was recently
granted a patent on an automatic
fishing rod. This great labor-sa
ving device consists of a rod and
holder cocked and po)ised uplon a
strong spring. In this position it
may be left upon the shore by it
self after the owner has Iaited the
hook and cast it into the water.
When the fish seizes the bait, the
tug it gives the line opens the trig
ger, and the fish is jerked ashore
and landed high and dy by the tin
coiling of the spring. This inven
tion at once removes fishing from
the list of laborious occupations
and makes it nothing but pastime.
Labor Pays All Debts.
All wealth conmes out of the earth.
This fact should be kept in mind.
The way it is extracted from the
land is also important.
It can only be drawn from the
soil by the application of labor to
land.
Thus it will be seen that all of
the debts and taxes are paid by la
bor applied to land.
The most difficult thing in tie
world is to secure for this fact a
lodging place in the human mind.
The mnerchant thinks probably
that he adds to the wealth of the
country by selling goods at a great
sacrifice from his bargain counter.
He does not add a penny to the
volume of the nation's wealth.
The banker may think he adds
to the national wealth by the prac
tice of usury, skinning the people
on hik l:tns.
ray think they IIII4l to w.1 It IIV
r d,+irrv of both lihe pro i ,- and
the 't nsIliIer.
\I l4lle it inn never i'r. loI one
Spenny of national wealt:i.
And so it _oets wvith all ,la s"-' of
r business and professioni:lI men.
Tlwhv :are consumlers of wuº;ith, hilt
thlitr !to not produce a cent.
A M!! wealth being created hv la
bor, it follows that all of the delt.
b of government, national, state andl
Siunicipali, fall to the lo't of labor
to pav'.
SAn another important quest"lion
to be renlembered is that the L'eat
or the debts, the heavier tax andt
the less ltbor derives in the way
of wages for producing weoalth.
When the debts I ecome sufficient
ly burdensomil then labor becomle a
condition of absolute hlavery.
