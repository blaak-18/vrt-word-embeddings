We publish in full the speech of
Governor LoUIs A. WILTz deliv.-red
before the Convention after his nom
i Ination, which was received with
great enthusiasm:
re FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE DEMOCRAT
to PARTYI.-I necept the ntolrtinlin,'I
Sto, be (g.v.rnr of I ,uliailýtOs witl
. profound ektibo.d tlmoInt for thle
manifestation of eo1ntllienee extend
eld to me In ceonfrring it on mree. It
happene for the first time in the his- 1
tory of the party it this H'ate. that
Its choice for the omeli of Chief Ma- I
gltitrate has fallon upoo a citizen of I
its chief city. The eonsideretion of I
hbls fact enhaners, if that were po- I
,lble, the sense I must entertain of I
the great honor done me. It is not I
my purpose to dispute the right to
select candidates for the party from I
whatever place withing the borders 1
of the State. Party strength and 1
harmony are to be preferred to mere I
sectional claims, and fltness for pub- I
lie place and merit are the true con- I
siderations upon which all appoint
ments to public place ought to de
pead. Happy it Is for the republic
that I am able to add that the Demo
cratic party has constantly 1
sought the best Interests of the en
tire people, without regad to mere
locality. In Louisiana it is a just
source of gratulation that the Demo
cracy can refer to members of its or- I
ganization all over the State, in the t
g. grades of Carroll, on the shores oi 1
the lakes of Caddo, beneath the 1
groves of St. Tammany, on the plains (
of the Atakape, among the hills of c
the North, on the wooded banks of 1
the Ouaehita and Achafalaya, in the t
a fertile valley of the Red river. on the
* farms of the Southeast. on the banks a
Sof the Mississlppi. and on the coast I
of the restless Gulf, everywhere, are F
to be found fellow-citizeps of our
common political association; men 1
of courage, character, patriotlsm and i
' talents worthy of the highest dignity
' of the 8tate. t
I Fully sensible, therefore, of the !
Ssituation in whibl I stand, it would I
be highly unbecoming in me to a- t
some that personal considerations c
[only have Induce the choice you
a have made of me as a can(lidate for t
Governor. Known by my share in c
the public history of the State and c
times as a friend of good government a
r as the promoter of Internal Improve- t
I meats, an advocate for the education
of all, as a firm believer In popular c
h rights,and the authority of the body c
of the people to control the poliky e
and destinies of the State; having c
constantly Insisted upon the duty of l
obedience to civil rule, to law and to a
order, the subordination of military t
authority within its true bounds, r
and the preservation of the rights of j
the States within the limits aonoint- a
ed by the Cantitution of the United 8
State, I mcan have little, if any, doubt t
thatthe present choice of the Con.

are neooeseay to free governments, s.
and that the best results me apt to a

party contests give rise, It may not r

running over it, I have tried many rem
a edies without avail, until several months
I. ago I commenced the use of "Normand's
Balm," which has been of great benefit
and is the only application, of the many
tried by me, which has afforded substain
tantial relief-I regard it as invaluable
. and cheerfully recomend it for the cer
tain cure of bruises, wounds, cuts, indam.
mation and ulceration.

MR. J. H. NonMArXD, Cloutierville, La.
Dear Sir-After suffering for thirty
years from a running nicer in the ear
occasioned by a wagon passing on my
head and after having been operated
I upon by Dr. Logan in New Orleans and
and not being cured. I tried some of your
balm and lain happy to say that after a 3
few applications of it I got entirely well
and was radically cured. 1
A negro boy on my place cut his foot
*with a plow and it was thought once e
that it would have to be amputated but e,
after applying your barm on the wound t
for a few days it healed up and the boy of
Sis now well. Again, George Cole, a
neighbor of mnine, whilst shooting a gun,
a piece of the csp flew iu his eye, we al
Stried the balm again and with suceess.
His eye ot well after two applications
of the brimi.
I conelade by stating that hi my opin.
Sion your balm is an invaluable iuedicine
Sand I will take pleasure in recommend.
ilug it tothe public.
Very respectfully,
W. A. CURRY.

Messrs. Nonasxo & CHOrPs:
Oents-I take pleasure in reormmend. s
Slg your Balm. I have always found it n'
Seflecacious. Some four years ago an old o
I colored servant of mine was confined to
S her bed with an ulcer on her leg. My nI
wife lelieving strongly in the virtue of
your Balm, concluded to use some of it
and in s very short tine eaffected a caure. D
; The oid woman is now well and able to
Stestify to the same.
