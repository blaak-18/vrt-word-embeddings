THE GROUND HOG.l
CONNECTION OF THIS ANIMAL
WVITIi THE WEAT'HER.
.i Ta!k !, an .'uthoii--rv on the Sbhiect.
Questioned Absut Pilanting Po
tatoes and t'h Reply.
It is said that "truth iý stranger than
fiction, and ;n this relation may be
c-1neccted the ground hog and the
nveather. From an authority on the sub
iect which can not he questioned it is
said that cn the mor.:ing of oe n s.-con L
m.ivy of Febrnary cof this .,ear the ground
hr, crawled fro:: his hole, eand after
tal ing- a survey of the s!r.. n:dings. "F
which were net to his notin. he blink
ed left eye, gave a grunt of disapproval,
crawled into his hole and pai:. the hole
after himt, and that fort: datys thereafter
he will crawl out of his hole and stay
oe-cr ground. dry or wet. cold or hot,
regardless of all conditions. This ex
pounder on the ground hog asserts that
his forecast of the weather is infalli
ble and he would put the hog's prog
nostications against he best barometer
and weather forecasters on the face of
the globe. "On February 2," continued
this authority, "and bear in mind it was
on A Monday the ground hog who is not
as big as an elephant;, on getting over
ground frisked his little tail and saw
his shadow on the ground. That .was
enough and he immediately crawled
back and there he will stick until Sat
urday, March 14, when the forty days
of his crawling will have ended and he
then crawls out in safety. The ground
hog is a peculiar animal, but he knows
a sight about the weather. He no doubt
knew there was to have been a lot of
rain and he did not propose to stay out
of ground and run the risk of being
drowned. Now, if on the day .he crawl
ed out, the indications would have been
cold and freezing he would have crawl
ed back -as quick, as it is not to his lik
ing to stand cold weather and exposure
and be frizzled up. If when he crawled
out the indications would have been fair
and pleasant he would have stayed out
and instead of rain we would have had
fine weather, but the ground hog's al
right. After Saturday. March 14, you
watch for the sign of the ground hog
and my name is not · if I have
not told the truth. From March 14 the
weather will be favorable, and if the
season for farming and planting is late
tlhere is plenty of tiua i_~a big birves,
him when- he had crawled out of the
ground. He was fat and slick, which is
a sign of prospetity for the year, an
abundance of good things for us all,"
and having delivered himself on the
ground hog( in a fashion interesting to
his listeners and delightful to himself,
a skeptic in the crowd queried of a
friend: "Say, Joe, when do you plant
potatoes-in the dark or the light of the
moon?" "In the ground, sir," was the
quick rejoinder. With this abrupt end
ing, the crowd dispersed, leaving the
ground hog man to his own meditation.
But jest as you may or will, the
ground hog is all right and don't you
forget it.

Natural Causes.
New +4k- March 7.-The mystery
snr the death of .the woman
whose b a$ found in a furnished
roomi au %.xe on West Thirty
sevesn .harsday night has
been _ ea~d by the statement
of a who zia1ned the body
and dtiee womba prob

of a dark liquid, the landlady's sister
says she heard him say: "Don't for
get to take this medicine. You know

NO DECISIVE MOVE.
Material Evidence as to Identity of Bnr*
dick Murderer Is Lacking.
Buffalo, N. Y., March 7.-Despite the
fact that the police and officials in the
district attorney's office repeatedly as
serted they are morally certain of the
identy of the person who murdered
Edwin L. Burdick and that that per
son is a woman, they still hesitate to
make a decisive move. Suggestions
that might give a clue to the motive
for the murder have been eagerly
sought and sifted. Innumerable clues
have been followed. The police say
many of these strengthened the sus
picions until they are almost positive
of the identity of the murderer, but
material evidence is lacking.

A PATRIOTIC APPEAL
For Funds for the 1%0me for Needy
Confederate Women.
(To the Caucasian.)
Richmond, Va., Feb. 27, Igo3.-Dear
Friends: The managers of the Home
for Needy Confederate Women will
hold a fair at the Masonic Temple,
Richmond, Va., for the benefit of the
Home, beginning March the I6th and
lasting ten days. The women who bore
the burden in the dark days of the Con
federacy are now, by reason of increas
ing years, unable to care for themselves.
Their natural protectors laid down their
lives for the "Lost Cause" and have left
the care of their loved ones as a sacred
legacy to uk who have succeeded them.
The in.e is o e a
many survivors of thrse times that tried
men's souls. It was opened October 15,
Igoo, since which time it has cared for
seventeen needy Confederate women.
But many applications have had to be
rejected for lack of accommodations.
We need more room. The State of
Virginia has given five thousand dol
lars, and this fair is an effort to increase
that amount as much as possible, in
order to have a sufficient sum for the
erection of a new building, better suited
to the needs of the Home.
Mrs. A. J. Montgue, the wife of our
esteemed governor, is president of this
committee, and joins us in an appeal to
you for a contribution to this fund.
All checks should be made payable to
the Home for Needy Confederate Wom
en. All packages should be carefully
marked "Home for Needy Women, care
of Mrs. A. J. Pyle, No. 213 E. Grace
street, Richmond, Va." ours for a good
cause,
HOME FOR NEEDY CONFEDERATE WOMEN.
By Mrs. A. J. Pyle, Treasurer, No. 213
E. Grace Street, Richmond, Va.
Mrs. A. J. Montague, President. Miss
Ruby 'Bodeker, Mrs. A. J. Pyle,
Mrs. A. M. Reddy, Committee.
The Caucasian would urge its friends
everywhere to respond to the appeal.
Who could be more worthy and deserv
ing of your assistance? A mite will help
practically and substantially. It may be
asid that the ladies and the Home have
the endorsement of the Governor of
Virginia.
