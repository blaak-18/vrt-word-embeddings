Addressing an Armistice Day cele
bration flf members of the Ku Klux
Klan of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and
Indiana at Fort Wayne, Ind., Dr. H.
W. Evans, Imperial Wizard of At
lanta, Ga., pleaded that the day be
made an anniversary both of burial
and resurrection, the sepulchre of
war and the birthplace of peace.
He did not discuss the Klan or its
internal problems in his prepared
speech.
He detailed at length the cost of
the World War, both in men and
money, and added, “because it was
‘a war to end war,’ and ‘to make the
world safe for democracy/ we put
in more than we had to give.”
“Despite its holy purpose/ con
tinued Dr.* Evans, “the man power,
the armaments and the resources of
a combination of the mightiest na
tions proved powerless to bring
‘peace on earth, good will to men/
Today the world is virtually an
armed camp. There is no fighting,
only because whole purposes are too
exhausted, too impoverished to fight.
There is no sign of permanent peace.
Out of it have come no instrumental
ities, no institutions to make peace
possible. The great loss is that war
breeds war.”
“We must have a compulsory edu
cational system to reach and uplift
every future citizen,” he said. “It
must be publicly sponsored and paid
for, without a single parochial ex
ception. There should be a cabinet
department of education, second to
none in its public importance.”

POLITICAL HATS ARE IN THE AIR
Republicans Predict Nomination of Coolidge, While Demo-
crats Favor McAdoo and Senator Ralston,
Republicans Predict Nomination of
Coolidge, While Democrats Favor
* McAdoo and Senator Ralston
From present indications, the
League of Nations, World Court, re
duction of taxes, the soldiers’ bonus
and the Ku Klux Klan wil be the chief
issue in the presidential campaign of
1924. Republican party leaders are
confident that President Coolidge will
win the nomination and Democratic
leaders apparently favor McAdoo and
Senator Samuel M. Ralston, of In
diana. ,
Johnson Enters Fight
Senator Hiram yf . Johnson, of Cali
fornia, formerly entered the fight to
the Republican nomination last
week on the aflti-League of Nations
and anti-World Court platform. In a
statement to the public, Senator John
son announced that the United States
must not become embroiled in any
political tangles abroad and that the
foreign policy should be dictated by
the voters of the nation.
Senator Johnson’s announcement
increased the number of announced
presidential candidates to three.
Coolidge is'keeping silent on his can
didacy. Those that have thrown their
“hats in the ring,” in addition to Mr.
Asserting that “America means
home or it means nothing,” Dr.
Evans said that 90 per cent of the
aliens coming to this country since
the war “have neither our home
standards nor, in most' cases, the de
sire to attain them.”
“We cannot hope to succeed in any
supreme task for civilization without
a competent, consecrated citizenship.”
Johnson are William Gibbs McAdoo,
Woodrow Wilson’s son-in-law, and
Senator Oscar W. Underwood, of Ala
bama.’ The two latter candidates are
Democrats.
“Dark Horses” .
Other “potential candidates,” who
are “awaiting the call of the Demo
cratic party,” are Henry Ford, Sena
tor Ralston and James E. Cox, who
was defeated by the late President
Harding. Gov. Pinchot, of Pennsyl
vania, is another “dark horse,” who
secretly covets the Republican nomi
nation, but has made no formal an
nouncement as to his * candidacy.
Gov. A 1 Smith, Catholic, of New York,
has the Tammany Hall support for
the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Cox stands on s the same plat
form, which caused his defeat in 1920.
He is a League of Nations advocate to
the bitter end.
Senator Underwood opened his cam
paign two weeks ago in Texas with a
speech in which he' denounced mask
ed organizations. The Alabama Sen
ator was formerly a bitter ender for
the League, but since his return from
Europe he has modified his attitude
and is “on the fence” on this issue.
Favor Reduced Taxes
Mr. McAdoo’tf'announcement of his
candidacy followed a few days after
a conference in Washington with Mr.
Wilson. Mr. McAdoo has thus far
straddled the League of Nations ques
tion and has not committed himself.
In a recent statement, he said that the
taxes of the country must be reduced
and the soldiers’ bonus should be
passed.
At the present time, Mr. Ford’s
chances of securing the nomination
are very small, although he has a
large following in some sections of
the country.
Mr. Harding’s overwhelming elec
tion over Mr. Cox in the last cam
paign will go a long ways toward
keeping the “Cox boom” down. He
will be power at the National Con
vention, but will be like William
Jennings Bryan, one whose advise in
the selection of a nominee carries
great force, but whose personal can
didacy will be of negligible value.
Smith’s Chances Slim
Gov. Smith's repeal of the liquor en
forcement act of - New York State
will block his candidacy, althought he
will have a large wet following in the
first ballots at the convention. The
wet support will be split between A 1
Smith and Mr. Underwood, who vot
ed against the 18th A men< hnent, be*
cause of his belief in state’s rights.
Gov. -Smith is a member of the
Knights of Columbus and the infam
ous Tammany Hall crowd. Voicing
the sentiment of some of the ablest
Democrats in the country, Represen
tative William D. Upshaw, of Georg
ia, last week announced that Smith’s
candidacy and his wet platform would
be a pill that the solid South would
refuse to swallow, in the event the
Romanist secured the party nomina-
' The CALL OF THB NORTH
tion.
Smith’s wet platform has catised
a rift already in the Democratic
ranks of New York State.
The spectrb of the Ku Klux Klan
will invade the. political horizon, of
1924. Democratic women of New
York held a meeting in New York
City last week, at which Mrs. Julia
Wheelock, “Mother of the American
Legion,” warned ~the New Yorkers
that their favorite son, A 1 Smith,
could never be President, because the
Ku Klux Klan would prevent the elec
tion of any Catholic, with his divided
allegiance to the highest office of the
land.-
Klan landslide in the municipal
elections three weeks ago, which
swept all of the states that held “off
year” elections and put six staunch
Northern States in the allignment of
“Klan States,” has forced leaders of
both major parties to realize that the
Klan will be a great issue in ‘the
Presidential' elections.
" Party bosses at a conference at
French Lick Springs, Ind., last week
and the early part'of this week dis
cussed the Democratic campaign, rela
tive to the Klan.
Charles F. Murphy, Tammany Hall
boss, and Thomas Taggart, chief of
the Indiana Democratic forces, were
non-committal on their attitude
towards the patriotic organization,
but it was intimated that Mr. Taggart
was in favor of the party asking a def
inite stand on the question. George S.
Brennan, Chicago Democratic boss,
also attended the conference.
Recent public utterance of Senator
Ralston, who was elected by the Klan
forces, are taken as an indication of
the Mr. Taggart believes in
taking. There is little doubt that
Mr. Taggart and Senator Ralston
have come to an agreement in refer
ence to the Klan.
The conference is said ,to have end
ed in an agreement for an anti-Mc-
Adoo bloc. Brennan and Murphy are
“wets” and favor Smith’s candidacy,
while Mr. Taggart hopes to nominate
Senator Ralston, via the anti-McAdoo
bloc. Mr. Taggart insists that the
party cannot afford to nominate a
“wet” standard bearer.
The “anti-McAdoo bloc” conspiracy
is designed to place Underwood and
McAdoo into a deadlock, so bitter
that neither delegation will retire in
favor of the other. This will leave
both delegations ready to accept Sen
ator Ralston and the conspirators
hope to nominate the Indiana man
through-this “coupe de etat.”

TIVE MEMBERS *
Hoosiers Pat On Huge Celebration At
Fort Wayne; 15,000 Kluxers In
Parade; 1,200 Cincinnati
Kluxers Attend
—K-K-K
The best of Klandom of Indiana,
the visiting delegation from Michi
gan and Ohio gathered in Ft. Wayne
Saturday in* celebration of Armis
tice Day and to hear Dr. Hiram Wes
ley Evans, Imperial Wizard, and
other Klan officials.
The meeting at Fort Wayne was
primarily in celebration of attaining
the goal of 500,000 in Indiana. Fea
ture of the affair was the night pa
rade with over 15,000 in line, and
conservative estimates of newspaper
men of 75,000 spectators and visitors
from out of state and Indiana, 7,000
from Ohio and 15,000 from Michigan.
The feature that was unusual was
1,200 Klansmen with a 100-piece band
from Cincinnati, Ohio, who made the
long trip in a special train, only for
the privilege of participating in the
night parade. In his address, Dr.
Evans declared that, “on this occa
sion in celebration of Armistice Day,
that despite that holy purpose, the
manpower, the armaments and the
resources of a combination of the
mightiest nations on earth, all proved
powerless to bring peace on earth
and good will to men.” He declared:
“Today the world is virtually an
armed camp. There is no fighting
only because whole peoples are too
much exhausted, too terribly impov
erished, to fight. There is no sign
of permanent peace; out of it have
come no instrumentalities, no insti
tutions to make peace possible. There
is no thinking man or woman in all
Christendom who does not »realize
that further warfare would wreck the
world. Nor is it possible anywhere
to find rational human beings who
are not agreed, and determined, that
a saner, safer, surer, more Christian
way of ending war itself must be
found.” Declaring that the only an
swer is a “militant spirituality with
direct leadership, and that our own
American life is being gradually de
stroyed by the infiltrations of the
forces of hate, greed,” he emphasized
the problem of immigration, declar
ing that “this nation is our home,
that we built it, that we protected
it and that we should and ’did cherish
it beyond all possibilities.” Dr.
Evans declared that, “any immigrant,
to be desirable and to be an asset
to America, must come within an in
herent capacity for our kind of citi
zenship,” and emphasized the neces
sity for a Protestant, white, Ameri
can, Anglo-Saxon for the* spiritual
%nd political guidance of America and
the world.
Among others who made short
talks was Charles Q. Palmer, Grand
Dragon of Ohio, and D. C. Stephen
son, formerly Grand Dragon of In
diana, and lovingly referred to by
Indiana and Ohio Klansmen as “the
old man.” He decried the Federal
reserve system “as the organized be
trayal pf America,” and condemned
them for their inadequacy and fail
ure to render farm relief measures,
and urged support of the “battle of
American citizenship to secure oper
ative patriotism to drive selfishness,
greed and corrupt politics from the
high places as well as the low places
in American government.” He ad
vocated conservation of natural re
sources, government control of water
power and a return to the funda
mentals of the Constitution in all its
phases.

Klan Meeting

A large Klan meeting at Barnes
ville Tuesday evening was interrupt
ed by the appearance of the night
patrolman who bolted through the
door of the Creamery Hall where
Rev. Fink of Austin was discussing
the public school in a lecture on the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The
officer took the speaker By the arm
and asked the speaker to follow him
and told the audience that the meet
ing was -over. When asked by mem
bers of the audience as to the
charges, he stated that he didn’t
know but he said the mayor had or
dered him to stop the meeting and
arrest the speaker. The audience
then demanded of him to bring the
mayor to the hall which he did.
When the mayor was asked about the
charges, he stated that there were
none, but that he wanted the meet
ing broken up. The audience then
hooted the mayor and officer until
they left the hall and the meeting
continued.
After the meeting, the speaker pre
sented himself to the mayor’s place
of Business for arrest, but the mayor
said that their object was merely to
break up the meeting.'

ROMANS IN VETERANS’ BUREAU
CAUSED TRIAL OF PROTESTANT
K-K-K
« »
Papal Senator Caused Investigation and Secured Appoint
ment of Catholic as Prosecuting Council to Crusify Mason.
FELLOWSHIP FORUM NOT AFRAID OF FACTS.
Col. Charles R. Fobes, Mason, for
mer director of the United States
Veterans’ Bureau, is being crucified
on the black cross of Romanism, if
'certain events in the course of the
promulgation of the present investi
gation are to be taken as criterion.
The investigation, according to
those well on the inside of the affair,'
which has never yet been brought out
before the Senate committee, had its
inception at the American Legion
convention in New Orleans in 1922.
Forbes Defeated Roman
The New York state delegation,
made up largely of and dominated
altogether by Roman Catholics, went
to New Orleans with instructions
from the hierarchy that “Bill” Dee
gan was to be put over as command
er. With a great whoop and cry the
delegates from the Tiber raised the
cry that ‘ Old Bill Deegan,” whom
they sought by this appellation to
surround with a halo of veneration
and reverence, must be elected com
mander. They sought to stampede
ths convention and sweep Deegan
info office in the excitement of their
demonstration for him.
Col. Forbes, attending the conven
tion, *§fcw the course things were tak
ing, and knowing Deegan’s connec
tion and his record, rose on the floor
and call attention to a theretofore
unknown fact—that Deegan was not
an overseas man. That finished Dee
gan. Owsley, an overseas man, was
chosen, and the Catholics were forced
to come away with the second best
office—that of chaplain.
Roman Conspiracy
Then it was that the Catholic edict
went forth that Forbes must be got
en. All efforts of the Roman Cath
olic hierarchy, who§e ramifications ex
tended into all parts of the Veterans’
Bureau, were put into force to bring
out everything it possibly could to
discredit the Forbes administration.
A reporter for the Washington Her
ald, a Hearst newspaper, John A.
Kennedy Catholic, was working daily
in the Veterans’ Bureau gathering
news. The word was passed through
the Romanist organization permeat
ing the establishment to feed this re
porter with all the stories that could
be found tending to show that Forbes
was crooked. This one man turned
up more “evidence” against Forbes
than any six men of his mediocre
ability could procure without the aid
of some vast and well-working ma
chine behind him.
Flynn Behind Plot
Then he, with his managing editor,
M. J. Flynn, also a Catholic, went to
New York for a personal interview
with William ' Randolph Hearst, to
induce him to throw the whole Hearst
machine in Washington into the fray
to cause a gigantic expose of Forbes
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
But Mr. Hearst evidently saw the
ruse, and exercising one of those in
denepdent streaks of his, he refused
to have anything to do with it, hold
ing that it was a matter purely local
to Washington. However, he grant
ed Flynn and Kennedy permission to
pursue their “expose” in the Herald
as they had been doing.
In the meantime the Catholic roar
had reached the United States Sen
ate, where David I. Walsh of Massa
chusetts,*' a Catholic, introduced the
resolution which provides for the
committee that is now investigating
the Forbes affair. Walsh firmly ex
pected to be made chairman of the
committee, but for same inexplicable
reason the then Vice President. Coo
lidge appointed Senator David A.
Reed of Pennsylvania, Mason, as the
chairman of the committee.
Catholic Prosecutor
Thus curbed, Walsh was forced to
content himself with working in Maj.
Gen. James F. O’Ryan of New York,
Catholic as counsel for the commit
tee. That O’Ryan has done yeoman
service for the hierarchy in this ap
pointment is evident.
This article is not written in ex
tenuation of any wrongs that Col.
Forbes may have committed, but is
for the purpose of showing to the
people of the country some of the
things that have taken place behind
the scenes of which it is not aware
and which, for some reason, have not
been broughtout in the investigation.
To date nothing of a “graft” or
criminal nature has been proved oil
him. His principal accuser is Elias
H. Mortimer of Philadelphia, who
admitted he became acquainted with

Address THE RAIL SPLITTER, Milan, DL
Col. Forbes through a desire to get
some rich government contracts for
his friends and to obtain rich graft
“pickings,” and because he was frus
trated in this design he turned on
Forbes like an ungrateful cur and is
snarling at his heels.
Mortimer, according to the evi
dence, brought his wife to Washing
ton as a pawn in the scheme to play
her to Forbes and through her get
the contracts he sought.
The entire case has been surround
ed with 'the usual Catholic smoke
screen, and the main issue has been
lost in the haze. Forbes was ac
cused of dishonesty and graft, and all
that has been proved against him is
that, in a measure, he “fell” for the
wiles of a pretty woman.
Col. Forbes’ enemies were called
and recalled to the stand and made
various charges reflecting upon the
colonel. Their testimony was not
limited in any way, and on some oc
casions when Col. Forbes or his at
torneys would “pass the lie” or ob
ject to'testimony of witnesses as un
fair or incorrect the defense was im
mediately- warned by the court of in
quiry to cease display of emotions.
Although the prosecution was not
handicapped in any manner, the de
fense was informed Monday that “the
committee had decided not to hear
any furtherwitnesses in defense of
Col. Forbes for lack of time.” The
defense immediately protested this
decision, but the committee’s ruling
was not changed. James S. Easby
Smith, counsel for Mr. Forbes, then
notified the court that this ruling had
prevented the defense from present
ing “a full and adequate defense.”
