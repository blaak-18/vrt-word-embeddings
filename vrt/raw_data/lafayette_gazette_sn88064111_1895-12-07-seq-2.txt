the recent bolt andt be is-In hopes
that party division in this' parish
, .ll give the nigger s chance to
3e, but the duski- politician
Swho `clainms - be a- "Republican
leader from Lafayette parish"-needs
entertain no such hope. The white
, people of this parish know that the
n safest way to keep the coons out is
k to remain united, and this they pro
pose to do, bolt or no bolt. They
know what a split among the Demo
crats will .inevitably entail, and
,. knowing that as well as they do,
Sthey will' t'ur out on the a4th of
December and nominate their can
didates, who will doubtless be
elected at the general election, as
- the parish is overwhelmingly Demo
cratic. In this way they will crush
the last, lingering hope which may
yet spring in the breast of the once
mighty Paddio. Some years ago
'lPaddio sunk into what Mr.
J Cleveland would term "innocuous
e desuetude" and his unexpected ap
pearance at this stage of the game
may be the forerunner of the pro
verbial nigger in the wood-pile.
SWe note in the interview that Pad
dio says that "Lafayette has orga- 1
nized as a unit." This timely
warning from so influential and in
Stelligent a negro as Paddio should
set the white Democrats of this par
ish to thinking. Let them bear in
mind that division is dangerous and
in unity lies safety. Let them re
member that by standing together 1
they will exterminate the last ghastly
remnants of Paddioism in Lafayette.
In the mean time it might be well
for Paddio and his motley gang to
take notice that the white people of
this parish don't intend to put up
with their nasty politics any more.
RED RICE.
The New Orleans papers are
devoting a considerable amount 1
of space to the subject ofa
red rice, or Creole rice.
Much is being said about the I
alleged inferior qiuality of this rice, I
and in this way great injury is done i
this industry. Red rice is getting 1
to be regarded by strangers as un- I
clean and very undesirable food,
when it is a well-known fact that
the contrary is the truth, for it is
undeniably true that red rice is
good, nutritious, palatable food.
Those who have used it can bear
testimony to this statement. Speak- r
ing of this matter, the New York
rice millers, Dan Talmage's Sons, i
write the following to a Louisiana
planter:
"We cannot see why the New
Orleans people are so down upon i
and decry red rice. As a result of
the light esteem in which such is I
held by New Orleans, it fails to rea
lize any decent figure. We can
hardly suppose our milling facilities a
in New York are superior to their's
and yet, we find our output of this
character sells just as easily as the
white and at fairly relative figures,
considering the bad name which the
New Orleans people have given it.
We claim that the Creole rice, i. e.
red rice, is the best rice in the
world, not simply just as good as s
the whiter sorts; nor again, that its I
relative cheapness should impel cus
tomers from enonomic motives to Il
give it their preference, but taking
a broad and correct ground, that it 1i
is intrinsically the best rice and its
unpopularity a confession of igno-.
rance. The intrinsic value of any
bread-stuff should be estimated by I
its nutritions properties and an d
analysis some years ago by the govy
ernment chemist at Washington de
monstrated that Creole or red rice
of Louisiana was far and away
ahead of white rice, domestic or a
foreign." '
The Populists and Republicans t'
held a joint caucus at Alezandsia t<
Tuesday last. The Pops will neomi
nate ~a State ticket on January 8, at
Alexandria. Later on the Republi- s
cans will hold a convention, and s
probabilities are that they will en
dorse the Populist ticket. Both C
parties will oppose the amendment. '

tilo learly and thoroughly to the
voters. The attndance was Targe
Sever 'neetinsg, showinse :.4 the
Democrats of the parish have taken
the correct viewr dithe recent bolt;
A bfullk,.ot. will be polled on the
1 4th and i is sale to say that the
candidates omiinated on that day
by the piraaries will have a walk
over at the general election in
April. The action of the bolters is
severely denounced by the Demo'
crate throughout the parish.
The bolters -have ordered prima
rIes on Wednesday, the zsth of
December, to send delegates to the
nominating convention at Shreve
port. The Gazette certainly has no
objection to the gentlemen making
a trip to Shreveport.. On the con
trary it can but do them good.
There they will be afforded an op
portunity to learn some things
which may be of use to them in the
future. They will be showr that
minorities don't rule in meetings or
conventions. They seem to be ig
norant of this fact and we sincerely
hope that while at the convention
they will make it their especial mis
sion to ascertain that majorities rule.j
and that minorities can have their
opinions, but that there is no law to
compel the majorities to entertain
the same opinions. As our friends,
the bolters, know very well that
their action is so clearly undemo
cratic, rebellious and arbitrary, they
will not have the slightest chance of
being seated; however a little trip
to Shreveport won't hurt them and
we are glad to see them go. We
would advise the-m to take "Jim
Coon" along to make the presenta
tion of their case. He is such a lu
minous writer, a powerful reasoner,
and he is so funny, that should he
be pursuaded upon to deliver one of
his characteristic addresses there is
no telling what might happen-he
may be put on the ticket against his
will-for we all know he is no poli
tician and does not want office. By
all means, the bolters should see
that "'Jim Coon" is a delegate.
The Gazette is really surprised and I
somewhat pained to see so intelli- I
gent a gentleman as "Jim Coon"
allign himself with the rump De
mocracy of this parish. If we are i
not mistaken "'Jim Coon" is more
of a "'fox" than a "coon," though
in his recent actions he has not dis
played a superior quality of "foxi
ness."
The negroes are demanding that
the Republican House of Repre
sentatives choose a negro chaplain
to mediate between that wicked
body and the throne of grace. We
trust our Republican brethren will
not' slight this opportunity to give
the negro parson a chance. It has
been demonstrated that the Caucas
ian prayer is a rank failure so far as
its power to affect the walk and con
versation of a Republican Congress
is concerned. We all remember
that in the Reed Congress hell broke
loose in the house every morning
before the chaplain's heaven-direct
ed petition had ceased to reverber
ate. The men who have been do
ing the praying for congress give too
much thought to Addisonian style
and elegance of composition. They
are too literary and grammatical.
Their prayers lack body; they lack
emotion, fervor and directness.
They are stiff-starched, close-but
toned, high-collared affairs and
seem to be always on dress parade
before the Lord. Give congress an
old-fashioned negro exhorter, and
let its sins go up to heaven on the
wings of one of those weird, wail
ling, half-sung, half-shotuted peti
tions that make the stiffest neck to
bow, the hardest heart to melt and
lashes into agonizing activity the
dullest conscience. - Commercial
AppeaL
It is stating a simple fact when
we say that a visitor cannot help
being highly impressed with the ex
tensive and attractive collection of
toys and holiday goods on display
at the popular store of Moss Bros.
& Co. Even a casual observer is
soon convinced of the fact that the
stock embraces the latest novelties
and that the assortment is one cal
culated to meet taste, means and
preferences of every iadividual like
ly to enter the store. Moss Bros.
& Co. seem to be determined to
make a notable feature of the gift
giving, holiday-shopping period and
if standard merit and extensive va
siety go for anything, they will score -
a record for the present season that
will see their old customers better ;

Chamberlain's ;Cough Remedy. It
possesses- some.: medical properties
that relieve the little sufferers im

the best cough medicine in the

given as soon as the croupy cough
appears it will prevent the attack.
It is also an ide.il remedy for whoop

giving it to children, as it contains
nothing injurious. For sale by all
