ATTENTION KLANSMEN!
Loyalty to MOVEMENT Rather than Personalities is
our OBLIGATION as KLANSMEN.
In the near future you will receive information concerning some definite changes in the MINNESOTA
KLAN ADMINISTRATION. The Editor of the Call of the North, P. J. Orn, has thoroughly informed himself
on all details pertaining to the changes and is ABSOLUTELY satisfied that they are for the good of the move
ment. Rest assured that P. J. Orn would oppose any change which would injure Minnesota Klandom. The
recent changes should be acceptable to.all real Klansmen in that the Imperial Wizard is now directly in
charge of the Minnesota Realm, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan through his representative.

AN OPEN CHALLENGE
The favorite weapon of the news
papers spreading propaganda to in
jure and destroy the Ku Klux Klan is
to publish front page articles with
scarce heads reading usually, “Hooded
Horrors,” “Masked Outrages,” “Hood
ed Klan Commits Crimes,” etc., all
of which you have read so many times
it needs no repetition. This is spread
ing poison for those who do not look
beneath the surface, to eat. It is the
method employed by the cause that
desires to destroy something that
bars them from possession of a co
veted object: This wave of propa
ganda has been steadily increasing in
the past few months, by a press,
which we have repeatedly stated was
subsidized. Starting with the Mer
Rouge incident in Louisiana, which at
this late day, they have been compell
ed to admit was the greatest fiasco
of the age. The pathologists just a
few weeks ago stated under their sig
nature that it would have been im
possible for the bodies, used to estab
lish proof of a purported and un
proved murder, to have remained in
the waters of Lake La Fourche, forty
eight hours, and been in the condition
as presented to them. Yet the Com
mercial Appeal informed you that it*
was the bodies and asserted they had
been in the waters four months.
We hereby issue the following chal
lenger to Mr. Mooney, the Catholic
who edits the supposedly protestant
Commercial Appeal, or to any Priest
or Prelate in Memphis or Tennessee
or any layman, who will come out in
the open and not hide behind dirty,
filthy unsigned letters, that for every
outrage, atrocity, or act contrary to
law, proved of unproven, charged
against the Klan or Klansmen, we
agreeing to publish the list, we will
submit proven charges against mem-
$5,000 PAID FOR PARDON BY
WALTON
Oklahoma City, Okla. —A broken
down old man bowed with the sor
rows of a wayward son was put on
the witness stand in the Walton im
peachment trial recently and told of
buying a pardon for $5,000 for Virgil
Hollingshead of Perry, Okla. /r
The witness was J. D. Hollings
head, a farmer, father of the youth
who was freed from the penitentiary
on a pardon signed by the governor.
The elder Hollingshead told of how
he was approached by L. S. Flannery,
Ponca City lawyer, and asked for
the sum in question for the purpose
of obtaining the desired pardon.
“I did not want to give $5,000,"
said the old man, “because I would
have to go out and borrow the
money."

We further agree that we will not
consult Fox’s Book of Martyrs, Gib
bons Rome, Guizot’s France, or to
bring in the Massacre of St. Bathoie

the tens of thousand burned alive, the

similar to the murder of Rev. Black,
who was fouly shot to death in his

by members of .the Knights of Colum

any Priest, Prelate, or layman to in

KLAN ASKS FOR BIBLE
BEADING IN SCHOOL
Yale, Mich.—Upon opening a pack
age received by him from the Ku
Klux Klan, the secretary of the
Board of Education here found that
it contained 16 Bibles and a note ask
ing that they be taken to the Yale
public schools and distributed among
the teachers, with the request that a
portion be read to the pupils each
day.
Alien propaganda, which preaches
that the Klan is a “lawless tribe,”
has taken a decided downward trend

MISSOURI, KANSAS, NEBRASKA SHOW
PATRIOTISM BY KLAN ALIGNMENT
Klansmen From Many States Disclose Con
structive Programs and Increasing Member
ship in Great Organization.
Emporia, Kan.—Kansas has gone
Ku Klux and her sister states, Mis
souri and Nebraska are keeping her
close company. " .
The fact was demonstrated last
week when Klansmen from through
out the state asembled here in con
ference with high officials of the In
visible Empire and leaders in Klan
dom from throughout the United
States.
While the meeting was confined to
official representatives from Kansas,
reports from both Missouri and Ne
braska, which, with, this state,'com
prise the territory of George C. Mc-
Carron, Imperial Representative,
showed that the spirit of Klankraft
is just as rampant in those common
wealths a 3 it is here.
The meeting here lasted two days
with special religious services Sun
day, November 18. It was unique in
that there were present the .Imperial
Wizard, Dr. Hiram Wesley Evans,
and his aides, in addition to Imperial
Representative McCar'ron, eight Grand
Dr&gona. They were: Charles G.
Palmer, Illinois; Fred L. Gifford,
Oregon; N. C. Jewett, Oklahoma; N.
B. Forrest, Georgia; J. C. Comer, Ar
kansas; James Esdale, Alabama, and
Grand Dragon Johnson of Wyoming.
Splendid tribute were paid to the
efforts of Mr. McCarron in organiz
ing the best citizenship of this and
the two sister states under the fiery
cross.
Exalted Cyclops and other repre
sentatives from every Klan in the
state reported the progress, of their
organization work and •'Outlined the
constructive programs that they have
already carried out and are now un
dertaking. ~
In order that the great work might
go on uninterruptedly a resolution
was unanimously adopted authorizing
the Imperial Representative to peti
tion Imperial Headquarters for the
banishment of Col. Wm. Joseph Sim
mons, who has attempted to secure
control of the organization for "elfish
purposes.
Another feature of the program
was an address by Mrs. McCarron,
who heads the Women of the Ku
Klux Klan in Kansas. Her recital
of activities and plans of the women
was a revelation and proved most in
spirational.
Klansmen from all sections report
ed that there was an increasing inter
est in the organization and that the
public was rapidly realizing that the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is the
one great organization that is striv
ing to maintain those fundamental
principles upon which the nation was
founded.
Reports were received of aid to
measures benefiting the public
schools; co-operation with local offi
ceija in the enforcement of the law,
particularly those statutes covering
the 18th amendment; activity in pol
itics that had for y its purpose the
election of upright, honest and effi
cient municipal, county and state offi
cials.
Speakers outlined the national pol
icies of the organization with rela
tion to immigration, the separation of
chruch and state,' and the preserva
tion of the public school system.
Each of the Grand Dragons and other
officials had instructive, interesting
and .inspirational places on the pro
gram.
Grand Dragon Forrest of Georgia,
who is a grandson of Gen. Nathan
Bedford Forrest, Grand Wizard of
the original Ku Klux whose head
quarters are in Atlanta, described
conditions at the Imeprial Palace and
paid a high tribute to the efficient

business administration there.
Grand Dragon Johnson, a member
of the national finance committee,
told of the Klan’s splendid financial
condition and gave facts and figures
of intense value and interest.
A most helpul feature was a dem
onstration of Klan work. •
One of the most enjoyable ad
dresses was that made by Charles G.
Palmer, Grand Dragon of Illinois.
Praise for McCarron
After pleasant introductory, re
plete with mirth-provoking inuendos
inspired by the Imperial Represent
ative’s good looks and “taking ways
with the ladies,” in which the charm
ing Mrs. Palmer, of distinguished
American Protestant stock for many
generations, came in for some of the
bantering, Mr. Palmer launched into
an eloquent dissertation upon the re
sponsibilities of Klansmen.
Commenting upon the fact that No
vember 19 was the 60th anniversary
of the delivery of Lincoln’s Gettys
burg address, the Grand Dragon said:
“Less than three score years ago
our fathers brought forth in these
United States a. new movement con
ceived with Divine intuition and ded
icated to the Sublime principles and
lofty' ideals of perpetuating our na
tion.
“Now we are engaged in a great
crusade, testing whether that move
ment so conceived and so dedicated
shall be effective. We are face to
face with a great crisis. We have
come to a crucial time in the history
of our fundamental institutions and
heritage must be safeguarded. We
have met today as leaders in that
great movement to intensify our ac
tivities in and about carrying on the
great "crusade. It is imperative that
we should do this.
“And in a larger respon
sibilities as citizens demand that we
should reconsecrate ourselves to the
fulfillment of those sublime principles
and ideals. We are Klansmen. The
faithful and valiant Klansmen of the
reconstruction days, who founded .this
movement, created the very bulwark
of our nation’s safety. Some may
little understand what they did then,
but the alien who would destroy ms
cannot forget them. And it is for
us modern Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan to reincarnate the spirit of
those early Klansmen and work out
the sublime principles and ideals in
Klankraft that they so valiantly
fought .for. They were not specula
tive Klansmen. They actually fought
for the right.
“We must be operative Klansmen.
We will not take the law into our
owti hands, for we are law-abiding
citizens. Yet will see to it that
our great institution shall continue
to make vital its spiritual purposes;
achieve its laudable objects, and at
tain its lofty ideals. We rededicate
ourselves to insure unity of organiza
tion, and guarantee an effective form
of government, and pledge our voice,
our loyalty, our manhood and our sa
cred honor to enforce the same—that
jifstice and honor may be done the
sacred memory of those who wrought
throughout mystic ; society during
that early peyod, and that their va
liant accomplishments be not lost to
posterity; that this nation under God
shall have ja new birth of freedom,
and that government of the people,
by the people and for the people of
our kind shall not perish from the
earth."

WANT SOME JUSTICE FOR RICH
ANO POOR VIOLATORS OF LAW
Valparaiso, Ind.—When two of this
city’s best known citizens were ar
rested for drunkenness following the
Armistice day celebration here Mon
day, November 12, the best element
in the community was disgusted, but
not surprised. The surprise came
when the two Worthies were reported
to have resorted to the O’Donnellian
name substitution trick to conceal
their identities. The characters in
this “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”
drama are alleged to be Grant Crum
packer, well known attorney and
sometimes special judge, and Leßoy
M. Pierce, wealthy insurance broker.
Members of the Charles Pratt post
of the American Legion, who with the
merchants of this city, staged the
splendid Armistice day program, with
other good citizens of the city, are
taking a keen interest in the “Jekyll-
Hyde” case. They point out that Sam
Richards, a ditch digger, was arrest
ed on the same day for the same of
fense as that for which Crumpacker
and Pierce were taken into custody,
.and that he was fined $25.60.
The attorney and the broker were
arrested at Gooley’is establishment,
taken to the jail and given a “talking
to” by the chief of police, and order
ed home. Crumpacker didn’t want to
go home. He went back to Gooley’s.
Citizens who felt that the law
should be no respecter of persons and
that if the ditch digger wag fined the
lawyer and the broker should also
pay the penalty, made representations
to the police department which result
ed in charges being filed against
them.
. The affidavits upon which the com
plaints were issued, charged Grant
Crumpacker and Leßoy M. Pierce
with being “drunk and disorderly.”
When these affidavits were return
ed to the court of Justice of the
Peace Louderbeck, it was discovered
that the names of Crumpacker and
Pierce had been erased from them
and the aliases “Gordon Morgan” and
“George Doe” substituted.
A complaint against William Goo
ley, proprietor of the resort where
the local “highlights were arrested,
was-filed and later returned under the
alias “Harry Smith.”
_ It is alleged that the Prosecuting
Attorney instructed Justice of the
Peace Louderbeck not to issue war
rants for the three men, as he said
they would voluntarily appear in per
son for hearing Wednesday afternoon
at 3:00 o’clock.- They did not appear.
The warrants were issued by the
Justice of the Peace was advised By
the Prosecuting Attorney that if they
were served the charges would be
nolle prossed.
Disregarding this advise, Justice
Louderbeck, through a constable, at
tempted to serve the warrants Thurs
day, November 14, and finally suc
ceeded, though the names on the iri*-
struments were the aliases adopted
ostensibly to prevent justice for
prominent citizens” to take the same
form it had assumed in the case of
a poor ditch digger.
The final charpter in Valparaiso’s
“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” case was
to be written Wednesday, November
22, when Crumpacker, alias “Gordon
Morgan,” Pierce, Alias “George Doe,”
and Gooley, alies “Harry Smith,”
were to be tried before Justice Loud
erbeck and this city was to learn
whether there are different laws for
the rich and the poor.
