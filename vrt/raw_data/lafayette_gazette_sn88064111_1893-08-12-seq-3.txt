WH Y?
Why do y2u persist in paying ONE DOLLAR for a thing youean buy)
at from 75 to 85 cents ?
Don't you know that a penny SAVED, is a penny EARNED -If
you know anything, you know that the easiest way to MAKE money is to S
SAVE money.
If our prices are from 15 to 25 per cent LOWER than those "you
usually pay for the cot:umodities of life, then it is clear that you can save
just that much on the cost ot living by trading with us.
We assert that we save the people who trade with us, year In and
year out, from z5 to 25 cents on every dollar they spend, and for the
truthfulness of this statement we refer to numerous customers living in
every part of the town and parish.
Those who cannot speak from personal experience are invited to give
us a fair trial and as long as they DON'T, why they will continue paying
$x.oo for wl.at they can buy at from 75 to 85 cents.
