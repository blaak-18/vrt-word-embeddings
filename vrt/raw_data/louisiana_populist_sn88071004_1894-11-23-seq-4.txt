will hear attentive consideration,
is republished in full. Two issues
of bonds in less than one year, in

is to restore the gold reserve,
which, when again reduced from
its proper proportions, will neces
sitate a third and possibly a fourth,
if not indefinite issues, unless Con

Many people in the United
States are disposed to abuse the
banks and the money sharks for
nthe issue of bonds. The national
banks and money lenders are sim

portunity offered them through a
inancial policy based on a gold
atandard, which is favored by mon

standard maintained. Utnfortu
