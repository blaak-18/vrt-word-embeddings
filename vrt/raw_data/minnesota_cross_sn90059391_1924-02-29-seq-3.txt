The Ku Klux Klan, whatever its
faults, has one quality much praised
by moralists. It gets action, wasting
no time in vain debate. In fact
there Is reason to believe that this
admirable trait Is the chief reason
for the tremendous hostility it has
aroused. Most of us endure very
Calmly all sorts of opinions or pro
jects so long as they remain safely
elocutionary. It Is when the Ideas
come to life and bite some one that
loud anathemas arise. The Klan cer
tainly gets this much tribute from
Its enemies.
Hie effect which the Klan pro
duces on the community Is the final
test of the power and success of the
whole movement, and to a large ex
tent of Its justification. Its whole
purpose is to produce action; it
makes almost no attempt to spread
ideas outside its own actual or pros
pective members; its internal dis
cussions are no disputations over
theory Often it cannot even state
its own case clearly. Everything is
aimed toward the single purpose of
changing our community and nation
al life; for this the Klan has built
up its autocratic generalship, its
solidly welded unity, its secrecy, its
terrorism and its intense emotional
ism. And because of all this heaped
up power and this singleness of pur
pose, the Impact when the Klan does
strike Is terrific even though It is
often Invisible.
In its actual methods of reforming
society, as well as in the general
system and strategy described in the
previous article, the Klan is seldom
seen and never heard. It is often,
Cerhaps usually, impossible even to
now for certain that it is the Klan
that acted, no matter how evident
the results may be. The thing is
done —that is all that can be known
in any case. It is a heavy hand that
strikes, yet it is as if a spectre held
the weapon or directed the blow.

can the methods by which the Klan
acts be fairly clearly traced.
It should be understood that nei
ther these methods nor most of the
instances given in this article can
be definitely proven to have any con
nection with the Klan. It is too
well concealed; thus this report is
based on “general information and
belief.” But because so many simi
lar situations appear wherever the
Klan exists and seldom appear else
where, the connection between the
two must be assumed, even if it can
not be proved.
The means by which the Klan act*
are ordinary enough In life both in
America and elsewhere; most organi
zations and most persons use them
constantly. They are deadly In the
Kina's hands merely because of the
power und skill with which It uses
them —like lfavld and his sling.
There is, for example, the feeling
of a lurking menace which the Klan
always manages to create in the
popular mind. There is doubtless a
menace, but the Klan “bluffs” the
public far beyond its real strength
or its real ruthlessness, just as we
all try more or less to make those
with whom we deal feel that we are
a bit stronger or a bit more deter
mined than we actually are. The
Klan “works its bluff” to perfection.
The ordinary citizen comes to be
lieve that it is a cruel and deter
mined monster of unknowable
strength, working by diabolic meth
ods through invisible agents, guided
by infernal acumen and able to
hurt him through every means that
a man dreads. Since so much is
unknown, his fears are always exag
gerated.
There may not be, and in most
Klan towns there never lias been, any
actual demonstration of force. But
unless they are themselves attacked
men do not care to become involved
in a trouble they cannot measure.
This holds the bulk of any commun
ity neutral and leaves those whom
the Klan does attack unsupported
and undefended. Klan officials deny
that they try to terrify people; I
cannot say that they do, but this
condition of being “bluffed to a
standstill” is the first fact to be
noted in any Klan community, and
so far as my experience goes is never
missing.
This fear of the Klan is often *
effective that no further weapon is
called for; a decree has only to be is
sued to be obeyed. Probably a great
many decrees which never come
from the Klan are also issued and
obeyed. But when there is resis
tance the Klan applies with scienti
fic precision either social ostracism
or a boycott or both. After a single
demonstration of these there is sel
dom need of further direct action,
and usually none is taken unless for
definite punishment or to drive some
person from the place. •
Let me hasten to say that I am
not accusing the Klan of illegal con
spiracy In these measures. There is
no order to Klansmen to ostracize or
stop tarding with the obnoxious per
sons; information is simply given
that these persons are obnoxious.
The distinction may seem small, but
I believe this method has been de
clared* legal in various cases where
labor boycotts were involved. Klans
men are free to act on this informa
tion or not as they choose, but they
all seem to choose to act. Let me
quote Dr. Evans on this:
“I know of no case where speakers
have advocated and pronounced offi
cial boycott. Where called to my at
tention and information is furnished,
they will be summarily removed. It
is contrary to law and in violation
of the principles of the Klan. This
refers to a specifically defined illi
gal boycott.
“As to the conferring or withhold
ing of patronage by Klansmen be
cause of various attitudes of busi
ness or professional men, that is a
very different matter. Vocational
Klannishness —in other words the
gractice of doing business with other
’lansmen —Is a tencnt of the Klan
as of every other fraternity, Includ
ing the Rotary club and the Klwanls
club, which specifically means ‘we
trade.’ It is to be expected that in
cases where people are hostile to the
Klan or are guilty of un-American
practices or of serious misconduct,
Klansmen will withhold patronage
as individuals. It is become gener
ally known that certain firms, for
example, have discharged employees
for no other reason than that they
were Klansmen. it would naturally
react against that firm with other
Klansmen. It Is also natural that
Klansmen and sometimes local Klans
huvlng Information of this kind
should disseminate It. Rut a Klans
man Is always free to act as he
pleases on such Information.”
The first move of a Klan when It
starts to clean up a town seems to be
among Its own members. It makes
them behave; several have complain
ed to me that since joining they
were no longer allowed to drluk! The
Klan has rules of conduct and a sys
tem of trial and punishment Inside
Itself which are most effective. Nor
are the crimes it punishes only
those against fellow members. There
Is little doubt that the level of con
duct Is raised among men who join.
The second move is against out
siders, usually against men or wom
en who have offended against the
Klan’s moral ideas. These are rather
strict being set by the same literal
minded, church-going class of de
cent people who have given us pro
hibition, demand strict observance
of the Sabbath, and have no sym
pathy for any sexual indulgences. Of
ten the victims are Catholics, Jews
and aliens, but I have learned of no
case in which there was not some de
finite charge of misconduct against
them, as well as the general fact of
their faith or race.
Bootleggers seem to be the favor
ite objects of attack; the Klan cru
sade against them at Herrin, 111., has
been widely advertised and has been
imitated in hundreds of towns. I find
that in some dozen places from
which I have information the price
of liquor—the best gauge of law en
forcement —has risen from two to
five hundred per cent since the Klan
took hold. Dope peddlers came in
for attention, social vice is censored,
grafting officials are taken care of,
places of amusement regulated, un
fair business dealing punished. But
there is also much effort put into
regulating .personal conduct. I have
-tories of Klan influence being
brought to bear on men who main
tained illicit relations with women,
who failed to support their families,
drank or gambled too heavily, or in
general “acted scandalously.”
With most of these a warning,
backed by their own fear of the
Klan, brings prompt reformation.
When this fails pressure is applied,
running through ostracism and boy
cott up to measures which drive the
culprit into exile in extreme cases.
The whole procedure can be illus
trated by a single case, which is ty
pical in that even the victim himself
does not know certainly that his en
emy is the Klan. It occurred a few
weeks ago in an eastern state in one
of those communities where the ori
ginal inhabitants have inbred, fall
en rather low, and dropped much
pretense of morality. The reformers
seem to be new-comers, backed by a
few of the better breed of old resi
dents.
In the town which is the center
o fthis community a young man who
is steady hard working and fairly
trustworthy, was living with a notor
iously vicious woman. He was call
ed to the ’phone one evening and ad
vised to leave her The speaker ar
gued at some length, explained that
the example was bad. made the pro
per bringing up of children harder,
and so forth. A week was allowed for
action. At the end of that time a
second brief warning was given that
he would regret it if he was not rid
of the woman in three days.
He kept her. On the fourth day
he lost his job. for plausible reasons.
The next day his landlord demanded
an exhorbitant raise in rent, for
plausible reasons. He found that
supplies were cut off. The milkman
disappeared. The butcher’s wagon
failed to stop, and when he went to
the stores he could get little atten
tion. At some he was flatlv told that
his trade was not wanted. By the end
of the week only one man would sell
him food and this grocer—who had
defied a telephone warning—was
brought into line within the next
week by the loss of nearly 70 per
cent of his trade.
The fight—if it can be called that
—was over inside of two weeks. The
young man moved to a hovel some
miles into the country, where
friends were at hand. As this is
written he is still out of work, liv
ing precariously on his friends’ char
ity. Such further orders as have
come over the telephones of that
town have been instantly obeyed.
As an example of the use of the
boycott in punishment, let me sub
mit a list read at a meeting of the
Klan in northern Ohio. It is writ
ten from memory and incomplete,
bu* nearly enough exact to do for
illustration. The speaker made no
recommendation of action. He said,
in effect:
“I wish to tell you some of the
thing* your fellow townsmen have

half-cotton goods as pure wool. Ar

drug store will give you the white

so on. It was an amazingly inclusive
list and on its face showed neither
race nor religious persecution. [Clans
men there boast that more than
sixty men and firms have been put
out of business in that town for rea
sons like this. It seems to work, for

THE FIERY CROSS
Simple Tombstone Marks Graves of Parents

STONE AT HEAD OF LI?
Vandals and souvenir hunters had
so chipped and marred the grave
stone at the head of the burial place
of Abraham Lincoln’s father and step
mother at Janesville, Illinois, that
had to wait an hour to be served at
other restaurants.
It should be noted that in cases
like these the effective strength of
the boycott is far greater than the
Klan membership. This is due to the
spread of information—or rumors —
about the man under attack which
bring in the support of many out
siders. These may be mere back
fence gossip, but they are more like
ly the development of “whispering
campaigns” to a fine art.
A final means by the Klan in its
clean-up is the laying of informa
tion before the regular law officers,
and bringing pressure to bear on
them. This Is the only means offi
cially sanctioned by the Klan of af
fecting conduct, and is being used
Increasingly. Hie fund of Informa
tion tlie Klan gathers makes it ex
tremely effective, both In Inducing
the officers to act and In providing
evidence for them to act on. It Is
wholly commendable.
In some parts of the country
there is a strong belief that even
‘hough night-riding has stopped, the
Klan still murders men. Since no
case of the kind lias ever been prov
ed. it is added that if the man de
tailed as executioner is ever brought
to trial, the Klan through its influ
>nce with law officers and jury sees
that he is acquitted. I cannot do
more than report this belief. These
rumors are to be expected in any
section where shooting is common
and are current concerning any pow
erful organization there. Possibly
they are sometimes true, though I
have never heard of one being prov
ed. If any Klan has been guilty it
has been perfectly successful in es
caping justice. But if the charges
are true they affect only about
a quarter of the present Klan.
for In the territory where tbe bulk
of Its strength new lies I have not
found even a whisper of violence.
The question of how much legal
officers favor Klansmen in places
where the organization is strong is,
however, a serious and universal one.
Most people believe that there is
little chance of a Klansman ever be
ing brought to justice. Hih belief
lias somewhat weakened since Philip
Pox was convicted of murder in At
lanta; Incldently tlie growth of the
Klan jumped after this happened.
The opponents who had confidently
predicted that he would be feez'd and
find emphasized the control the Klan
was supposed to have over Georgia
courts found themselves caught in
their own argument. My own opin
ion—l have met Fox ami mnst admit
a liking for him —Is that the Klan
does not control the Georgia courts
and also that It made no effort to
have Psx freed. But merely to see
that he was fairly tried. I do know
that his friends hoped he would be
found Insane a plea frequent
enough outside Klan circles.
Dr. Evans declares that the Klan
does not try nor wish to control or
influence any court. The Klansmnn’s
oath, he said, will not prevent his
telling the truth about his member
ship in the Klan or anythinig else.
To think that a judge would be influ
enced by fear of the Klan would be
an indictment of that official, he
says, and “there is no more need for
a public official in the exercise of
his duties to fear a Klansman than
there is for him to fear the repu
blican or democratic parties, if as
much, because both parties are in
politics and the Klan is not.”
In spite of this attitude and some
vigorous efforts to convince law of
fleers of it. there is evidence that
in Klan counties it ia hard to get
convictions of Klansmen. One in
stance occurred at Macon, Ga., where
several men were on trial for night
riding. The first man up was ac

quitted, and when the second man
was arragned the Grand Dragon sent
a message, which was read to the
.inry, that the Klun did not support
him nor wish anything hut justice.
On the same evidence as In the first
ease the jury hung. It seems clear
that in sending that message Gen.
Forrest admitted his own belief that
the first jury had been swayed by
fear of the Klan.
There were similar cases in Tulsa,
Okla., after the Klan strength there
became manifest, and I was told
that no Klansman had been convict
ed of anything since the Klan-sup
ported administration took charge.
This is hardly a record to be ac
counted for by the virtue of Klans
men. There can be no doubt, too,
that any officials who owe their elec
tion to Klan support will be inclin
ed by common gratitude to give
Klansmen all the favors their con
sciences will allow; some official con
sciences are very elastic, and the
gratitude of politicans is more than
that of common men. since re-elec
tion depends on it. So there is lit
tle doubt that the law in Klan com
munities is likely to favor Klans
men—as it does certain other class
es in oilier places. Rut this Is an
evil of popular government, not
chargeable to the Klan unless It puts
pressure on the law officers, a mat
ter almost Impossible to prove.
On the whole however, there is a
good deal to show that the general
effect of the Klan crusades has been
g«tad. The circuit judge quoted in n
previous article told me that in his
district the Klan had done “sub
stantial justice;” an Oklahoma judge
confirmed this. Both said \hat the
general morality and decency had
been improved. My own observations
agree with this. This judgment is,
of course entirely apart from any
question of the good or evil of the
methods employed.
The same thing is true of crimes,
even of crimes of violence, in spite
of the general beliefs about the Klan.
The Klan information bureau has
statistics which show a decrease in
crime in the states where the Klan
is strong. For Louisiana they show
30 per cent less crime in the last
two years and in Texas about the
same, together with an increase in
convictions. Statistics from such a
source are subject to challenge, of
course; but it is certain that lynch
ing. which might be supposed a pe
culiarly Klannish crime, has de
creased more than half in the year
of the Klnn’s great growth. There
are several instances where Klans
have helped sheriffs prevent mob
violence.
While on the subject of crime it
may be well to give Dr. Evans’ state
ment about the Mer Rouge affair,
since that is often cited as a com
plete condemnation of the Klan.
This is the first official statement
that has come from a Klan leader
on the subject .and denies both that
Klansmen were guilty or that the
Klan refused to help the prosecu
tion.
“The true story of Mer Rouge has
not been told.” he said. “That is
about all the Klan knows about it.
It does not know who was guilty nor
of what they were guilty. It docs
know that the prosecution of the
ease lias been proceeding on a wrong
theory and against the wrong men.
It has hern accused of not aiding the
prosecution; It has had no Informa
tion that It could give. Some such
Information, as yet unverified, has
rerently come to us. If that Informa
tion proves correct it will be given
to the authorities and the truth
will be learned at last.”
In all this Klan crusading there
has been much talk of abuse of in
nocent people and of punishment in-
flicted for the mere fact of oppos
ing the Klan when there were no
charges of crime or misconduct.
Here again the situation is foggy.
Undoubtedly there have been cases
of mob violence when there was no
least justification for it, and many
of these have occurred at times and
places where the Klan was active.
The Klan’s denial of responsibility
in such cases is not convicing, since
the conditions which make such out
rages p<*sible, if not the outrages
themselves, are due to the Klan. In
fairness it must be added that the
proportion of these cases to the total
activities of the Klan is very small,
and that most of them that I have
heard of took place before the
Evans reforms.
One more point: Dr. Evans and
the other leaders are now trying to
stop “meddling” with the private
conduct of people, as they have
stopped night-riding. The rule has
been laid down that the Klan shall
never take direct action, and that
no case shall be acted upon except
through the regular law officers un
der enacted statutes. Dr. Evans be
lieves that “meddling” largely has
been stopped, but I am forced to
disagree with him. The cases I have
cited are all recent and in northern
and eastern states. There is reason
to believe that the evil is decreas
ing considerably, but it is far from
dead.
It will be observed that all these
methods of the Klan. including those
disapproved by the leaders, are en
tirely violence. It is hard to attack
them in the abstract even on moral
grounds since they are, in the last
analysis, nothing more than an or
ganized exercise of the right to like
whom we please, associate with whom
we please, and do business where we
please. All of us do that. We have
neard a good deal lately about the
Immense good to be done by public
opinion and “social ami economic
pressure.” Here we have It; the Klan
lias made it a science!
The objection, of course, is that
this is private justice, outside the
law, without trial or the chance for
defense. True, but the same can be
said of the personal verdicts and pre
ferences which each of us passes
and enforces daily. As to the use of
rumors, we all act constantly on un
proved rumors, and make people
suffer from them. The Klan has or
ganized both rumor and opinion and
it would seem at first tnat there
could be no very well-founded ob
jection nor very strong condemna
tion for merely doing better things
that we all do.
Yet there is objection. Almost
everywhere that the Klan appears
there soon develops very bitter oppo
sition. This comes not merely from
the vicious and criminal classes hit
in the reform campaigns. That is to
he expcced and is a good symptom.
It oomes also, of course, from Catho
lics, Jews and aliens and has appar
ently resulted in strengthening the
unity of these classes, thus producing
an effect directly opposite to that
at which the Klan aims. I say “ap
parently” because while there are
many statements that this is the
case I have been unable to obtain
from the Knights of Columbus or
the It’iiai B’rltli answers to letters
asking for the facts. But this oppo
sition also was to be expected, and
in so far as parts of these classes
have been working for class or anti-
American interests, it is also whole
some.
Entirely apart from this, however,
there is strong opposition and in
tense feeling against the Klan in
many places among the native, white
Protestants to whom it is expected
to appeal. Hie reasons for tills are
rather obscure, since it seems to ba
based only in small part on charges
that the Klan has been unjust in in
dividual cases .and is frequently ac
companied by the admission that it

has done good. The reasons given are
vague and not fundamental; disap
proval of secrecy, of espionage, or
the statement that “nobody's got any
business doing such things.”
There are many people, of
who hate the Klan merely becauae
they fear it, and never acknowledge
that reason. But the real cause of
the most serious opixvsition seems te
me to lie in the complaint agaiut
meddling. On analysis it shows three
sound reasons against the Klan meth
ods, even against the modified meth
ods the leaders are trying to enforce.
The first is that public opinion an 4
our own accustomed punishment ef
obnoxious persons are often unjust
and unfair, imply a right to judgment
which cannot be well maintained,
and are tempered by varying opinion
in the community as a whole. The
evils, overlooked and ignored in or
dinary social relations, become mag
nified and self-condemning when they
appear on a large and organised
scale.
In the second place there is ®
vast difference between pressure ap
plied by the community as a whole
and a similar pressure applied even
in the same ways, by a part of the
community which has arrogated full
power to itself. In the third place
there is no safeguard that the power
of the Klan will not be perverted
at any moment to all kinds of per
sonal desires —spite, jealousy, re
venge, ambition or plain meanness.
The objections to the Klau on Qm
ground of secrecy and espionage ere
loud but very often do not ring tree.
.Most of those I have heard have been
from men who themselves belong t«
organizations more or less secret and
more or less accustomed to use ce
lt (ounce. They are anxious for lawn
which will stop the Klan from using
those weapons, but balk when *nj
attempt is made to provide law
which will stop all organization®
from using them. This probably ac
counts for the futility of all anti-
Klan laws so far passed. There
of course, a few men who are clear
sighted and public-spirited enough te
see these things evils in them
selves. Many of them are fighting
the Klan, but they do not single it
out for hatred above other bodies*
At any rate, the opposition ia
there. In some places it has divided
quiet communities into hostile fac
tions. In others it is at present hid
den, held down by fear of the Klan,
but ready to spring into aotion U
ever that fear dies. The Kian, I be
lieve, will be stunned to find how
great a bay hut w ill arise at Its first
sign of weakness. The storm whick
followed the collapse of the Know-
Nothings made their name a hissing
for two generations, and this will
not be less. Tills supressed hatred
also makes it certain that if the
Klan does start to break up, its fall
will be even faster than its growth.
Important as are these social ac
tivities of the Klan, its politick
power and its results in that field
are even more so. It can only be
through politics that it may carry
out its official aims; it is only in
politics that it can even make it*
social reforms permanent. The Klan
denies that it is in politics, yet in
the same breath I)r. Evans declare*
that its program “must result in po
litical action and be carried out in
no other way.” The Klan in politic*
and what it means in the govern
ment of America and particularly in
the coming election, will be taken
up in the next, and final article.
