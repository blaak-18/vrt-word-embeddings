* believing that where ignorance is bliss
it is folly to be wise about what is put
in the hash. The honest Philadelphia
Sgrocer says: "If I had my just de=
serts I would be in the penitentiary
for selling adulterated groceries. Sc
e would every other retail grocer. I
r don't think one-fifth of the stock I sell
is what I represent it to be. Take
cod fish. Mine is either hake or had
dock, and I sell it for 8 cents. Real
codfish cost 9 cents a pound, whole
sale. I sell a brand of tomato catsup
for 6 cents a bottle, and four-fifths of
it is pumpkin. My stale cake is all
L taken back by the manufacturer, who
makes them over again into fresh ones.
Take those cheap ginger snaps. There
is not a speck of ginger in them. The
manufacturer couldn't afford to put
ginger in them at the price. Cayenne
pepper is used to give them that sharp
flavor." And the repentant grocer
paused to sell a customer two pounds
of coffee, which probably wasn't coffee
at all.

WOMEN IN CHUROHI WORN.
Orowth asd Userlames the oar ot
Deseesmo.
The ministry of women In the church t
has always been a potent factor in the
influence of Christianity. A great im- i
pulse was given to the somewhat de- )
sultory and in some ways regular work
of women in the field of evangelization r
by the passage of the canon of deacon- r
eases in the general convention of 1889. I,
Mrs. Twing in. her fourth triennial re- I
port of the woman's auxiliary draws at- a
tention to evidence, derived from her I
wide travels of how literally the church v
was taken at her word in passing the
admirable canon. Deaconesses are ac
tively engaged in prosecuting their
ministry in fourteen dioceses and mis
slonary jurisdictions in this country.
The dignity and power given by the
diaconate of female workers has re
sulted in commending the deaconess
movement in all quarters. Two ad
mirable schools are now flourishing, h
one in New York, the other in Phila
delphia, where ladies of cultivation and d
refinement are studying the practical. f
intellectual and devotional sides of
their future profession. From many
large parishes in other quarters calls
are constantly being made for the ser
vices of women, thus prepared, trained
and set apart. It has been found that 1
a deaconess becomes an almost indis
pensable agent in carrying on certain b
branches of philanthropic and elee- t
mosynary work in a parish. A new a
race of educated Sunday school teach. c
ers and superintendents is also being ,
introduced in the city parishes in the i
persons of deaconesses who have under
gone a theological course before ven
turing to teach children what they t
ought to know and believe for their a
souls' health. As teachers, nurses, via- b
Itors of the sick and of the poor, the t
deaconesses have proved a godsend to a
many a parish. We are not, therefore, 11
surprised to And that in the far east b
the missionary churches are seeking to ti
strengthen the hands of the clergy by J
instituting deaconesses. Mrs Twain h
tells us that a canon of deaconesses, a
translation into Japanese of the Amerl- n
can canon, is now before the church in ii
Japan, and will be acted upon at the q
next synod. The bishop has already a
four candidates for the sacred and hon
oraho ofce. This is a very hopeful
aspect We quite expect before long M
to see educqd women from all parts
of the couany seking in the diacenate
a sphere of activity which is amon the
most exalted and useful to be found.
The training schools in New York and
Philadelphia are already pretty well
supplied with students, but this growing
movement will ere long necessitate a
much larger institutions for the satis
faction of its requirements.--Ez,

A New Scheme.
Representative Pugh, of Kentucky,
has prepared a bill to permit cities of
100,000 or more inhabitants to obtain
postage stamps of special design. The
bill provides that such cities may peti
tion and obtain from the postoflice
authorities stamps of special design,
commemorating the history of the city
or the memory of some deceased inhab
itant. Mr. Pugh thinks that these
stamps will meet a long-felt want, and
that if they are once tried will be sure
to stick. It is a great scheme. Here
after the man who endears himself to
his fellow-townsmen by making a for
tune will stand in with the boys and get
his picture put on the postage stamp,
Instead of giving a school or college to
bear his name. The old stamps that bore
the pictures of Washington, Franklin,
Jefferson, Lincoln and other national
heroes seemed to get there all right,
and unprogressive people don't see the
necessity of swapping them off for the
likenesses of jay congressmen or rich
speculators. That kind of a stamp
will be licked by all thoughtful people.

Deafness is caused by an Inflamed con

taehian Tube. When the tube is In
lamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it is en
tirely closed Deafness is the result, and
unless the Inflammation can be taken
out and this tube restored to its normal
condition, hearing will be destroyed for
ever; nine cases out of ten are caused
by Catarrh, which I. nothing but an in
