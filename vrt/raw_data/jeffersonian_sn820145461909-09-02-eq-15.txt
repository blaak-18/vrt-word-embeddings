Catarrh is not only dangerous, but it
causes bad breath, ulceration, death
and decay of bones, loss of thinking
and reasoning power, kills ambition
and energy, often causes loss of appe
tite, indigestion, dyspepsia, raw throat
and reaches to general debility, idiocy
and insanity. It needs attention at
once. Cure it with Gauss’ Catarrh
Cure. It is a quick, radical, permanent
cure, because it rids the system of the
poison germs that cause catarrh.
In order to prove to all who are suf
fering from this dangerous and loath
some disease that Gauss’ Catarrh Curd
will actually cure any case of catarrh
quickly, no matter how long standing
or how bad, I will send a trial pack
age by mail free of all cost. Send us
your name and address today and the
treatment will be sent you by return
mail. Try it! It will positively cure
so that you will be welcomed instead
of shunned by your friends. C. E.

MISSIONARY WORK USELESS.
Thinkers seem increasing in num
bers in every direction. Way up there
in Skagway, Alaska, there is pub
lished a daily which dares give ex
pression to the honest opinion of its
editor. He says:
“The massacre of several Ameri
can missionaries in Turkey is in it
self deplorable, but it serves to re
mind us of the indubitable fact that
these men and women would not be
killed if they had been at work where
they really belong—at home and not
abroad. It is an open question if
foreign missionaries have not accom
plished quite as much harm as good.
They attempt to convert to Christi
anity races which have been born
and bred to different religious ideals.
On paper they accomplish many con
versions; in reality it is hardly prob
able they make one real Christian
out of a hundred converts. In most
cases the so-called Christianity of
Turkish, African or Chinese converts
is hardly skin deep.
“The missionaries breed strife; for
a variance in religious belief is cer
tain to lead to trouble. Again, most
native races are happier and just as
well off with their own peculiar reli
gion, be it Buddhism, Confucianism
or Mohammedanism. Religion is a
matter of evolution and it is folly to
try to shove a white man’s religion
into a black or yellow race. Invaria
ble massacres have marked the pro
gress of the missionary in China,
Africa, Turkey and among our own
Indians. Other tangible results are
few.
“On the other hand among the
slums in our great cities there is a
great field for social work, and the
work will have good results. If one
half the money wasted on foreign
missions were spent at home every
body concerned would be better off.”

Thinker, Chicago.

ANECDOTE OF EX - PRESIDENT
ANDREW JACKSON.
Among the mountain people of the
South, more particularly among the
mountain people of East Tennessee, it is
believed that a sure cure for “fits” is a
piece of the rope with which an inno
cent person has been hanged, or a part of
the chain with which an innocent person
has been shackled.
Concerning this, the following anec
dote was once related to me by a friend
who was a boy in Greenville, Tenn., at
the time the incident occurred, and who
saw and heard every word that passed.
As is well known, President Andrew
Johnson incurred the intense hostility of
the Northern radicals as well as of the
Southern “unreconstructed rebels.” In
the South the extremists hated him bit
terly for his course during the Civil
War, and they held against him the in
dignities heaped upon ex-President Davis
during his imprisonment at Fortress
Monroe, and the execution of Mrs. Sur
ratt, who was universally believed to be
innocent of any connection with the as
sassination of President Lincoln.
Among those who hated President
Johnson was a maiden lady of middle
age and unbridled tongue, who lived in
Greenville, Tenn., the home town of
Johnson. She was a privileged charac
ter, saying pretty much what she pleased
to everybody.
Soon after ex-President Johnson re
turned to Greenville to live, at the ex
piration of his term of office, he hap
pened to pass along the street one day
when this lady—who represented the
most beligerent type of Southern sym
pathizers—was sitting on the front ve
randa talking to some friends. Catching
sight of Johnson, she sprang to her feet
and hailed him.
“Good morning, Mr. President.”
Johnson lifted his hat and returned
the salutation:
“Good morning, Miss ,” and was
about to pass on when she checked him
with the question, asked in a loud voice
which had a defiant challenge in it:
“What are you now going to do for a
living, Mr. President?”
Johnson was, naturally, taken aback
by any such public question as this, but
he answered readily enough:

“I have not yet decided, Miss ,
what I will do.”
Then in a triumphant tone, in which
the very quintessence of political bitter
ness was expressed, she cried:
“Let me tell you what you do: you get
a piece of the chain with which you had
Jeff Davis manacled with, and a piece of
the rope with which you had Mrs. Sur
ratt hanged, and you go up into the
mountains of East Tennessee and make
a living curing fits.”
For a moment Johnson seemed
stunned. It was like a slap in the face
to a man who was not expecting it. Re
covering himself as well as he could, he
lifted his hat slightly, and, with a
“Good-morning, Miss ,” passed on
his way down the street.
THE PARTY NAME.
The men you employ to make your
laws at Washington have been doing
it with a vengeance. Take, for in
stance, their laws regarding postal
affairs. Not only do they give the
railroad corporations eight times the
price for hauling the mails that the
railroads charge for hauling the same
number of pounds of express on the
same trains, but they charge you
sixty times as much as Germany
charges for the same service. But
even that is not all. German mer
chants can ship any weight of pack
age up to eleven pounds across the
American Continent through our
mail system for less money than you
can send it five miles. Any foreign
merchant can use the United States
postal system for one-fourth to one
half less than what you have to pay.
Those blessed Congressmen you have
been voting for all your lives have
been doing this to you. But in your
ignorance of what they are doing you
continue to elect them year after
year. All you know about politics is
the sound of the party name. Now
isn’t that about true?—Messenger.
We hope Governor Brown will fa
cilitate matters by appointing Rail
road Commissioner McLendon to suc
ceed himself. We did not vote for
him, but we believe in an honest,
square deal on the merits of every
case and man.—Middle Georgia
Farmer, Griffin, Ga.
