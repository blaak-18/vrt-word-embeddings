iMr. EniiA Gueble, a brother of
Mrs. Radul Gentil of this town,
died"In New Orleans on Oct. 28,
at the age of j.yiears.
'fidge Debaillon returned Sunday
Evening from Vermilion parish,
where he was invited to make a
speech at a bemocratic meeting.
While at Carencro last Sunday we
wer, informed that preparations a e
being made by Father LaForest to
give a grand fair for colored people
on the 17 and x8th of November.
Charles Harnish, who is breaking
oa the Alexandria road, came near
being the victim of a fatal accident
while at work last Tuesday, but for
tunately received otly a slight in
jury on the foot.
The Pilette troope of amateurs
played at Falk's Saturday night to a
small but appreciative audience.
The entertainment consisted of short
comedies in French and English
and the creditable way in which
all the actors acquitted themselves
should be a source of pleasure and
pride to their instructor, Prof. Alex
Meaux.
The Police Jury has accepted the
bridge recently built over Vermilion
river by. Mr. Fred Mouton. The
Gazette compliments the contractor
upon this splendid piece of work.
The revival which had been going
on at the Methodist church for two
weeks, closed last Sunday after
a very successful session. Eighty
persons were converted and thirty
two joined the church. Rev. T.
S. Randle conducted the ceremo
hies; he was assisted by Revs. Beard,
Manly, Neal, and Ross Randle.
Last week fire destroyed five
bales of cotton in the ginnery of
Emile Arcenaux near Carencro.
It was thought to be the work of
an incendiary and the circumstances
surrounding the case led to the ar
rest of Portalis Martin, a negro
woman and her son, Pierre, who
were brought to town and turned
over to Jailer Billaud.
Sheriff Broussard never fails to
iatch his man and unless the niggers
behave themselves he will have
an unusually large number of them
to take to the pen at the next term
of court. It will be remembered
that Mr. Benton was shot on the
highway by a negro. As soon as
he heard of the occurrence the
sheriff immediately started to work
to discover the culprit and soon
secured sufficient proof to justify
the arrest of a young negro named
Alexandre Navarre, who is now
charged with the commission of
this crime.
Since the visit to Lafayette of
1 o lisiana's junior' denator we have
noticed that a certain well-known
young man is making desperate ef
forts to raise "a crop of whiskers"
similar to that which gives such
a distinguished look to the Caddo
gentleman. We have warned him
of our intention to make a note of
it, but he persists in his determi
nation to wear whiskers that will put
to shame the flamboyant growth
which covers the face of Senator
P'feffer of Kansas.
Meeting at Carencro.
About 2506 white voteris met at
Carencro last Sunday to hear Dem
ocratic speakers discuss the issues
involved in the present campaign.
Mr. A. C. Guilbeau called the
ineeting to order and diominated
Mr. V. E. Dupuis as president and
Mr. H. E, Toll, as secretary.
Hon. Wm. Campbell was the first
speaker who addressed the mfeeting.
He made a straight-forward talk,
denounced the attempt of the bolt
ters to Africanize this State and
proceeded tg excoriate the Repub
licans in the latest approved style.
'The speaker then paid his respects
to Prof. Ktlapp, a leading Republi
Can. When the hnme of this
worthy was mentioned, the deafen
ing applause that followed showed
how well he is remembered by his
former neighbors.
SThe next ,speaker was E. .O;
Voorhies, Esq., who spoke in sim
ple, chaste French, entertaining the
audience in his usual pleasing
style. He ittnde a very effective
address, full of unanswerable logic
aind spiced with witty and appro
priate anecdotes,
The last speaker was judge O
C. Mouton, who handled facts anid
figures and n'ade a very convincing
speech. '
TIhe speakers- were applauded in
a manner that unmistakably showed
I tat old Carencro had not yet de
sided to "i'flop."
THE RMPUBlIJCANrS.
The much Advertised Republican
meeting hat come nhd gone and
with it has left most of the enthusi
asm. If the speakers succeeded in
converting one solitary voter to the
Republican faith of pioti-'tion- and
bounty he has been so quiet that we
have failed to hear of him. There
was a brass band, and fortunately
for the speakers the music attracted
a number of boys who helped to
fill the seats, thus avoiding the ora
tors the unpleasant task of orating
to an audience composed mostly of
unsympathetic Democrats and empty
seats. In the rear of the hall could
be seen a crowd of 40 or 50o negroes,
who presented a somewhat unusual
scene, for, since several years the
colored man here has been, politi
cally speaking, simply "not in it."
All in all the audience numbered
about z6o people, who without ex
ception, behaved very well, perfect
order prevailing throughout the
meeting.
The assembly was called to order
by Mr. F. Otto, a leading Republi
can, who made a few appropriate
remarks and requested Mr. J. M.
Jones to preside, and asked Dr. H.
D. Guidry to act as secretary.
After being called the following
gentlemen took seats on the plat
form and served as vice-presidents:
Andrew Cayard, Hugh Hutcheson,
Ben F. Flanders, Jr., Aurelien Pri
meaux, Judge J. G. Parkerson.
Chairmans Jones introduced Col.
Gus. A. Breaux as the first speaker.
The colonel spoke in French. He
said that he had always been a pro
tectionist, but was forced to remain
in the Democratic party by the ne
gro. In his opinion the negro had
ceased to be a dangerous factor in
politics and he would hereafter vote
the Republican ticket. How the
negro had so suddenly dwindled in
to utter insignificance the colonel
failed to explain. The colonel said
that come what may the white man
had the brains, the heart and the
strength and would rule, but he did
not say how the negro, Henry De
mas, bossed the sugar-teats in the
Second district and nominated Cole
man against the expressed wishes
of the sugar-planters, who according
to the colonel, possessed the brains,
hearts, etc. The distinguished gen
tleman spoke of the right of voting
guaranteed to the negro by the lawys,
and said that this right should be
respected. Col. Breaux's address,
though of undoubted ability, was
a repetition of the exploded argu
ments of the bolters.
Judge Beattie, the congressional
candidate was the next and last
speaker. Owing to the bad con
dition of his throat his address was
brief. The judge uses some very
forcible English and handles every
thing Democratic without gloves.
He showed the utmost disregard
for the feelings of the Democrats
who were present. If the judge
keeps on at the rate he was going
here he'll not have a single vial of
wrath left for after the election,
when it will be in demand. Judge
Beattie is a good speaker and though
suffering from his throat kept
the audience interested throughout
his speech.
The committee on resolutions
composed of Messrs. P. Dema
nade, Will Cayard, T. J. Breaux,
Emile Romero, Dr. H. D. Guidry,
J. G. Parkerson, reported the fol
lowing which was adopted.
ReJsoltved, That we citizens of the
parish of Lafayette do hereby ratify
and endorse the nomination of Tay
lor Beattie for Congressman from
the Third Congressional district and
pledge him our undivided support.
The nimeeting then adjourned.
Judge Bowen went to Algiers
Wednesday.
Mr. Martial Billaud's refinery
commenced orperation last Satur
day. A large crop will be ground
at this mill.
rwo Lives Saved.
Mrs. Phoebe Thomas, of Junction City, Ill.
was told by her doctors she had Consumption
and that there was no hope for her, but two
bottles Dr. King's New Discovery completely
cured her and she says it saved her life. Mr.
Thus. Eggers, 139 FloridaSt. San Francisco,
suffered from a dreadful cold, appronching
Consuriiptioii, tried without result everything
else then bought one bottle of Dr. King's
New Discovery and in two weeks was cured.
I-Ie is naturally thankful. It is such results,
of which these are samples, that prove the
toonderful efficacy of thisamedicine in Coughs
and Colds. Free trial bottles at WVm. Clegg's
Drug Store. Regular size Soc. and S.oo.
Those who talk about the "rights"
of the negroes are the very men
who will get thehe~ pror people into
serious trouble. The negro's best
friend is the white man who advises
him td let politics alone, and it is
he, who will help him, and tot
the untirtipulous politician who
wants his vote. Wlhat did Kellogg
and WVarmoth evier do' for the nie
groes? They got him in trotible
and skipped with the boodle. That
is exactly Whit those who are talk- -
ing about the "'Iegal rights of the
.olored man" will do.

AT ROYVILLl
Happenings in the Busy iand
Thrifty Town-- Reported
for the Cbliunns of The
Gazette.
-Fourth ward voters, buckle on
your armors, and cast a solid vote
for Price and good times, next
Tuesday.
-Price is booked for a heavy
majority over Beattie in Lafayette,
and all voters interested in the well
fare of their families, should help to
give it to him next Tuesday.
-With Beattie and his Republi
can allies iti power a serious con
flict between the races is inevitable.
Louisiana has had an overdose of
negro rule, and unless we are in er
ror wool will fly before a mongrel
government is established in this
State.
-Do not forget the grand barbe
cue at RoyVille tomorrow Sunday.
Come all of you to enjoy the juicy
steaks of a Democratic beef.
Speeches by eloquent speakers will
convince youi that nothwithstanding
all the slander and lies the Repub
lican party is using in this cam
paign that the Democratic is
the only party whose principles are
honesty, white rule and good gov
ernment. Theretore it is the only
white man's party in Louisiana and
in the South.
-Negro bull-dozing is dead sev
eral years now. The ignorant black
has been tatight his inferiority. He
is aware that he figures as a "dead
head" in Louisiana politics; he al
ready knows that he'll be again made
a target of, and by great Jehovah !
why don't he keep company to his
faithful mule. Take your chances,
blacks, but do not say you have not
been warned in time ! !
-Judge Greig, of the fifth ward,
administered, last Monday, the
oath of office to our lately appointed
post-master, Mr. A. A. Mouchet.
Friend Albert is a thorough gen
tleman, fully competent to conduct
the office with satisfaction to all.
-IHon. Judge Debaillon and Ar
thur Greig, Esq., of Lafayette,
passed through town Saturday en
route to Erath station and Mau
riceville.
-Mr. Clemile Landry was a
pleasant visitor to our town Satur
day.
-Dr. Scranton is on the sick
list this week. We hope to see the
doctor up and well 'ere shortly.
-Mrs. Dupleix, we are happy to
state, is better. Latest report from
the attending physician pronounces
her out of danger.
-Mrs. Hilaire David, mother of
Mr. J. H. David, died suddenly
Sunday morning from failure of the
heart. The aged lady was drinking
her morning coffee, when she was
seen to reel and drop dead in her
rocking chair. To the relatives and
friends in this great hour of their
bereavement, we offer our sympa
th3.
-Messrs. Parkerson, Judice, Gi
rard and Nickerson, were late visit
ors to Roy ville.
-Those faithful Democrats and
firm adherents of white supremacy,
Marcel Melancon, J. Langlinais, Sr.
Belony Trahan, Nap Nepoleon,
Eupemon LeBlanc, Jules Landry
and others, were pleasant callers
the past week. Come often, gen
tlemen. A hearty welcoume always
awaits you.
-The tax-payers of Latayette
are not again willing to pay extra
taxes to the government in order
to meet heavy payments out of the
United States treasury to the rich
sugar planters. It stands to reason
that every a cents for every
pound of sugar raised in the State,
is that much money taken out of
the pockets of the people. The
poor white man is the sufferer. He
is not in onre iota benefited. Two
thirds of the sugar planters prefer
negro labor, knocking out of em
ployment the poor white laborer.
Had the bounty existed only ten
years, Louisiana would have be
come the property (including peo
ple and all) of the sugar planters.
They would have adopted a new
constitution, framed from their in
genious and scheming brains; a
crown and royal court, with king,
princes; etc., would have been duly
installed according to their rank
andl fina'rcial position. Their game
is nipped in the bud, and the only
means of preventing these auto
crats froti selling Louisiana to the
Republicans, is by casting an dpen
ticket next Tuesday for Price and
