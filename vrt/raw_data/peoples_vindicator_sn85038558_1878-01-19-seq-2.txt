The Constltutional Conventlon. n
We think, to judge from the tone
of the country press as expressed
dlning the past four nmonths, that at at
least 90 per cent of the Droc:ratic ,
party is in favor of a Constitutional il1
Convention, the remaining 10 per ti
cent certainly favors chan!es in the ii
present instrument, and rudical changes
at that.
It is quite interesting to peruse the
"'interviews" of the New Orleans t
Democrat ieporter with the solons-
vulgarly supposed to represent thtih
constituents, now, giving us of Lou
isiana an exhibition of the "combined C'
talent" of the State.
Senator Robertson (Dem.) 10th
District, stands up:
Senator R.-I came to this city
warmly in favor of a convention, Si
but since my arrival, and after con
sultation with representative men of h1
the Democratic party in the city and n
from the country, I am satisfied that h,
a call for a convention at the present a1
time would be impolitic. I believe
that my constituents in the Tenth
Senatorial District recognize the ir
IMPORTANCE OF CHANGES p
In the constitution that would allow
the General Assembly to reduce tax
ation; but while they demand these
reforms, I do not believe that they P
are particular as to the manner in tj
which they are to be brought about,
and believe that they would prefer tl
that they should be brought about by O
amendments proposed by the General
Assembly, rather than by a constitu- t
tional couvention. Should there be a
any doubt of the result of on election t,
for said convention, which, from con
sultation with prominent members of ti
our party, I have. a
COME TO THIE CONCLUSION 51
there would be, then I would go with e
my party. c
Comment: The Senator has a queer
idea of representing his constituency I
who favor (if we are to judge from s
the Press of his District, which is
better authority than the noble Sena
tor) a Constitutional Convention. 1
"Coming to the city" changed his U
opinion.
Whom does he represent
Senator L. E. Texada, of the I
Twenty third Senatorial District, r
comprising the parishes of Rapides t
and Vernon, was the first gentleman 1
spoken to upon the subject, lie being
decidedly opposed to a convention, a
stating that lihe thought the people of 1
the country were much opposed to "
the calling of a constitutional conven
tion at this time-not that they do t
not recognize the necessity of training P
amendments to that fundamental law,
but that they do not think the pres
ent an opportune time to bring on a t
political campaign.
"To tell you the truth, sir," said c
he, "our people, after the past har- f
lssing campaigns, want political rest.
They have had a surfeit of excite- '
ment, and what we need now is time
to devote ourselves to other pursuits."''
lIe did not think that an election for I
members of a convention at this time
would work anything but harm to the 1
State. The election of 1878f for State
Treasurer is not far distant, and an
other election before it vould be
INJURIOUS TO OUR PEOPLE.
When asked whether or not it
woold be the most expedfent course
to have the amendmelts lnsseid by
the Legislature, aad then submlnitted
to the people at thie election for the
Treasurer, he said that he thought,
possibly, that would be the better
course, as it would save thie peoplle
from the excitement incidental to an
additional campaign.
However, if thie party decided to
hold a convention, hie would support
the nmecasure, Imt, individually, he
was opposed to it, as were the think
ing men of his constituents.
There were too many idle people in
the State now, he thought, to agitate
seach a measure, and until they could
be provided with employment it
would be better not to disturb the
people of thie State.
The VINDICATOR 8has a larger cir
solation in Vernon than any pape:
published in the State. Its corree
pondence with private gentlemen and
conversations with citizens and ac
quoaintances of Rapides, leave no
doubt that Mr. Texnds ma not repre
senting lh constituen ts.
Senator H. C. Mitchell, of the
Twentieth Senatorial District, com
prising the parishes of Bossier, Bien
ville, Claiborne and Webster, had
very decided views in opposition to a
convention. There were questions
thrt could not be discussed in a con
vention, and, besides, it was by no
meoe an a assured fact that the bet
ter elenment would control ifs action
in framing a constitution. For these
reasons he opposed a convention and
would do so were the quaietion brought
up in the Legislature.
Then why not, Mr. Mitchell, abol
ida Constitutions entirely. Your
opinions are antiRepublican and un
'Amerlcan.
Senator James HI. Grover, of the
First District (First, Second and
Third Wards), being spoken to on the
subject, said he was in favor of a
constitutional convention immediate
ty, if it did not interfere with State
fiances and the present policy of
the State.
Mr. Grover ia guarded, or rather
"devilishl sly." He's a "finance man.'
Ticklish on the State Consols.
Senator Cornelius O'Donnell, of the
Fourth. 8qnarrlal District, compris
og thel Tenth and Eleventh Wards,
belog interviewed on the same sub.
joet, expressed the opinion that he
wain favoee of a constaittional con
yenthso, bet not at the present time;
that he. did not believe Ia twworele
Ifons coming together.
Mr. O'Donnell ia againasta Conven
tion from the fact that no Constitu in
tion could be had without "the two '(l
kn
elections coming together." a
Representative Geo. T. Pitts, of 9,
DeSoto parish, was in favor of a re- Litt
vision f fthe constitution. He thought
lie people of DeSoto would favor
such a jplan, but Ihey would oppose t
any convention that necessitated an
election of delegates. The people ac
did not want an election, with its ex- Le
citement and expense. They were L
alsio emphatically opposed to

uiltiity was great, before the expirn- pa
tion of his term. lie thought the
matter could be alranged b,) a com- w
mission app-intetd to asggrst veristio. to
Mr. Pitts, we turn you over to the till
Reporter and the Democrat, of your ut
pali.sh, with the simple statement
that .Mr. Pitts does not express the nit
views of his people at all. Gov. the
Nicholls has nothing to do with this Atli
contest, and we would consider him thl
or any other man very dear at $.,- til
700,X)0 yeaily, for four years-or a
total of over ten millions of dollars. an
Representative J. M. Cressy, of the dit
Seventh Ward, was Ni
EMPHATICALLY OPPOSED TO IT, of
le said, for rarious reasons, promi- P1
nent among them being that it would po
be an expense the people could ill do
atllod now ; and, further, all the Al
amenduments or revisions necessary
could be obtained through the Legis. to
lature and then by vote of the peo
ple.
While "np," will Mr. Cressy tell us
how the people can "afford" the "ex- lie
pense" the present Constitution en- .th
tails upon them. 11till
Representative Clias. Tremnoulet, of '
r the Seventh Ward, was emphatically i
opposed to a convention. All the re
quired revision could be made through
the Legislature, and by that means n
an expression could be obtained from
the people as to their views. it'
f Representative Wm. HII. Peralta, of In
the Fifth Ward, said: "No, indeed, te
sir; I am not in favor of any con- el
stitutional convention. It is not nee
essary, and every needed amendment
can be made through the Legislature." th
r These gentleman belong to the em- m
lphatic crowd. They conslitute, what i"
u some country papers has chose to call at
s "all the brains in the State." to
Representative C. J. Berry, of the a
Tenth Ward, parish of Orleans, upon "s1
t being asked his opinion on the sub. Ia
ject of a constitutional convention re- T
plied: "I think it inexpedient, at
least, at this time. We have- had m
e politics enough in this State. We
want peace and prosperity, and poli
8 tics mean anything but peace. Party fa
n lines, that may have been smoulder- et
ing, ought to be allowed to burn out is
Sand not be lit tip again, which would
,f he the case, I think, should a con
n stitutional convention be called. in
Democrats or Republicans, Conserva- tr
o tires, or Workingmen or Native J:
Americans, ought to take an interest
in the welfare of the State, if they
have not yet done so. A constitu- ei
a tional convention, in my opinion, ei
would open aniothlier political strife,
l which the people do not desire andt
for which they are not ready. VWe
want railroads, internal improve
nimeuts, that are more of a necessity
e at present tlihan a change in our con
stitution. The State credit wants to
be established. The expenses of the
Sgovernment should not exceed its
Srevenues, and that is a step towards
SCARRYING OUT THIE PIINCIPLE8 L
Son which the Democratic-Conserva
tive party got into power. This Leg
islature, although unlder the present C
it costitntion ;t cannot cnrtail certain a
, xpenditures, ought to leaveo as n n
heir loom for its successors a law that
will reduce the expenses of the gov
ernment in the matter of salaries, per
tdiem, mileage, etc. This will be a
mort direct ipractical reform than aP
Sconstitutional convention. fi
Mn r. Berry is quite a goose if he
supposes he can get his logic palmed
t off. The "expenses of this govern-.
ment" is what we complain of; and
Syour "law that will reduce salaries,
&c.," is the very reason why we
in e
t should have a Convention, because
Id we want a Constitution which will not
it allow legislators to increase or dimin
ish salaries.
Representative R. P. Bridger, ofC
C'aldwell. Our reporter having miet
e Jutlge Bridger, asked him whether he
- had a defined opinion as to the proI I
] priety or necessity of calling a con
stitutionsa convention t
" Judge Bridger answered: "I have
o not, but with the lights before me I
e am rather inclined to oppose tihe call
ing oif a convention. I think that ex
isting evils can he remedied without
t the calling of a convention and nmuch
- more economically."
Mr. Bridger is one of the "penny
a wise and pound foolish," solons. Will
na he oblige us by taking his pencil and I
'calculating the difference between
Skeeping up the present "salaried Con
n titution" for three years, and the
se aring uander a Constitution with hion
est and reduced salaries, in that time.
Gen. John Young, also of Claiborne,
during the short conversation the re
i- porter had with himin, expressed it as
r his emphatic opinion that it would be
impodtieat this time to hold a con
vention. The people are now rapid
ly recovering from the effects of our
lie past disasters. The planters are now
d raising their own meat, and becoming
e independent of outside nmarkets for
a supplies. Sneh a thing has not ex
e- isted since the war, anid a political
te camtpaign, sueit' ae this convention
f would incur, would work nmuch harm
to us. I do not think that the reason
ler g people of our State want this,
and I believe that a very karge ma
jority would oppose it strongly.
Read, Mr. J. J. Duke, and you'll
lsee the difference between too Rep
resentatives from the same parish.
b Mr. Carlnss has not yet settled
e down to an opinion.
n- Hon. Jus. J. Duke, of Claiborne;
; was called upon. He was strongly
i- i favor of the proposed constitution
.1 conveatona, for he believed9 it to
Sbea snecesaity. There were artisIea
in the present constitution that te
quired a change, and so far as he
knew the people of his parish wanted
a convention to make them. Indi
vidually he was strongly in favor of
the movement.
HoD. James Brice, Jr., of Bienvil, h
upon being interviewed, answeied f,
that the people of his parish favored ti
a constitutional convention, and that i
he, as their representative in the "
Legislature, would advocate their i
views. ti
The above two gentlemen are real
representatives, and we trust they
will he remembered. And the last ,
gentleman is of the non committal it
part of our party.
lon. John Fitzpatrick, of the Third o
Ward, parish of Orleans, when asked p
to give his opinion the subject, stated
that he was not prepared to give any n
r at present.
It is scarcely necessary to com
went on the mass of words used by
these legislators, nor do we quote the
statements of Radicals contained in
the Democrat, they, as a mass think (
the present Constitution "a good one. '
The people can safely rest assured, t
and prepiare themselves, to be greatly
disappointed with this Legislature.
Nothing will be done to relive them
of the burdens of which they corn
oplain, and this "interview" settles a
1 point upon which there was some
I doubt, as to #hether we had at last
s ucceeded in getting the right men
to the front. We have not !
It is Demanded.
Now that iMajor Moncure's case has
been remanded to the state courts
there is no good resann why it should
not be decided one way or another at t
an early date. If pushed. as it should
be and as we believe it will be in the
hands of Messrs. Zacharie and Jonas,
it will result in giving to Mr. Mon
cure the office of State treasurer, to
, which he was faiirly elected in 1874.
n The honest returns gave him a major
itr of about 4000 votes, though the
'f infamous returning board manipula
1, ted him out of the office. He was
- even elected under the Wheeler com-rn
promise adjustment.
t Pending the controversy between
the Nicholls and Packard goveln
- ments there was some talk of ignor
it ing Mr. Moncure's claims in order to
neutralize Debuclet, and the State
authorities may hare been committed
to him. However that may be, it is
a case for the courts to settle and
should be settled according to the
law and the evidence.- [Shreveport
- Times.
it The people of Louisiana simply de
(l mand, and they intend to enforce
e Major Moncure's claims. He was
v fairly and honorably elected and is
- entitled to the office-not because he
it is Major Moncure, but because lie re
ceived the most votes. If he is not
1. installed, then the present adminis
tration must bear the onus. Before
'e January last we could blame Grant's
bayonets and the radical State gov
Sernment, now that excuse is no long

"Not opportune" is the tune the
Legislators are singing to the clamor
one people of the State we demand a
Constitutional Convention. It's not
an opera tune either but it's costly
music.
Where there's a will there's a way,
and thosle who would be cured of hy
pocondria and kindred ailments can
find the way by using that unequaled
tonic-elixir Home Stomach Bitters.
The Legislature threatens us with
"legislative reform." Every unpe
cunious newspaper, poor witness, and
shivering juror in the State is fright.
ened out of their wits at the "news."
This "investigation business" has
played out. You can't fire the hearts
of the people of this State by publish
ing the thefts of dead and usdone
radical officials ; the way to make
Democracy solid, is to do some ration
al reform ourselves. How would re
ducing the pay of legislators to $4
per day and 10 cents a mile mileage,
sound in a report t
4]ead It C retlly.
We publish in this week's issue of
the VINDICATOR an article from the
pen of Col. Gee. W. McCranie, editor
of the Ouachita Telegraph, which de
mands the careful attention of every
true citizen of the State. We entreat
our readers to peruse it carefully,
for their is more virtue, patriotism,
and more solid brain in it than in
a million of words for those who
pretend to represent Louisiana and
oppose the wants and demands of the
people.
Among the Dead Failures
Of the past, how many bogus nostrums
may be numbered! Beginning their ca
reers with a tremendous flourish of trum
pets, blazoned for a time in the public
prints, and on flaming posters, soon, but
not too soon, were they relegated to the
limbo of things lost on earth. But Hos
tetter's Stomach Bitters is a living and
thriving remedy. It goes on, curing and
to cure. Neither underhand nor open
competition oflect it. On the contrary,
contrast with inferior rival preparations
only increases its popularity. It has been
repeatedly imitated, without success.
Counterfeits of it have been surreptitious
ly introduced, but have fallen flat. Ev
erywhere it entrenches itaslf in the confi
dence of the people;- and well it may, for
it is a thoroughly reliable invigorant of
the feeble, banishee dyspepsia and con
stipation, braces the nerves, cures rhen
matic ailments and kidney complafnts,
and eradicates and prevents intermittent
and remittent fever.
Seantor Sandiford.
The N. 0. Democrat reporter puts
hMr. Sandiford down as saying :
When qnestioled Oin the sn1lject, said
that he did not believe a greater elanhni
ty could fall Il)on the State thaln t l fli
holding of an election at the present time10
for mnllters of a constitntional conIven- n.
tion. In the country the jIeople, at, least ",
the thinking peop'le, were opposed to the
imovemenit, and it was ranrely that a lper
son could heI met who favored it. The it,
people are tired of pollitics, and an e'lec- i
tion in the sliri ig, coning so near that
which will I, held in the fall for State
'I'reasurer, would militate much against
their interests. As things now a:ro-the 3
negro is fist growinr :raathetic as to pol
itics, having a strong feeling of lpeict; to
security as to his rights under the pre- "'
sent idministrationil-n leehtiuni would1 T1
only serve to distract themn front their n
, uIrsnits. fit
If Mr. Sandiford ays thallt "rarely
a person (thinking plelon) can be
met with who favors a convention,'
lie has either renained at home to v
keep from meeting "tlhinking peo- m1
pie" or else he willfully umistates facts. te
Mi. Hall, District Attorney of the
district and a resident of DeSoto par- ii1
