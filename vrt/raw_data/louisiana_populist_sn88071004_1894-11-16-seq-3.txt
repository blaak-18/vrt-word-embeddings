wife of the lkte S. W. Kile, aged
72 years.
Mrs. Kile has been an invalid for

"Clouds Pinned Back With a
Star."
Dr. Alphonse DeSeay will deliv
er his interesting lecture, entitled
"Clouds Pinned Back With a Star,"
at the Comus Club, on Friday,
November 23rd, at 8 p. in.
Dr. DeSeay is delivering this
lecture throughout the State for
the purpose of raising funds for
the construction of a Science Hall
at the Louisiana Chautauqua. The
object of this lecture will appeal
strongly to the people of our city.
Natchitoches has always been a
friend of the chautauqua, and will,
upon this occasion, no doubt sns
tain its reputation as a centre of
educational movements tending to
the betterment of our educational
system. Let the home of the Nor
mal respond to this appeal in a
manner that will uphold its past
record in educational matters.
In addition to the lecture, a mu.
sical programme will be rendered
by local talent and students of the
Normal school.
General price of admission is
fifty cents. Students of the Nor
mal and Grammar schools and
Convent, will be admitted for 25
cents.
A prominent democrat in these
"diggins" was chiding his brother

Cleveland badge: my elbows and
knees sticking out, three different
colored patches oa my pants and a
stick in the rim of my hat to keep
it from flopping off."
The death of Mr. Remy W. Har.
kins which occurred at bis resi
dence on Jefferson street Wednes
day morning, cast a feeling of deep
regret among his many friends.
His mortal remains were interred
in the Catholic cemetery, and fol
lowed to their last resting place by
a large concourse of sorrowful rela
tives and friends. The POPULIST
extends its heartfelt sympathies to
the bereaved ones.

We wish to call the attention of our
readers, who wish to take a great na
tional paper, great in every depart
ment, to the American Nonconformist
No Populist paper has so many able
correspondents or so large a circulation.
And its success is deserved, as no ex
pense is spared to make it the best,
most readable paper in the country.
The fraud and rascality (winked at and
unpublished by the old party papers),
unearthed and exposed by its Washing
ton correspondents during the last ses
sion of congress was a revelation to
every honest man. Its scathing and
fearless editorials are a terror to evil
doors. Every one of our readers who
wishes the news of the whole Populist
movement should subscribe for this
great paper. Price $1.00 a year. Send
direct to Indianapolis, Ind. Sample
copy sent upon request.
