Sketches from Roman History
The warfare that is being carried on
today against class legislation has
aroused a keen interest in this little
book, in which Mr. Watson deals with
the heroic land reformers of Rome,
the great slave revolt, the tribune of
the people, the brilliant leader of the
aristocrats, and other dramatic scenes
in the history of Rome.

‘‘Jim, it ain’t right fer er father
an’ son ter mix.”
“1 know that, pap, an’ that’s why
I’m givin’ ver fa’r warnin’. That's
all I’ve got ter say on the present
tex’.”
Emily grew weaker day by day.
One evening while the girl was lying
on the bed, Mrs. Gate wood, after fin
ishing her melancholy song, stealthily
came to her.
“Ma, I don’t b’lieve I’ll ever git
up no mo’.”
“Please don’t talk I hater way,
precious. Yer’ll be well airter while,
an’ then we’ll git on er hoss an’ ride
way over ter the mill an’ eat dinner
at Frazier’s.”
The girl remained silent for a few
moments; then she said: “I ain’t
erfeard, ma. I don’t belong to the
church, but I don’t b’lieve the Lawd
would punish sich er po’ little thing
ez I am. Thar, ma, please don’t cry.
Here comes pap.”
“How do yer feel?” asked the old
man, entering the room.
“I’m erfeard that I don’t feel ez
well ez I oughter, pap.”
“Yer oughter shake yerse’f er
little. I’d feel bad, too, es I didn’t
stir ’round none.”
Emily did not get up the next
morning. She had had a very bad
night and had, when she thought that
her father was asleep, called her
mother. Late in the afternoon Mrs.
Gatewood hurried out to the field
where Jim andfher husband were at
work.
“Pap,” she breathlessly said, “I
want yer an’ Jim ter come ter the
house. Em is a-dyiu’.”
The old man, without replying, sul
lenly followed her. Jim, harnessing
a horse to an old spring wagon, drove
rapidly away.
Gatewood sat down near the bed
and gazed on in silence. The heart
broken mother hid her face in an
apron which she took down from a
nail.
“What 'pears ter be the matter,
WHO WILL HELP US?
Under the above heading last week
we had a short article calling atten
tion to the fact that the people were
dominated by public service corpora
tions, and in that issue we promised
to show the people how to get out
from under the domination of the op
pressive public service corporations
which we hope to make plain.
In the first place, and to begin with,
let us understand what we have got
to contend with, and then in the sec
ond place, consider how we are going
to proceed, or, in other words, just
how we are going to proceed to cause
those public service corporations to
let go of us when they and everyone
who has the ordinary reasoning fac
ulty of a very ordinary human being,
knows that those corporations exist
by reason of legal powers that have
been conferred upon them from time
to time by the legally constituted
agents of the people, the sovereigns
of the nation, states and municipali
ties which signed. sealed and deliv
ered these franchises, complying wi|h

(§§□)
Em?” the old man at length asked.
“I don’t know, sir, but I b’lieve
that I’m dyin’. I kain’t help it,”
fearing that she had offended her
father.
“Whar’s Sue?” Gatewood asked,
turning to his wife.
“She couldn’t stan’ it no longer,
an’ has gone up-stairs.”
“Ma,” said the girl, “ain’t it
turnin’ awful cold?”
“No, darlin’.”
“Why don’t the sun shine?”
“It is. Don’t you see it on the
bed?”
“Yes, now I do, but it looks cold.
Pap, yer ain’t mad at me, air yer?”
“No, child,” the old man replied,
shivering convulsively. “Em,” he
staid, arising and tottering toward
her, “I didn’t know yer wuz so sick.
No, I didn’t,” taking her hand and
dropping it with a shudder. “I wuz
thinkin’ so much erbout my work
that I couldn’t think erbout nuthin*
else.”
The shadows had grown long when
a wagon stopped near the door. The
next moment Jim appeared with
Balkin in his arms. He placed his
burden on the floor. The school
master placed his head on the dying
girl’s pillow. A breeze, coming
through the open window, waved her
beautiful hair in his face.
“Jim,” the girl whispered, “put
my hands on his head. “There, that
will do. I knowed yer would come
back ter me,” she said. “Ma, kiss
me.”
A deep silence fell upon the scene.
Jim lighted a candle. The girl and
the teacher were dead. Sue appeared
in the doorway. Her hair hung loose
and her eyes were wild in expression.
Pointing a long, bony finger at the
old man she said: “Yer won’t have
no mo’ widders in the house.”
'Several days ago, while passing
through the Arkansas insane asylum,
an old man with squint eyes and
grizzled whiskers attracted my atten
tion. I spoke to him, and, tottering
toward me, he caught my hand,
dropped it with a. shudder, turned
away and muttered: “No mo’ widders
in the house.”
all the legal forms of a contract in
the conveyance of title to an estate,
goods and chattels of the citizen is
valid.
The courts have decided such fran
chises are a contract. How, if they
were honest, could they decide other
wise? The agents of the people, in
making this contract, have not made
specific reservation in said contract
since the people have parted with
their sovereign rights to eminent do
main, which would now prevent the
people or their lawful representatives
at this time from assuming sovereign
rights or regulate the rates of public
service corporations or in any of their
modus operandi. Not a bit of it. If
the people’s representatives, when
they entered into those contracts
(franchise) had said, We, the party
of the first part reserve the right to

would have been valid, but when they
