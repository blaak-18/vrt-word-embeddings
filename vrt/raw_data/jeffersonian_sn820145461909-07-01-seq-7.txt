under the banner of reform, and car
ry our colors, to a glorious victory at
the ballot box in 1912.
From reading the Jeffersonians, I
must congratulate you on the success
of the good seed they have sown in
bringing good men and women into
the ranks of reform. Enclosed find
P. O. order for sl, to be used as you
think best. I could use some copies
of the Weekly of date May 6th if you
have them.

THE QUESTIONS ARE OLD ONES.
Watson’s Jeffersonian:—l see in
your June issue an able and elabo
rate discussion of two troublesome
.questions in Foreign Missions. You
speak of discussing another phase of
the work in the next issue. Before
leaving this some of us would be glad
for you to give a solution of these
two questions. They have attracted
attention from the days of Christ and
His Apostles to the present day. We
would be glad to get them settled
some way if it can be done and the
work go on successfully.
1. The first of these questions is
that the Orientals may be induced to
become professors of religion simply
for the pay that is in it.
This same thing confronted Christ.
After He had fed the five thousand
(see John 6:5-13) they followed Him
even to the crossing of the sea. He
said (verse 26), “Ye seek Me, not be
cause ye saw the miracles, but be
cause ye did eat the loaves and were
filled.” He proceeded at once to in
struct them, which I suppose our mis
sionaries do under similar circum
stances. We frequently hear it said
that people in this Christian land
make profession of religion for gain.
So there is nothing new in the heath
en doing the same thing. But the
question is, can you give us a solu
tion? We are all acquainted with
the fact but have never known how
to prevent it.
2. The second question you dis
cuss is the enormous expense of car
rying on the work while we have
such need at home. Our Savior was
confronted by this also. After Mary
had anointed the Saviour’s feet at
considerable expense (see John
12:3-8) Judas wanted to know why
it should be done in the place of
looking after the poor and our Sa
viour said we would always have the
poor with us (see also Matt.
26:6-13). In other words, He was
confronted by the same spirit of com
plaint against extravagance as we.
So there is nothing new in hearing
the complaint. What we want is the
remedy, that will meet the wishes of
everybody. Can you give it?
Fraternally,
M. K. THOMTON.

THIS LETTER IS A REAL
PLEASURE.
Dear Sir:—Have just received my
Magazine for June. It is simply fine.
A friend approached me some few
days ago and asked if I were still
taking the Watson publications. I
replied that I was, and would con
tinue to do so until the price goes to
$lO per year—and then if I could
scratch up the $lO my name would
still be on your mailing list.
It is being talked that you are to
speak at the Horse Shoe Bend, Talla
poosa County, July 3. In fact, I no
ticed a piece in the Age-Herald to
that effect. Please write me if it is
true.
You will please send your publica
tions to the persons named below. I
am not charging any commission, but
if this entitles me to a knife send it
along. Very truly,
A. W. STONE.
Talladega, Ala.
(The report that Mr. Watson will
speak at Horse Shoe Bend July 3rd
is an error, the circulation of which
we cannot account for. —Ed.)
Dear Sir:—Find enclosed in sep
arate wrapper of Mr. Nulley for
which you can reproduce it; return
when you get through with it. Please
send me copy of paper.
Yours truly,
C. M. HENDERSON.

FOREIGN MISSIONS AGAIN.
Dear Sir:—l wish to say to you
that I read with much interest your
article on Foreign Missions, and look
forward to the edition that contains
comment upon “The Viciousness of
the Board and Home Support Sys
tem.”
I am quite sure that you are be
ing condemned because you are like
ly to put a check upon the “rake off”
that so many of the insiders are heir
to now. “L glory in your spunk.”
Very respectfully,
G. E. HODGES.

A FARMER AT ELEVEN YEARS
OF AGE.
Dear Sir:—l have received your
Magazine that I subscribed for on
the 20th of April last; it is inter
esting and very instructive to me. I
have read it through carefully.
There is a vacation in our school
until July next, consequently, Pa has
put me to plowing. The mule walks
rather fast, and about 11 o’clock a.
m. she gets me rather warm. I love
to farm. I will soon be 11 years old.
If - you will send me some sample
copies of the Jeffersonian and Maga
zine I will try to get up subscriptions
for them. I have received the pre
mium knife. It is a beauty and treat
for me. I have put it away, for fear
of losing it, but when I solicit sub
scriptions I will show it.
With best wishes and kind regards,
I am your namesake,
THOS. WATSON SMITH.

OCALA PLATFORM CAN’T BE
BEAT.
Dear Sir: —I want to express my
gratitude for the stand you have al
ways taken for the laboring class. I
am one of the old guards who has
been in the fight for reform for
twenty years. Was one of the Alli
ance men who indorsed the Alliance
platform. I see many suggestions as
to organizing. This is the thing to
do, and the Ocala platform has never
been beat, and I think this should
be printed and get it circulated thor
oughly throughout the country. We
will all scatter it among the people-
This is yet popular if the Pops are
not.
But I tell you, Mr. Watson, the
tSlje Jeffersonian
people will listen now, better than in
a heated campaign.
If we could only get them to sub
scribe for your Jeffersonians! I
heartily indorse your stand on Mis
sions. And those parsons that have
been on the firing lines against you,
—I think they had better crawl in a
hole and pull the hole in after
them. They remind me of a little
boy playing with a man. But I am
so glad you have exposed them.
Their sins have overtaken them and
will go before them to Judgment.
Very truly yours,
L. J. OVERSTREET.
Tifton, Ga.
IT’S THE TRUTH THAT HURTS.
Dear Sir: —It does me so much
good the way you are skinning those
parsons I have got to say something.
The big fish have quit biting at you,
it’s nothing now but the minnows,
and as soon as they have sense
enough to know they are skinned
they will take to shallow water.
Keep telling it to them; you know it
is the truth that hurts.

OLD GUARD POP BY GRACE OF
CONVICTION.
My Dear Sir: Have received
yours of 28th ult.
The plan I have in mind appears
to me to be the most natural and
practical one to initiate and consum
mate the political reformation pre
scribed in our Jeffersonian creed.
My faith is in the common people,
composed of the industrial classes, —
the rank and file of all parties. In
this element the spirit of ’76, appar
ently dormant, still lives. According
to my conception, the proper thing
to do is: To arouse, unify and so
lidify that dormant spirit of patriot
ism. Do this; —organize the indi
vidual parties into one vast army
ready for mobilization and fight, and,
when the crisis demanding action is
reached, they willl sweep away every
Barrier reared by venal minds and
perfidious hands since 1783. The ad
monitions of history should be our
guide,—our “pillar of cloud by day,”
—our “pillar of fire by night.”
Hoping there is ample compensa
tion in the womb of the future for
the Jeffersonians’ masterly stand on
every question of general interest, I
am, while a true American and vet
eran-rebel, also an old guard Pop by
the grace of conviction.
Yours truly,
P. H. LAREY.

FROM A GOOD TOOMBS COUNTY
POPULIST.
Dear Sir: —As I hardly ever see
anything in the Jeffersonian from
Toombs County, I thought I would
write a few lines and let you know
that the Populists are not all dead in
Toombs County. We have a great
many strong Populists left who are,
like myself, so hard pressed by the
money power that they are kept un
der to some extent, but we look and
hope for a brighter day ahead.
You will find enclosed money or
der for $1 for which please renew
my subscription to the Weekly Jef
fersonian, and if I am entitled to a
photo-knife, please send it to me and
J will greatly appreciate it.
I have been with you, and a be-
liever in Populist principles for fif
teen years, and expect to die a Popu
list.
Hoping you great success, in your
labors for the laboring class, I re
main,
Sincerely your friend,
B. A. GANUS.
