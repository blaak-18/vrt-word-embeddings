ihll or pra yer cure Is one of the es
sential tenomtu of the Dowie creed. Dr.
Dowie and his followers were admit
ted to bail when arraigned in the crim
inal court, ani the case goes before the
Cook county grand jury. The arrest
does not seem to have lessened the
activity of the "overseer" of the Chris
tian Catholic church, as Dowtle styles
himself, his energies being just now
especially directed toward the build
ing of the new city of Zion, near Wau
kegan. Ills., on the shores of Lake
Michigan.
If present plans are carried out, this
will be a unique religious and Iindus
trial community. Dr. Dowle says that
for some time he had entertained the
"plan for the establishment of a mod
ern city -which should rehabilitate the
pristine glories of Zion and be a model
to all cities the world over. I broach
ed the plan to some friends and found
that it struck a sympathetic chord. An
agitation started, a society was organ
ised, offers of financial assistance pour
ed in from ail over the country, and In
a miraculously short space of time
what at first had ueemed even to me
as a plan too beneficent, too farreach
ing in its good results, was an accom
plished fact. From the Mart I saw
clearly that the new Zion to be perma
nent would necessarily have to be built
on sound foundations and be self sup
porting.
"To that end, in addition to consider
ing the religious element of daily life,
we shall cater to the industrial and will
erect several great factories, including
one for the making of lace and another
for the manufacture of shoes. Only
residents of the town will receive em
ployment, and all the profits will re
vert to the public exchequer. No in
dividual will receive more than his per
capita share as resident of the accru
ing receipts of these enterprises. The
site selected for the new city came as
a divine revelation, and for that rea
son we did not hesitate to pay enor
mous prices in order to secure control
of all available land."
The site of the proposed city of Zion
embraces a tr: ct of 6,54X0 acres, having
a frontage of two miles on the lake and
extending westward five miles. Aside
from the erection of a few scattered
and rather roughly constructed frame
buildings, little has yet been done to
ward the creation of the beautiful city
shown in the elaborate iowie plans.
The real estate, however, is here for it,
and there are sotne evidences that a
start is to be made in earnest toward
its construction. Since tlw opening of
spring surveyors have been engaged
plotting the tract, apd their work is
now substantially compieted. Large
gangs of men, with the most approc ed
roadmnaking equilutnett, are at work
grading the stret'h and avenues. The
llans provide for a broad highway run
ning through the entire length of the
tract. witli cros'- and parallel streets at
convenient distances, while from the
four corners avenues will run dingo
nally to the center of the plot, where
will 'e built the groat temple which is
to be the crowning teature of the whole
plant. It will be a replica of the
mosque of Omar, which stands on the
site of Solomon's temple, in Jerusalem.
The building will be octagonal, and
the walls will contain no windcws,
light being provided for by the glass
dome which surmounts the structure
after the manner of the mosque. The
material is to be marble, with copings
of tile beneath the dome. As on the
tiles of the mosque are-inscribed the
passages of the Koran, so on the cop

A corps of girls iemployed'l asi waitresses
and clinimbrniialds there have a hoime
in a two story frame structure about a
block away, which is used for their
shleeping quarters. These two build
ings are painted white, with brown
trimmings, and represent the acme of
architeeture up to d(late in Zion City.
Most of the life of the colony now
centers aboift the tracks of the Chicago
and Northwestern railway, upon the
line of which Zion City is located. A
freighthouse .300 feet long, a little de
pot maybe six feet square, with a tele
graph operator in it; the saw and plan
Ing mill. an office building about 12
feet square and an engine house and
electric light plant are ranged along the
track.
Not far distant is the Zion general
store building, a rather neat two story
frame, in which a line of general mer
chandise is carried and where the
faithful do their trading. There is one
article, however, that is not dealt in at
the Zion general store, and that is to
bacco. An inquiry for cigars brought a
look of horror to the face of a genial
young man who appeared to be guiding
the store's destinies, and he hastily
said that tobacco was a curse, and Dr.
Dowit abhorred It. And this is another
noticeable thing about Zion City. Of
the hundred or more men working
there not one can be seen smoking or
chewing, so it is evident that they sub
scribe' to the doetor's belief on this
point.
Within a block of the general store
and on the same side of the Sheridan
road is a handsome country residence.
Costly lace curtains hang at the win
dows, and the furniture and ornaments,
what can be seen of them from the out
side, denote luxury and good taste.
Beaatiful trees dot the wide grounds,
and a group of men were busily sod
ding thy lawn that runs down to the
roadway. This is Dr. Dowle's home
when he comes to Zion, and it is kept
ready fcr his arrival at any moment.
The house is not an erection of the doc
tor's, but was on the property when he
bought it.
The people already gath'red at Zion
are mainly foreigners-English, Scotch,

ly. .1 spirit of cheerfulness and cl nfil
dence in the future of the city seems to
thoriughly pert alt these pc opue, who
are all de otnd adherents of Dowieism.
They put explicit and unquestioning
faith in John Alexander iowie, both in
spiritual and temporal matters, and re
gard him as a divinely inspired leader
and teacher, priest, prophet and physi
clan. No autocrat could have more
power and authority than that with
which the followers of Dr. Dowie vol
untarily clothe him. He is the supreme
head of this prospective "Holy City."
