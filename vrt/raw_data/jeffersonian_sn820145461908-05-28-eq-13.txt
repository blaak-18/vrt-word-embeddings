“Get your reforms inside the Demo
cratic Party.”
Yes. that’s what they said to us. And
then they made a new rule, which was
meant to prevent us from getting any.
We ought to have had better sense
than to think they would tote fair, but
we didn’t.
Fooled us, slick as a whistle.
But they’ll be early risers when they
do it again.
Under that new rule, the Populists
have no chance to do anything in the
Democratic party. As Hoke and his
lieutenants had to revolutionize the vot
ing system to guard against our having
our constitutional share of power, we are
done. We will work from the outside,
hereafter. If country Democrats can
stomach that new rule, they are free to
do it; but we old Pops will never submit
to such an outrage.
We Pops are going back to our own
house.
When Hoke and his lieutenants invited
us to visit them and stay awhile, we ex
pected better treatment than this. But
never mind; we have a house of our own,
and we are going to it. We are going to
invite the real Democrats, the fair and
square Democrats, to come along with
us. We promist to treat them white. We
promise that WE will not invent new
rules for the purpose of stabbing our own
allies.
If you should happen to want any red
eye, bug juice, rot erit, or any other brand
of fire-water, be sure to consult Hoke’s
Atlanta organ. The Journal will tell you
what places in Chattanooga and Jackson
ville make a specialty of shipping these
liquid refreshments into Georgia. Never
have we known a prohibition newspaper
that was fonder of whiskey ads. than The
Journal. We don’t seem to see any ad
vertisements of “light wines and beer.”
Just plain whiskey. And oodles of it.
Our readers will be disappointed when
we inform them, as it becomes our pain
ful duty to do so, that neither Hoke
Smith nor Bob Park has explained why
they violated the law in of the Neal
bank.
Hoke and Bob are maintaining, on this
subject, one of those silences which you
may call oppressive. Not a word to say
on the subject has either Hoke or Bob.
Yet the law was violated, and the two
sworn officials who busted the statute
are lawyers bv profession.
The most charitable explanation is that
they did not know the law.
Yet the poorest, most illiterate citizen
of the state is not heard to make that
excuse when he has broken the law.
Hereafter, when we elect lawyers to
office, it might be advisable to send them
to a law-school a few months, prepara
tory to their entrance upon their high
and solemn duties.
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
“Like a cat shot in the ear with hot
soup,” was the comparison which the old
people used to make, when they wished
to give a life-like description of the man
ner in which some excited person was
hopping about, dancing around, and cut
ting up galvanic capers, generally.
First, picture to your mind the doings
of that “cat shot in the ear with hot soup”
and then look at the Governor !
“Such a getting up stairs I never did
see,” and to think that it is all caused by
a modest little man who was carefully
selected as the safest man to kick.
If Uncle Obadiah Stevens is a worse
man to kick than Joe Brown has proven
to be, there “sure” would have been an
earthquake, seasoned with cyclones, if
Hoke had kicked Uncle Obe.
If a small animal, that a bull dog had
taken to be a rabbit, had walked up to the
dog and smacked him, good and hard, on
the jaw, we imagine that the consterna
tion of the bull dog would not have been
greater than that of Hoke Smith when
Little Joe Brown threw at his feet the
gage of battle in this Gubernatorial race.
It isn’t everything which, at a distance, is
taken to be a rabbit that is a rabbit.
It’s an awful thing to make a mistake
on this line, whether in Zoology or poli
tics.

The lordly eagle, soaring in his pride
and strength, looks down on the moun
tains below and sees what he takes to be
a rabbit, or wood-rat. The eagle swoops
from above, pounces upon the supposed
wood-rat, and flies aloft with it.
But, great heavens! the eagle has made
a mistake; it is a weasel he has caught!
The despised little creature that wasn’t
doing a thing to that eagle, now fights
for his life, as the eagle rises in the air.
The. eagle is strong in his way, but the
weasel is strong in his. After a desperate
struggle, the weasel his powerful
jaws fixed on the neck of the eacle, and
soon the cruel King of birds is faint from
loss of blood and slowly sinks to earth,
his life ebbing away.
Moral: It isn’t every little animal
which, at a distance, appears to be a rab
bit that is a rabbit, and the biggest of
birds comes to grief when he takes a
weasel to be a rabbit.

Headache, rheumatism,

on the nerves. Almost
instant relief can be ob
tained by taking Dr. Miles

out any bad after-effects.
Take one on first indica
tion of an attack—it will
ward it off. They are a

“I was subject to constant head
aches for a period of four years. At
times I was almost unfitted for the
work rn which I am engaged, that of
station agent. Through the advice
of a friend I tried Dr. Miles’ Anti-
Paln Pills, and the result has been
that I have entirely eradicated my
system of those continuous headaches
that follow a continual mental strain.
They have done for me all that is
claimed for them.”
