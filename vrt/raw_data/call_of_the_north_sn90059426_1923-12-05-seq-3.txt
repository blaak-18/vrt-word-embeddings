The History of the Monroe Doctrine
Next to the glorious Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution of
the United States, the Monroe Doc
trine is America’s most important
and significant contribution to the
well-being and progress of humanity.
The doctrine itself is not easy to
define. It is not embodied in a speci
fic document like Magna Charta, the
Virginia Bill of Rights or the Declar
ation of Independence. Even in Pres
ident Monroe’s message to congress
of December 2, 1823, in which he first
gives official declaration of the doc
trine that bears Jus name, and that
was destined to profoundly,, influence
the history of mankind for a century,
the tenets are not definitely formu
lated. Rather, President Monroe gave
expression to the idea and the ex
igencies of events gave difinition,
force and concrete form to the new
principles of international relation
ship.
To understand the full meaning of
this tremendously significant doctrine
it is necessary to Consider it in the
fight of contemporary events, to see
it in its historical setting. From a
world standpoint it is one of a series
of the most dramatic and spectacular
events in human history!!
COLO.
The League of Despots
In May, 1814, Napoleon abdicated
At Waterloo, June 15, 1815, Bone
parte’s star of destiny set in a sea
of blood. The Napoleonic wars left
Europe demoralized and exhausted.
Dynasties had tottered, nations had
been disrupted, economic and political
institutions were _in a state of
collapse. The fall of Boneparte re
moved the peril of French imperial
ism, but left the continent in a state
of social, economic and governmental
confusion.
At the Congress of Vienna the vic
tors met to reorganize international
relations, re-establish solial and po
litical institutions and bring order
out of the prevailing chaos.
Twenty years before, the French
Revolution with its cries of liberty,
fraternity and equality, its clamor for
justice and democracy, its wild ex
cesses and resultant anarchy, had
filled the nations with alarm and b©-
wilderment. Not a throne in Europe
but had shuddered as a result of the
social cataclysm at Paris. The kings
feared. The oppressed and down
trodden people hoped.
The demoralized conditions follow
ing Jena, Wagram, Austerlitz and
Waterloo furnished thfe psychological
moment, the supreme opportunity for
the absolutions of Europe.
At Vienna they met: Alexander,
autocrat of autocrats, powerful,
proud, domineering; Mettemich,
cynical, shifty, unscrupulous; Tally
rand, too well versed in all the du
bious arts of Machiavellian diploma
cy; Castereagh of England, narrow,
and partisan, easy dupe of the crafty
Metternich; and the representatives
of a dozen lesser powers and princi
palities. It was a brilliant and mar
velous assembly of kings, princelings
and diplomats, bvd such an ill-assort
ed gathering must inevitably break
up into warring cliques and clashing
antipathies.
The great powers—Russia, Prussia,
Austria and Great Britain, formed
the Quadruple'Alliance to bring about
the reconstruction of France and as
aure the peace of Europe by estab
lishing the ancient laws and institu
tions. England could not
continue in an alliance dominated by
Russia, Prussia and Austria, and
when an effort was made to use the
power of the alliance to crush popu
lar revolutions in Naples and Spain,
England in 1819, withdrew from the
obligations that had become, hateful
to the English people.
The Quadruple Alliance held a con
ference at Verona in 1822 at which
time King Ferdinand VII of Spain re
quested aid of the alliance in dealing
with Spain’s American colonies, in
rebellion. One of the sentiments
adopted was: “The manarchs (are)
determined on replusing the spirit, of
revolt in whatever place or iff what
ever form it might show itself.”
Upon the withdrawal of. England,
the Tsar, the Emperor of Austria and
the King of Prussia, now freed from
the restraining hand of England,
formed what was known as. the Holy
Alliance, to maintain the principles
of absolutism, protect the powers
and prerogatives of reigning dynas
ties, and check the rising tide of li
beralism. Its merciless antagonism
to aU movements seeking to give the
burdened peoples some measure of re
lief earned for the alliance the name:
the league of despots.
Having frustrated the attempt of
a republic in Spain, put down the re
bellion in Italy, and otherwise sub
dued continental Europe to its will,
the autocratic- alliance turned its eyes
to the American continent where
there was in progress the greatest
experiment in popular government
and democratic control.
Encouraged by the amazing eue
eess of the North American colonies
in throwing off the yoke of England
and establishing a sound and stable
government, the 'Spanish colonies of
Central and South America were
striking for freedom against the tyr
anny of Spain. Several of the Latin
nations had already achieved their
independence and the other colonies
wers seething with revolution.
United States Defending Liberty •
In 1812 the United States had
recognized the independence of the
newly established republics of South
America and had appointed diplo
matic representatives to their gov
ernments. Thereby the young repub
lic of the North fairly and squarely
aligned herself with the lusty young
democracies of the South.
For a moment let us glance at con
ditions in the United States. All was
not well. Internally the people were
not united. On questions of foreign
policy nation was split asunder. One
group demanded that the government
cease all connections with or interest
in foreign affairs, self-sufficient let
the nation carve put its destiny with
qut any outside Entanglements. The
other party, seeing the popular insti
tutions of the newly created republics
imperilled, pleaded that the United
States throw the weight of her in
fluence and force on the side of re
publicanism against the machinations
of European autocracies.
Foreign relations were in a danger
ous condition. Russia disputed the
right of the United States to posses
sion of Oregon, the fabulously rich
territory recently explored by Lewis
and Clark, and extended her claim of
sovereignty over the Mexican prov
ince of California, establishing an
outpost as, far south as Fort Bodega,
a few miles north of San Francisco
Bay. With inconceivable arrogance
the Tsar made claim to Bering Sea,
forbidding the subjects of all other
nations to approach within a hundred
miles of the Pacific Coast, thus mak
ing the north Pacific a Russian lake.
Spain acting with France had
sought to prevent the expansion of
the United States beyond the Alle
ghanies. Even after the ceding -of the
vast territory of Louisiana to France
by the treaty of San Ildefonso in
1800, Spain continued to act with
France in preventing the natural and
inveitable development of American
authority and influence. Spain’s at
titude was particularly offensive and
America was compelled to occupy
West Florida in 1812 and again in
1818. • - , : '
And back of all these diplomatic
collisions loomed the sinister shadow
of the Holy Alliance, with its avowed
purpose of crushing liberal ideas,
overthrowing the new republics and
establishing again political institu
tions based upon the divine right of
kings.
The Holy Alliance
It was not a mhre euphemism that
the Alliance was called Holy. It had
an authentic religious character.
While it included the King of Prussia,
a confessed Protestant Monarch, it
was dominated by the Tsar, the head
of the autocratic Greek Orthodox
Church, and with the Emperor of
Austria, the most Catholic of all
Catholic sovereigns, stood by the
King of Spain, who held his crown by
the grace of the Pope, and all the pet
ty kings and princelings yielding ec
clesiastical obedience to Rome. The
whole enterprise was 'conducted with
the open approval, sanction and sup
port of the Vatican. ' *
In all ages, monarchial despotism
and ecclesiastical authority have gone
hand in hand. Whether it be King
John of England defying his barons
and repudiating his solemn pledges in
Magna Charta, or Alexander, Fred
erick and Metternich scheming to
dam the swellin gtides of popular
government in the early part of the
nineteenth century, the cloudy diplo
macy of the Vatican has ever been on
the side of autocracy and oppression.
This then was America’s situation.
Torn by domestic discord, surrounded
by bitter and rapacious enemies men
aced by a powerful diplomatic com
bination made holy by papal blessing,
the questions arose: what was her
duty with regard to the sacred prin
ciples of righteousness and d&nocra
cy committed to her care; what was
her duty with relation to the strug
gling republics to the south piteously
appealing for succor and moral sup
port; what attitude should she take
toward the powerful nations and in
terests allied against her; where
should she find friends in the mighty
conflict impending?
While Europe was being rocked
with the Napoleonic wars, and the up
heavals that followed in their train,
and events of far-reaching influence
had taken place on the American con
tinent, changes almost revolutionary
had transpired in England. The old
German-speaking autocrat, King
George 111 was dead, as were Lord
North and all the other Georgian min
isters whose stubborn imbecility had
cost the British Empire the fairest
jewel in the crown. Gradually the
spirit of the government had become
broad, liberal and humanitarian.
Gastereagh, reactionary and insu
lar, had given place to George Can
ning in 1822 as British Foreign Min
ister. Canning was a statesman of
most liberal sympathies and far-see
ing vision. With keen prescience he
discerned the trend of events and saw
the forces lining up the world over
between the discredited absolutisms
of the past and the splendid human
itarianisms of the future. He pene
trated the iniquitous designs, the
dark motives, the ruthless purposes of
the Holy Alliance. There was no
doubt in his mind with whom the
England of the Magna Charts, of
Cromwell, Harry Vane, and Hamp
den should stand. He saw; also that
the strategic point in the titanic
The CALL OF THE NORTH
Reynold E. Blight
struggle was to be in the western
hemisphere.
On August 20, 1823, Canning ap
proached Benjamin Kush, United
States minister at London and sug
gested that Englapd and the United
States enter into an agreement to
recognize the independence of the
South American republics and an
nounce to the world a treaty that
would have embodied the principles
later known under the name of the
Monroe DoctririL
For some time American statesmen
had realized that a reapproachment
with England was inevitable. When
the secret treaty of San „ Ildefonso
(1800) between France and Spain
leaked out, Thomas Jefferson frankly
declared that the day France took
possession of New Orleans, the- Unit
ed States must join herself to Great
Britain. “From that moment,” he
said, “we must marry ourseiyes to the
British fleet and nation.”
When Canning’s proposal to Rush
became known, Jefferson in a letter
to President Monroe, said: “Eng
land “now offers to lead, aid'and ac
company us in it. By acceding to her
proposition, we detach her from the
bands, bring her mighty weight into
the scale of free government and em
ancipate a continent at one stroke
which might otherwise linger long in
doubt and difficulty. Great Britain
one nation that can do us the
most harm of anyone, or all on
earth; and with her on our side ws
need not fear the whole world.”
President Monroe preferred to
make the issue purely an .American
one. In this desire many American
leaders supported him. John Qnincy
Adams declared that he did not care
to see “his country come in as a
cock-boat in the wake of the British
man-or-war.”
Challenge to Autocracy
This sentiment was communicated
to the British government, and Can
ning stepped aside, giving the lead
ership to President Monroe, who in
his famous address to Congress, De>-
cember 2, 1823,. asserted the principle
that the American continents, by vir
tue of the free and independent posi
tion which they have assumed and
maintained are henceforth not to be
considered as subjects for future col
onization by an European power.
Ostensibly the suave diplomatic
phrases in which the message was
oouched merely meant a limitation of
European power and influence in the
western hemisphere. In fact, it was
a ringing restatement of the Declara
tion of Independence, including not
one nation only, but all the little na
tions fighting splendidly for freedom
and the right of self-determination.
The promulation of the new doc
trine threw costernation into the
chancellories of Europe. It was more
than a proclamation of defence, it
was a bold and audacious challenge
to all existing autocracies in the name
of republicanism, liberty and popular
rights. Immediately Canning served
notice upon Europe that the power of
Great Britain was squarely behind
the American president and the new
principles he had enunciated; and
that in an appeal to force the army
and navy of Britain would be found
fighting with the military and naval
forces of. the young republic.
The legitimist diplomats gnashed
their teeth and fumed; but they did
not dare challenge the combined
might and power of the English
speaking democracies; .the first spec
tacular example of the compelling
forae of Great Britain and America
acting together in defense of a right
eous cause.
The alliances born of the wars of
Napoleon fell apart like houses of
sand. New cleavages re-aligned the
nations. It made possible a rebirth of
liberty.
The British people gave enthusias
tic support to their government, and
Canning boasted in Parliment that he
had “called in the £Jew World to re
dress the balance of the old.”
The conflict of the ancient auto
cracies and modem democracies that
lasted for a century and came to a
cataclysmic catastrophe in the World
War is a matter of history; and -that
the Monroe Doctrine and its vigor
ous maintenance has been a powerful
factor in the struggle is undisputed.
Two historic incidents, however, are
worthy of passing notice.
In 1852 the French Emperor, Louis
Napoleon, desiring to rehabilitate
hia waning prestige and fortunes cast
longing eyes toward Mexico, hoping
by a brilliant diplomatic coup -to set
Maximilian, an Austrian prince, upon
the throne and form a league of La
tin republics, of which he (Louis)
would be the dominating power. The
purpose of such an alliance, declares
a recent historian (Robert \G. de
land, in “One Hundred Years of the
Monroe Doctrine”) was to “counter
act the growing power of the Anglo-
Saxon peoples represented by tin
United States and Great Britain.
There was also an evident purpose to
strengthen the cause of the Catholic
Church in the New World, as an off
set to the growing power of Protest
antism.”
In February, 1867, Seward demand
ed that the French a definite time
of withdrawal from Mexico, and Louia
Napoleon under this pressure reluct
antly abandoned his dream of empirt
in Mexico and left Maximilian to his
fata.
A. sharp passage of notes be
tween President Cleveland and Lord
Salisbury in 1906 resulted in a new
interpretation and a wider applica
tion of the principles enunciated near
ly a century before by -Monroe.
Great Britain during the course of a
dispute with Venezuela over boundary
lines assumed a threatening and dic
tatorial attitude. With the merits of
this particular controversy we are not
concerned. Suffice it to say that as a
result of' the diplomatic exchange
which at one time nearly caused a
rupture of friendly relations, the
principle of arbitration was securely
fixed as a permanent provision of the
famous doctrine.
Battle Still On
One hundred years have passed.
The old issues and the old antagon
isms are dead. New controversies
distract the nations and new auspi
cious and misunderstandings agitata
the people. It is folly to fight over
again the wars of the past; but dis
passionately and with clear vision,
unclouded by prejudice or hate, should
we read the lessons of history.
The age-old battle against despot
isms, political and ecclesastical, is not
yet won. The ancient enemies of
mankind masquerate in new guises.
Beneath the trappings of new de
putes, look closely and you may dis
cern the mark of the beast. Metter
nich still lives among us sowing seeds
of distrust and envy, setting friend
against and making it diffi
cult for the people who believp in li
berty, progress, popular enlighten
ment and justice to work together.
Read the Monroe Doctrine again,
this time between the lines, carefully
consider it in the light of history,
mark well its principles, note well its
friends and know that in its spirit,
its altruistic objectives and its high
idealism shall be found the solution of
thp international problems that vsx
us.

THE HOUR OF OUT
WILLIAM L." STIDGER.
Morning bright, with a happy light
Swings to a new born day
Mother sings and laughter rings
As her child starts out to play.
Noon is here and mothers dear
Drift to the fields of flowers
Happy they when their children play
Through the fleeting sun-kissed
- hours.
Night is come, the crimson sun
Sinks into a golden west;
Babies lie at the end of day
In the happy arms of rest.
Shadows fall as the night-winds. eaß
And daddy comes home from the
fields.
Swift is the light in its speeding
flight
As the day ite scepter yields.
Baby’s eyes as the daylight dies
And slow in the opal west
Are sfeet to see as she waits for me
At the twilight hour of rest.
Thank God for the boon of a mother’s
croon
And a child that will wait for a
man
At the end of toil and the world’s
turmoil,
Which has been since the world
began.
Thank God for a home when the day’s
deep gloam
Spreads over the weeping west;
Thank God for the light of my hut
this night’;
For the love that is there; and for
* rest!
ill
Come forward, gallant men;
Light up your fiery crosa
To flash among the trees;
And catch the hairy moss.
Plant it in road and field;
And on the mountain high,
My heart is glad to see;
That cross against the sky.
It’s light to guide us on;
Disperse the alien horde,
Keep them from our fair land;
Guard every bridge and ford.
Keep state and church apart;
Or church will ruin the state,
Save this land of liberty;
Let depth not be its fate.
Heed not the words of hate;
But rear up brave and strong,
Only those who fear your might;
Are ones that say you’re wrong.
Ten thousand men will come;*
Ten thousand men and more,
That right alone shall rule;
As God decreed before.
Light up your fiery cross;
That good men may rejoice,
When God looks down He’ll see;
Righteousness your choice.

PRIMARY CAUSES BEHIND
THE ACTIVITIES OF K. K. K.
(By Cairoli Gigliotti, D. Sc., LL. M. Editor “The New Qomer.”)
Many newspapers, and a large agreed that it should be brought about
number of people, seem interested in as soon as possible,
the phenominal spread of the order of There may be some violence. There
the Ku Klux Klan. It is reported to may be some injustice. Present con-
have, all over the country, a mem
bership of over five million, that is,
the largest membership of any se
cret order which was ever ogranized
in this country. The Masonic order
never had a membership in excess of
three million, and the Knights of
Columbus hardly reached five hun
dred thousand up to the time the Eu
ropean war broke out. With the in
crease due to war propaganda and
the expenditure of almost thirty mil
lions, secured as its share of war
charities, the latter fraternity may
have reached, by this time, a mem
bership of three quarters of a mil
lion. v
The press, interested in subscrib
ers more than in pprinciples, has
fought the Klan. Churches, with few
exceptions, have fought it. Politicians
fearful of the influence the new pow
er may exercise in elections and pub
lic life Qf the country, have fought it.
Even those who were willing at first
to be sympathetic, have been trans
formed themselves, either in indiffer
ent bystanders or in open-'antagonists
of the new fraternity. In spite of
all this, the Klan has increased to
undreamed of proportions. Why ?
Because the general public is dissat
isfied and hopes relief in any change,
or in any new influence, which may
be instrumental in bringing it forth.
Newspapers are full of alarming
reports about collusion between poli
tics and justice. Big politicians are
at the service of big corporations and
strive to give them increased power.
The general public, be it made out of
middle class men or of farmers, is
badly used up. Conditions are be
coming worse every day. What
should people do to change them?
Rely on laws which have been in
force for years and have merely suc
ceeded in increasing the number of
crooks and in causing the cost of
living to climb sky high?
The attorney for the insurance
trust, a former governor of the state
of Illinois, and a former state’s at
torney, has tried to save insurance
companies the payment of back tax
es, following a decision of the Su
preme Court of the state which
makes them legal, on the ground that
all profits have been paid out of div
idends and thatT to force insurance
companies to pay back taxes would
be equivalent to putting them out of
business.
When private individuals are forced
to pay back taxes following unfavor
able court rulings, we do not see why
corporations should be exempted from
the payment of same only because
the equivalent amount was distribut
ed to stockholders as dividends. Stock
holders may not get a dividend for
some time to come, and make up* the
deficiency, same as private citizens
or mere political experts would be
forced to do.
Politicians are appointed to serve
corporations not because of their pro
fessional ability, but because of their
influence. Pay-rollers are scattered
all over the country and it is com
paratively easy to place a friend or
two in a jury. Citizens are generally
afraid to antagonize big business, or
big political leaders, and our juries
must be unanimous in order to decide
an issue. Acquittal is, therefore, the
inevitable outcome of every political
trial. Political lawyers get big fee?
out of their clients and the general
public is forced to foot the bill. Un
rest and dissatisfaction are a mere
consequence of political conditions and
the desire of a change is almost gen
eral.
We are poorly governed. News
papers claim that we have a govern
ment of laws. In theory, we have.
In practice, we have a government of
crooks. They are intrenched in pub
lic life and are conscienceless. They
associate with the worst element of
the population of the country and
are unwilling to surrender the ad
vantage surreptiously and criminally
secured. * -
One of our best criminal judges,
who has been the terror of criminals
during his short period of manage
ment of. the Criminal Court of the
County of Cook, Illinois, is contrib
uting to newspapers a series of ar
ticles on “Crime and the Civic Can
cer: Graft.” They reveal a condi
tion that is a shock to honest citi
zens. And reaction is almost imme
diate. Politicians are losing ground
every day and the general public feels
that something ought to be done, and
soon. •
The Knights oP the Ku Klux Klan
have been* charged with race hatred
and prejudice. Their avowed pro
gram does not include any clause
which points out to the truth of the
charge. The only thing they seem to
advocate is a “clean out” and the
separation of church and state, a
thing which has been advocated for
over a century by the greatest politi
cal thinker the world ever had: Giu
seppe Mazzini.
All impartial writers admit that a
free church in a free state would
benefit both. But politicians who use
religion to further their end, do not
like any change which may be instru
mental in causing their downfall. As
to the program of a clean up, all cit
izens _who love their country are
ditions reveal that injustice is the
rule rather than the exception. There
may be some prejudic'd. Present con
ditions are the fruit of prejudice.
The growth of the Ku Klux Klan
may be stopped. But it can never be
done by criticism. It can be accom
plished merely by a reform so radical
that it will insure justice and a square
deal to every citizen. When unrest
shall disappear, secret orders shall
disappear also. They shall no longer
be necessary. As long as injustice
and prejudice will stay with us, no
human foree shall be able to stop the
growth of the organization which the
popular fancy has entrusted with the
task of saving this country from
professional criminals and political
grafters.
KKK
WHY 60 TO CHURCH ?
One of the best habits any individ
ual can acquire is that of going to
church regularly. Immediately some
guy will rear up on his duclawg and
emit a noise that will reverberate
from one end of town to the other.
“Why don’t you practice what you
“preach?” Well, the answer is, it is
our business to give advice, to preach
to our readers, and we pass on.
Thomas Carlyle, one of the world’s
greatest thinkers and philosophers,
declared that the most important fact
about any man is his religion and
Daniel Webster, American statesman
of massive intellect, said: “The most
eerious thought that can come to
any man is that of his individual res
ponsibility to God.”
But despite the views for these
and innumerable other men of similiar
caliber' who might be quoted, there
are still people who insist that re
ligion and church-going are matters
whiclr interest only the weak-minded.
To such, the opinions of the late
Theodore Roosevelt may be interest
ing. Colonel Roosevelt, who certain
ly was anything but a mollycoddle,
was a churchman and a church-goes.
He gave nine reasons for going to
church as follows:
1. In this actual world a church
less community, a community where
men have abandoned and scoffed at
or ignored their religious needs, is a
community on the rapid down grade.
2. Church work and church at
tendance mean the cultivation of the
habit of feeling some responsibility
for others.
3. There are enough holidays for
most of us. Sundays differ from
other holidays in the fact that there
are 52 of them every year. There
fore Sundays go to church.
4. Yes, I know all the excuses. I
know that one can wroship the crea
tor in a grove of trees, or by a run
ning brook, or in a man’s own house
just as well as in church. But I al
so know as a matter of cold fact the
average man does not thus worship..
5. He may not hear a good sermon
at church. He will hear a good ser
mon by a good man who with his
good wife, is engaged all week in
making hard lives a little easier.
6. He will listen to and take part
in reading some beautiful passages
from the Bible. And if he is not
familiar with the Bible he has suffer
ed a loss.
7. He will take part in singing
some good hymns.
8. He will meet and nod or speak
to good, quiet neighbors. He will
come away feeling a little more chari
tably toward all the world, even to
ward tbo«*e excessively foolish young

“LEGS, DO YO’ DUTY.” WHIS
PERS SAM, AND GOES FAR
AND FAST
Sam White, 21, Negro porter at a
downtown hotel, didn’t attend the Ku
Klux ceremonies Saturday, but before
Sunday’dawned Sam received more
thrills than any candidate at the foot
of the fiery cross.
One o’clock Sunday morning found
Sam lolling as usual a few paces to
the rear of the desk clerk, dreaming
of all the bad luck that had come into
his game with the appearance of
that new bellhop.
“Porter,” the clerk shouted, after
answering the switchboard, and ba n
was soon hurrying skyward with a
pitcher of ice water. After the usual
perfunctory rap at No. 256 Sam en
tered the room. Then the fun began,
Ijiut not for Sam.
