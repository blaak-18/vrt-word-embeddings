What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
COTTONSEED PRODUCTS.
Dear Sir: —I wish you would, in
the next issue of The Jeffersonian,
publish the different kinds of prod
ucts made from cottonseed by the oil
mills, and also give me, as near as
possible, the exact value of a bushel
of cottonseed to the oil mills. Give
us the inside track of the whole busi
ness.
Some of the oil mills in this part
of the country are adulterating their
meal by grinding the hulls and mix
ing with the meal. I suppose about
twenty per cent, of some of it is hulls,
probably more.
Write the whole thing up in an
editorial, and oblige,
Yours with respect,
S. J. WIGGINS.

(Having referred Mr. Wiggins’ in
quiry to an expert, the following re
ply was made.)
Dear Sir: —Replying to your valued
favor, permit me to say the following
figures relative to the value per unit
contained in a ton of cottonseed are
about correct:
Worth
about

Linters 27 lbs. 1.35
Meal 750 lbs. 10.50
Hulls 850 lbs. 2.55
Waste 100 lbs. 00.00
Value of Plant Food in a Ton of Seed.
Nitrogen at .17 per lb $10.62
Phosphoric acid at .05 per lb. 1.27
Potash at .05 per lb 1.17
750 pounds of meal have a
plant food value of $10.31

FACTS ABOUT A PECAN TREE.
The statement that a twelve-year
old pecan tree bore a crop of nuts
which sold for S4O may sound like a
story; it is, however, the plain truth.
Though this be an exception rather
than a general rule it does show what
care and attention will do. I will
try in the following to give the facts
in detail: In the early spring of 1892,
7-5 grafts were made by the party
owning this tree, and only two grew.
In 1893 one of the trees was planted
about 25 feet from the owner’s resi
dence. For two or three years it
made but scant growth, but when
once well established it made up for
lost time. The tree has had the best
of care since planted and has borne
for five years. This its sixth crop
amounted to 100 pounds of nuts; 80
pounds of same were sold to a party
for S4O.
In regard to saying that such a
tree and its crop beats trucking, I do
not want to say that one shall give up
this line of business and plant pecan
trees only; not at all; but plant
pecan trees and raise crops between
them, and by fertilizing and making
the crop, the trees will get the bene
fit, and as they grow and shade the
soil further every year, let them have
the ground to themselves. Do not
disturb the ground by deep plowing
close to the trees or you will injure
them and check their growth. Sup
pose you plant an acre; plant the
trees 50 feet apart; that would take
only 17 trees. The cost of the trees
is insignificant compared with the re
turns in compared period. If they
bring you 40 pounds of nuts when
ten years old, which they surely will
do if you give them care, and sell
those nuts at 25 cents a pound, that
would be $lO a tree or $l7O for 17
trees. This is a low estimate and the
trees will grow up to that, and with
good care will do considerably better,
and all that while you use the ground
between for something else.

WHAT GOOD CULTURE IS.
In the modern rush for the spray
pump for the alleviation of fruit ills,
some people have forgotten the oldest
and most reliable preventive of dis
ease—good culture. By good culture
is meant the care that the plants need
in order to produce the most and the
best fruit. This means first of all,
well-nourished plants. If a tree is
healthy and well nourished, like a
man, it is better able to resist and
throw off disease than if poorly nour
‘ohed. True, good culture alone will
not keep plants free from disease,
but the prevalence of many diseases
is influenced in no small degree by
the conditions under which the
plants are grown. Give the plants
the care and culture they need and
secure in return more and better
fruit. —Farm and Ranch.
PROFIT IN CAMPHOR TREES.
•
The United States Department of
Agriculture will adopt the method of
cultivating the camphor tree in this
southern country which was suggest
ed by the postmaster at Orange,
Texas, James B. Sargent. Several
years ago Mr. Sargent planted a few
camphor trees and found that they
thrived in this climate. He demon
strated the fact that one acre will
produce about 16,00 0, which will net
the producer all the way from $1,200
to $1,600. His plan is to plant the
seed, using about the same method
used in planting cotton, and to mow
the growth with an ordinary mowing
machine, after which it is distilled
and the gum extracted. —Texas Farm

FARMER’S TEN COMMANDMENTS.
Dr. Seaman A. Knaff, who is in
charge of co-operative demonstra
tion work, United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, lays down the
following rules, which he calls the
Ten Commandments of Agriculture:
1. Prepare a deep and thoroughly
pulverized seed bed, well drained;
break in the fall to the depth of 8, 10
or 12 inches, according to the soil,
with implements that will not bring
the subsoil to the surface. The fore
going depths should be reached
gradually.
2. Use seed of the best variety, in
telligently selected and carefully
stored.
3. In cultivating crops, give the
rows, and the plants in the rows, a
space suited to the plant, the soil
and the climate.
4. Use intensive tillage during the
growing period of the crops.
5. Secure a high content of humus
in the soil by the use of legumes,
barnyard manure, farm refuse and
fertilizer.
6. Carry out a systematic crop ro
tation, with a winter cover crop on
Southern farms.
7. Accomplish more work in a day
by using more horsepower and better
implements.
8. Increase the farm stock to the
extent of utilizing all the waste prod
ucts and idle lands of the farm.
9. Produce all the food required
for the men and animals on the farm.
10. Keep an account of each farm
product, in order to know from which
the gain or loss arises.
HOW TO GET EARLY LETTUCE.
Lettuce is a hardy plant, and some
varieties will stand considerable
freezing, says the Southern Farm
Journal. In the Southern States the
seed can be sown in the fall and the
plants grown in frames covered with
cloth. But north of Virginia there is
nothing to be gained by this prac
tice. While the Big Boston, which is
as hardy as any of the varieties, may
be carried over winter, it will make a
slow, tough, leathery growth and
form inferior heads.
The best plan to get lettuce in
early spring is to sow the seed in
hotbed or greenhouse in February
or early March, and transplant to
open groflnd outdoors as soon as a
piece of land can be put in thorough
working order. Some time may be
gained by growing the plants in hot
bed or cold frame, covered by glass
sash and protected by mats or shut
ters when necessary. Select good
early sorts, as May King, Salamander
or Perfection. For home use there is
none to approach the diminutive Tom
Thumb.
The most satisfactory way to bring
a neglected vine into vigorous growth
is to cut the vine off at the ground
and train the shoots that will spring
from the stub in one of the renewal
systems.
Potatoes should be picked up as
fast as dug, as it is hurtful to allow
them to be exposed for several hours.
FARMER OR PLOWMAN?
Farming is a business, and to be
profitable must be done in a business
like way, says Clarence H. Poe in the
Progressive Farmer. The man who
plows is a plowman, not necessarily a
farmer. The farmer is the man who
directs and manages the farm. And
while the plowman and the farmer
may be, and often should be, com
bined in one man, we have had in the
past all too many plowmen, and too
few farmers.
For this reason we urge every one
of our readers to consider carefully
all of his own conditions and sur
roundings this winter so that when
he begins his farm work next season
he may go at it with some definite
plan and with some hope and ex
pectation of accomplishing a certain
definite result. Until we place our
farming on some such basis as this,
and cease to be guided by outworn
traditions or to trust to blind chance
and luck, we can scarcely expect
to make farming either a profitable
or a dignified calling.
APPLES BOUGHT UP AND STORED.
Dispatches tell us that shipments
of apples from Southern Missouri to
Springfield have begun in earnest, ac
cording to Up-to-Date Farming. Most
of the apples are owned by Eastern
buyers and are being placed in cold
storage by the thousands of barrels.
It is expected that between now' and
Christmas prices will jump from $4 to
$6 a barrel.
Only a retelling of the old story.
Those who grow the apples sell them
at picking time when prices are low.
Those who buy them put them away
and hold them until the prices
“jump.” The working farmers make
the produce; the early buyers at the
dumper sales get the profits.
So many examples of this kind have
been brought to the attention of
farmers that it does look like they
would prepare to hold their stuff
themselves, and thus get the profits
they have justly earned. But farm
ers are slow to act outside of the
fields.
Cottonseed has been selling from
$25 to $29 a ton, with the latter
price the favorite. If the mills can
afford to pay these prices, and live,
what profit must they have made
when they paid less than half that
they now pay? Where did the farm
er come in then? —Texas Farm Co
operator.
Shade is very important for all
kinds of stock.
Cured His
Kidney and Bladder
Trouble At Home, At Small Cost. Will
Gladly Tell Any Sutterer How.
Mr. A. S. Hitchcock (Clothing Dealer), 970
Carrier Building, East Hampton, Conn., says
if any sufferer from a Kidney, Bladder or
Uric Acid Ailment will send him their address
he will, without any charge whatsoever, direct
them to the splendid and harmless remedy he
so successfully used at home in his own case.
We suggest it would be well to write him at
once, before letters get so nume ous he be
comes unable to answer them all promptly.
The information he so freely gives has proven
of particular value to hundreds of suffering
people.
