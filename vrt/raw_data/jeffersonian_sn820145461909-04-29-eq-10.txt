Pellagra in the South: A Mystery
The undoubted existence of pel
lagra, the disease which has caused
such ravages in certain provinces of
Itfily, in Georgia and neighboring
States, is attracting the attention and
investigations of medical men, par
ticularly on account of the appear
ance of what seems to be a new or
acute form of it.
Pellagra, ias if is known in Italy,
is not, strictly speaking, a new dis
ease to this country. Seven years
ago, in 1902, Dr. H. F. Harris, secre
tary of the Georgia State board of
health, pointed out a case of it in a
clinic at the Atlanta College of Phy
sicians and Surgeons—the first case
to which attention was called in this
country.
This was the 'well-recognized or
chronic form of the disease, and the
patient, after examination and treat
ment, disappeared from view.
But extraordinary attention and in
terest has recently centered upon the
disease because of the fact that there
have been a number of deaths in the
Atlanta hospitals and in the insane
astlnms of Georgia and other States
from a complaint which has been gen
erally diagnosed as pellagra (from the
Spanish, signifying rough skin), which
is generally recognized and believed
to come from eating unripe or improp
erly cured Indian corn.
These cases, if they are pellagra, as
they have been generally pronounced,
apparently differ from the well-known
form of the disease in only one par
ticular, and that is the rapidity with
which death ensues —in from one to
six weeks following the appearance
of the symptoms.
The patient afflicted with the chron
ic form of pellagra may live anywhere
from two or three to twenty-live years
before death comes as the result of
the infection. And vet this disease
and that more recently noted in Geor
gia, which produces speedy death,
are, apparently, identical in symp
toms.
‘‘l am not wholly prepared to say
that these cases which appear to be
the acute form of the disease are gen
uine pellagra,” said Dr. Harris, who,
in connection with the State board of
health, is making an exhaustive study
of the subject.
THE BIOGRAPHY OF BILL.
(Conitinued from Page Two.)
i Bill tucked her in snugly and then
wedged himself into what space she
didn’t make use of. He was wearing
! his hairiest pants and he fitted the
yacht like a new boot does a bunion.
The boat behaved well, ami as Bill
was a natural born sailor he fairly
dazzled the girl by the style in which
he handled it. In due time, however,
the girl hinted that her folks usually
had supper about six. and Bill woke
up. He commenced Io crawl out of
his coiner. Then he hesitated ami
looked at the girl in an alarmed man
ner. He started again, and ■again
glanced idiotically at the girl. He
then felt around critically with his
hand. The chilly truth was out —his
shaggy trousers had frozen fast to
the yacht. In the words of Old
Sleuth, “He was a prisoner—facing
he knew not what.”
The sad intelligence gradually per-
Jeffersonian
‘‘They certainly Lave every appear
ance of it, and may be acute pellagra.
I have come across something like a
hundred cases of it in the course of
my experience in the last two or three
years, and am now engaged in experi
ments and investigations with a view
of determining the true nature of it.
“The symptoms of pellagra in the
chronic form are, first, a rough red
dishness of the skin from which it
derives its name, and which is some
what similar to sunburn. It appears
on the hands and on the cheeks; then
it may come on the feet and legs and
other tender parts of the body. Then
sores appear upon the inned sides of
the lips and on the tongue. The disease
is accompanied by diarrhoea and in
genuine pellagra there are certain well
known changes which occur in the
spinal cord. The only effective treat
ment is arsenic in proper doses, and
the patient usually improves in the
fall of the year and is worse in the
spring.
“In the acute form which we are
investigating, the symptoms are prac
tically identical. It has not been
definitely determined, however,
whether the same changes occur in the
spinal cord and that is a.matter we
are now working on. I have secured
several cords from patients who died
from the disease at insane asylums
and am investigating these. Then,
too, the acute form does not yield to
the arsenic treatement. There is no
known effective treatment for it, and
death generally ensues within a few
weeks at most.
“On the other hand, I have seen
comparatively few cases of chronic
pellagra. One patient who has been
under the arsenic treatment, appears
to have recovered, but whether re
covery is complete or not, time must
develop. The chronic form, however,
appears to he less prevalent here than
the acute.”
Pellagra is still one of the medi
cal mysteries. There are conditions
which occur in certain cereals when
they are harvested in an unripe condi
tion, or are improperly cured, which
cause different diseases. For example,
ergotism comes from eating rye from
which all of the fungus or ergot has
colated to the girl and seemed to
amuse her greatly. Bill advised her
to run on home and send down the
fire company or the police, but she
flatly refused. She said lie had
brought her there ami he had to take
her home.
Bill relapsed into painful thought,
and could feel himself growing closer
and lighter to the planks every mo
ment. At last, with a rosy blush,
v hicii was half-concealed by the pale
light of the setting sun, he extracted
his jackknife and set to work. If
memory serves me right, the girl re
sponded gamely to the call of neces
sity, and assisted at critical stages
of the operation. At length Bill
stood—or, rather, sat—free. From
then on history is inaccurate or frag
mentary, and the present writer re
luctantly chronicles his entire ignor
ance of the facts. Bill’s wife—who
was the girl in the case—has neyer
mentioned it—Judge,
