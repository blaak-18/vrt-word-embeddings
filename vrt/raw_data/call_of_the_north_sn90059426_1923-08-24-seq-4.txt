MARRIAGE LAWS RLAMED BY
JUDGE IN DIVORCE STUDY
-k-k
•‘Real Hope of World in Sensible Presentation
of Subject.**
Winona Lake, Ind.—Divorcee are
granted in America at the rate of
one every four minutes throughout
the year, and are more numerous here
annually in proportion to total pop
ulation than in any other country
which records marriage statistics.
The annual total of decrees for the
forty-eight states is in the neighbor
hood of 160,000 and is increasing
three times as fast as the population.
Such are the conclusions of Judge W.
H. Thomas of Santa Anna, Calif., for
mer associate justice of the Califor
nia district court of appeals, drawn
from a world survey of marriage and
divorce figures in preparation for an
American campaign for a national
code governing marital relations.
Judge Thomas’ survey included fif
ty-four countries, and the summary
of his study, made public here,
reaches back into the domestic rela
tions of ancient Rome, Greece and
Babylon. In his conclusions is the
suggestion that our national life is
seriously threatened by the present
status of our family relationships.
Much of our trouble, he believes, is
chargeable to the chaotic state of
our marriage laws, and his recom
mendation is a uniform law, applica
ble to all American territory, based
on wisdom and experience.
“In contrast with our records, one
divorce for every nine marriages.”
Judge Thomas said, “those of France
and Germany, our closest competitors,
dwindle into insignificance. We have
only one rival, Japan. Until recently
that nation has been grinding out di
orces faster than our own. Now,
however, the United States census
bureau discloses a rapidly mounting
table of divorce which far outstrips
the ratio of increase in population.
Our rate of increase in divorces be
tween 1870 and 1917 was for the en
tire country exactly 400 per cent.”
In 1870, he said, we had twenty-eight
divorces for every 100,000 of popula
tion; in 1916 the figure was 112 for
each 100,000.
In Canada in the whole year of
1913 there were fifty-nine divorces.
Seventeen states in the Union fix
no marriageable age, he pointed out
in commenting on our present varied
law. In nine of these states—Florida-
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mis
souri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, and Vermont, the common
law ages of 12 for girls, and ?4 for
boys have been formally recognized
by the courts. In 19 states there is
no law restraining feeble-minded per
sons from marrying, and only three
states forbid miseugenic unions, or
marriages between people of different
races.
There are now in the United States
mere than 12,000 married girls under
15 years of age. Approximately 100,-
000 girls 17 years or young are mar
ried.
“No logical and sound-thinking per
son any longer denies that, in certain
circumstances, men and women who
can not live harmoniously together
should be allowed to reconstruct their
happiness.” Judge Thomas declared.
“No one now argues against the ne
cessity for marriage laws which will
make it impossible for the immature
and unfit to marry and reproduce.
“Every one is satisfied that thes4
laws must be uniform. Hence the
time for action has come. And be
cause men have dilly-dallied about it,
and because, too, the integrity of the
family is woman's quest, upon the

women of the country must be laid
the business of bringing about re
form.
“But legislation will not usher in
an era of wisely planned marriages.
The real hope of the world lies in
putting as much painstaking and pro
gressive thought into the great busi
ness of mating as we do into the
other big businesses of our day, and
in bringing to bear .upon marriage
the advanced ideas of science, reli
gion and law, so that we shall be
able to offer to young men and women
a sensible presentation of the sub
ject that will convince them of the
necessity of permanent family rela
tions and assure them of the happi
ness to be found in a wholesome,
family life.
“Unification of marriage and di
vorce laws is only a partial solution
of the problem. There must be early
training for marriage and parent
hood, and this cannot be provided for
by law.”

TELLS SOUTH SIPERS HE WILL
NOT “MAKE FOOL OF HIM

—K-K-K
Senator Magnus Johnson assured
South Side residents at their picnic
at Riverside park Wednesday night
that when he gets up on the floor
of the Senate he’s going to talk
“common sense.”
“Don’t think that in a few months
in that high office I’m going to hurt
the business people,” he said.
“Don’t believe I’m going to make
a fool of myself, because I’m not go
ing to do it. You need not think
f hat because I’m not a lawyer or a
banker that I can’t think right. If
I do go up on the floor to talk I’m
going to talk common sense.”
The speaker urged people in the
city and the farmers to “co-operate
together.” He said that during his
eieht years in the legislature he
helped Minneapolis by voting for leg
islation that was best for the city.
“I say that when I take my place
with Henry Lodge and the others he
will understand me all right.”
The senator said that he had been
out through the state moulding pub
lic opinion.
“Woe unto me,” he said, “if I
mould any public opinion that is not
moulded on solid foundation.”
“I get my information from every
nook and comer, but while I havn’t
pot the silver tongue of the big ora
tors, it doesn’t make any difference.
I’m going to stand for measures that
are just and honest.”

Germany is said to be apprehen

one large section the Communists
are expected to take up arms and be
assisted by the Russian ► Bolshevists.
In another wide district the mon

will give battle for a return to the
Hohenzollerns or other royal leader
ship. Maybe Germany could get
a-going if she had two revolutions as
a starter. —Los Angeles Times.

IMPRESSED FOREVER.
There are occasional doubts in the
minds of the elders of the Moore
family as to the quickness of Tom
my's wits, but there has never been
any doubt that a lesson learned by
him, however, slowly, is forever after
remembered.
“Won’t you shake hands with me,
Tommy?” asked one of his sister’s
admirers, but Tommy hung back.
“I don’t care to,” he said, with
terrib’e distinctness.
“Don’t you like me?” asked the un
wise visitor.
“No, I don't!” replied Tommy, and
then there was a shocked chorus
from the family.
“Tommy,” said his aunt, reproach
fully, as she withdrew him from the
public gaze, “why did you say such a
rude thing to Mr. Jones?”
“Because, auntie,” said her wrig
gling charge, “I got licked last week
for not telling the truth, and I
shan’t never take any risks again!”

AFTER DUE ALLOWANCES.
A son arrived in the family of a

and the young father rushed out of

There were no portable scales in the
neighborhood.
“Any rags, any bottles?” sang a
voice in the street.
“Here, you!” called the proud fa
ther. “Come here, I want you to
weigh something for me.”
The junkman followed the proud
oarent. Baby was tied up in a towel
<md hooked to the scales. The indi
cator showed exactly seven pounds.
“Seven pounds!” cried the nurse.
“Seven pounds!” echoed the disap
pointed father.
“Don’t let that worry you,” re
marked the junkman. “Them is the
scales I buy by. I guess the child
weighs 10 pounds, mebbe a little over
that.”—Kansas City Star.

SETS AWFUL JOLT
Corn certainly is a flae prospect
in Martin county.
The other day one of those wise
auto tourists from Ohio stopped at
a farm house in Jay township at
some time after dark and wanted to
know what road he ought to take
to get out of the timber. For at
least twenty miles, he declared, most
of the roadway was so lined with
heavy timber that he was afraid he
might at any minute suffer the ca
lamity of having his family attacked
by wolves, wildcats and other fero
cious animals.
He was quite concerned over their
welfare, he went on, and he would
appreciate any advice the farmer
would give him that might lead him
safely out of the wilderness.
“Why," he went on, “I was under
the impression that Southern Min
nesota had only a scattering of tim
ber, and here for nearly half an hour
we’ve been traveling through the
densest forests I’ve ever seen out
side of Africa.”
“Look here,” he added, confiden
tially, “you give us a bunk tonight
or show us the way out of this
wooded wildness and I’ll make it 2P
ron men and you may keep the
change.
“It isn’t that I’m afraid or any
thing like that,” he continued as the
farmer kept his quid of chewing to
bacco in rapid transit from one
-heek to the other, “but you can’t
blame a guy for having due con
cern for his wife and children, can
you?”
A light suddenly broke in on the
nuzzled brain of the farmer and it
so illuminated his risibilities that he
aughed until his side ached and the
tourist thought he had run off his
trolley.
“How come?” was all the latter
could find to lay his tongue to.
“Why, you poor fish,” replied the
’andlord as he doubled up again, “you
are the best thing that has hap
nened since Barnum invented clowns.
You aren’t within four hundred miles
■*f wildcats,” he continued, “and as
for wolves, there isn’t a wolf in, Mar
gin county but what if he saw you
mming he would turn tail and never
top running. Timber! Say, sonny,
mu haven’t begun to see timber.
Those are cornfields you’ve been
nassing along the road. Now—”
