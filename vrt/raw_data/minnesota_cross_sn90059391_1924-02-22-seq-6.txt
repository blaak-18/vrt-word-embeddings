Some measure of the value of the
Ku Klux idea to members of the
Klan can be found in tbe price they
pay to join. The amount is not
large—slo for initiation and $6 for
regalia—yot as the price of getting
behind an idea that is considerable.
One can join a good many movements
for less, and among the people who
make up the bulk of the Klan
strength even sls is not treated with
disrepect. Any one who has ever
tried to enlist people, at a price, in
any general movement will testify
that it is no mean achievement to
induce four million men to pay any
thing at all.
To this first cost must be added the
fact that most members have joined
the Klan in the face of strong pub
lic disapproval and often of actual
persecution. Add, too, the attitude
of members toward the Klan, the
serious view they take of its doc
trine, their often almost fanatical
devotion, and it begins to be plain
that the Klan means something
rather important to them. It may
not be what the Klan stand for offi
cially. it may be something warped
or even vicious, but the Klan seems
to them to offer something they
want badly, something they are will
ing to pay for both in cash and in
service.
When there are four million people
held in this way by an idea, there
can be no doubt that the idea has
power. Imperial Wisard Evans de
clares that it is the most potent
idea in America, and there is some
truth in thia But he means the
Klan idea as he sees it, and it must
be remembered that the real driving
force is not his idea, but the thought
in the minds of the Klansmen them
selves, often something very differ

animates and unites these four mil
lions is to set to one side the excres
cences on the movement. They are
both noisy and numerous, and it is
very easy to mistake them for the
real embodiment of the Klan.
As soon as any organization begins
to gain power, certain kinds of men
join it for personal profit. There will
be promoters and organizers, second
rate politicians, business men looking
for trade, sharks seeking prey, crim
inals hoping for protection, and
chronic failures who will trv any
thing. The more powerful the or
ganization, the more numerous and
active will be these parasites, hypo
crites, and grafters. The Klan has
its full share of them, and they are
often prominent, since high places
are the beet for the grinding of pri
vate axes. But, after all, they are
parasites, and do not represent the
idea and spirit that gave the Klan
Its great growth. They are impor
tant in many ways, for they have in
fluence, but one cannot measure the
real Klan by them.
There are such differences between
the Klan as it appears in Georgia and
Texas, in Ohio and New York, that
there is room for doubt whether it
actually is moved by a single spirit.
Yet I believe that it is; that there
is a unifying idea, a certain least
commoia denominator of thought,
which may be found and defined.
There is, of coarse .the “native, white
Protestant supremacy” of the Klan
creed, but that appears to be a for
mula of action and a theory of social
organization rather than an end or
purpose in itself, and it is not by
any means always involved in Klan
activities. The true spirit seerr.s to
be something deeper, and at bottom
far healthier, although it sometimes
shows in dangerous and even abom
inable forms.
This fundamental and unifying
idea is nothing more abnormal than
a passion for reform as Dr. Evans
has said. Yet it is abnormal, too,
for with the Klan this very common
trait has an intensity, a directness,
and a concept of personal duty to
do something, such as are seldom
found. And it produces very unus
ual manifestations. This is partly
because the Klan reaches some
classes seldom stirred by such senti
ments and therefore unfamiliar with
the accepted procedure; people of
simple, direct, and intense emotions
who act accordingly. Partly, too, it
is due to the violent prejudices and
instincts the Klan doctrine arouses.
But whether the immediate aim be
the regulation of a neighbor’s con
duct or the ousting of parochial
schools or of corrupt officials, re
form of some sort has beeen the
moving spirit of the Klan wherever
I have seen it.
This is not a blanket approval
far from it. There can be little de
bate that the reform spirit on the
whole is useful, but only when kept
within limits. The line is not well
defined; sincere people who disap
prove equally of drink, tobacco,
gambling and the like are to be
found on both sides of the questions
of how far one’s own virtue should
regulate other people’s vices; but
there is always a saving popular re
sistance which prevents most re
forms from going too far. The Klan
aims to go very far indeed; even of
ficially it attacks questions and em
ploys methods to which we are not
hardened, in its programme it ap
plies race and religious standards
which we are in the habit of ignor
ing, and its individual members have
aims and use methods considerably
farther from normal than the lead
ers wish.
Moreover, reform at its best has
some unlovely aspects. It always
implies a “holier than thou” atti
tude, it always makes trouble and
disturbs the even tenor of life, it is
often so beneficial to the reformers
that their motives may easily be
questioned, and it sometimes shows
a narrow, meddling, officious, un
just, and even cruel spirit. Often,
too, the pleasure of reforming others
appeals more strongly than the good
to be done. All these things appear
strongly in some members of the
Klan; indeed, it often seems that
the Klan is demonstrating just how
bad reform may be. It is no won
der the opposition is violent. But,
however distorted, the Klan idea is
at bottom nothing more or less than
a new and startling outbreak of our
good old American habit of rear
ranging the world. There is much
expert testimony that we do this of
tener and worse than any other peo
ple on earth.
When all allowances are made for
other motives —love of excitement,
self-interest and brutality—this re
form idea is still to be seen even in
the worst of the Klan actions, the
night-riding and maltreating of
neighbors. This particular phase is
worth some atudy, since if one can
understand this it will be easier to
understand also some of the less vic
ious but still dangerous practices of
Klansmen.
There is no need to list the evils
of night-riding, hut it is always
worth while to find why compara
tively decent people take to doing
utterly wrong things. I put this
question to the Governor of a State
PRINCIPLES
STANLEY FROST
which has been peculiarly cursed
with this evil—a man who has done
much to stop violence and has been
especially active against Klan mobs.
The conditions he describes are still
to be found in many placee, both in
the South and elsewhere.
“You understand that I don’t de
fend mob action in any case or form,”
the Governor began. "Yet there is
something to be said for it —some-
times. There have been casee where
I had to admit some sympathy. But
I’m afraid this can hardly be under
stood by you people who live in com
munities so well protected that po
lice corruption means at worst boot
legging and poker games, and a
‘crime wave’ means that there is
about one chance in fifty thousand
that you will suffer from something
worse thaa sneak-thievery.
-Try to imagine, if you can, what
it would mean to live where it is
practically impossible to enforce any
law, where intimidation and abuse
are customary, theft common, arson
not unusual, and murder occasional —
all unpunishable. ’Riere are such
places. Sparse settlement, family
feuds, powerful criminal elements,
make it almost impossible to get
sure law enforcement in these
plague-spots. And you can't reform
them by the ballot, for the toughs
control the elections.
“If any man takes the lead in try
ing to clean up, he will suffer. If
he is not killed, his bams will be
burned, his crops ruined, his stock
killed or stolen, his women folk in
sulted. So there has always been a
tendency in this State—and some
other than ofrm vigilance commit
tees to handle such situations. You
can call it cowardice if you want to.
but when a body of unknown men
apply preesure to the tough element,
they can get results and still be safe
from reprisals. Scores of places have
been cleaned up in just that way.
And when people are suffering like
that you can’t expect them to wor
ry about the danger that the same
methods will be unjustly used some
other time.
‘That was the condition which
gave the Klan its first start in this
State. The best people didn’t join,
of course, and a lot of the uneducat
ed, poor white trash did. Lately the
Klan has changed its method and
some of the better class are joining.
But they’ll lose out if they can’t
keep on cleaning up.”
llus testimony would be enough,
even if standing alone. But the con
dition seems to have been general in
all the States where much night-rid
ing occurred. In my articles on Ok
lahoma I told how it was the desire
to suppress "high-jacking” and boot
legging and dope-peddling that gave
the Klan its start there. Even in the
Mer Rouge horrors—whatever the
facts there may be—the Klan action
was taken to stop alleged criminal
traffic. The motive is always re
form; the purpose almost always a
decent one.
The Governor, however, did not get
at the whole reason for the appeal
which night-riding makes to this
particular element. It has certain
attractions besides reform for simple
and direct minds. When Dr. Evans
started his campaign which has prac
tically stopped violence as a Klan
method, a friend in the South wrote
me about it.
“I shall be surprised if the South
ern faction agrees with Evans in the
matter of violence ’ he said. “Those
methods are the g t eat attraction,
the basis of confidence ,a manner of
executing justice that renders the
greatest personal satisfaction.”
That “personal satisfaction”—in
executing justice, be it noted! —was
undoubtedly one of the lures of the
white masks until a few months ago.
And my friend’s estimate was cor
rect, too, for the Evans campaign
was followed by a falling off of Klan
strength in the night-riding States.
There are signs now that a new and
better element is joining, but there
is no doubt that the method used,
as well as the reforms to be made,
hetped give the Klan its hold.
There is another motive, almost
as indefensible as the impulse to
mob violence, but easier to sympa
thize with and far more widespread,
which has brought many members in->
to the Klan and is still bringing
them. This is the desire to correct
evils—often personal ones—which
are out-of reach of the law, through
mass action of various kinds. Most
of us bear these ills, especially those
of other people, with such grins,
shrugs, or curses as our natures call
for, but great numbers see in the
Klan machinery for reform along
just these lines.
“I wish I was as simple-minded as
some folks,” one circuit judge con
fided. “Then I’d join the Klan. One
of the things that make a judge’s
life hard is the wrong for which
there is no legal remedy; the unfair
but not criminal method of slick
crooks ,the betrayals of women where
more harm than good is done if the
law is called in, the oppression of
money-lenders, the laziness of men
who let their children starve—all so
common we take them for granted,
and nice folks think they’re melo
dramatic, but all devilish, just the
same. I can’t do anything about
them.
“I can’t stand, either, for action
against them that isn’t based on trial
and evidence. But the Klan doesn’t
worry about that. They are neigh
bors and know what’s happened, and
they let it go at that. They want
action, and they think that’s what
they’re there for and go at it bald
headed. Usually they’re right, so
far as substantial justice is concern
ed. I don't blame them—much.”
Many Klansmen avow this motive
freely enough.
“I joined just to see that they got
after ,” one friend told me, nam
ing a notorious cheat.

THE FIERY CROSS
America Turns
To Its Schools
(An Editorial from The Kansas
City Star)
There has been more than a single
cause for the unprecedented interest
in education in the United States
since the close of the war. An impor
tant factor has been the lesson dem
onstrated in the military forces;
that is, that trained men rise more
rapidly to places of leadership than
the untrained. Thousands of men
who entered the service came back
to complete or begin their education
with that lesson in mind. Further,
the revelations of a high percentage
of illiteracy among drafted men have
roused the entire nation to an urgent
need of education for all.
But whatever the cause or causes
of the development, the advance of
education, as indicated in the growth
of high schools, larger funds for
schools and increased enrollment in
all kinds of educational institutions,
has been fairly startling. Dr. James
R. Angell, president of Yale Univer
sity, declared last week “we are in
the midst of the most unparalleled
educational development tne world
has ever seen.” President Angell
showed that the number of high
schools has increased more than 700
per cent in the last thirty years, and
that now there are more than two
million high school students, com
pared with seven hundred thousand
thirty years ago. He added:
There are from six hundred
thousand to seven hundred thou
sand students in the colleges, and
the number is rapidly increasing.
In a state like lowa the number
of students is increasing in leaps
and bounds, while the population
has not increased at any such
rate. The increase may go on
until every boy and girl in that
state will receive the education
that the institutions can give.
That is a condition we hope will
be arrived at everywhere.
Whether college training is possi
ble for all within any reasonable pe
riod, or even desirable, might be open
to considerable debate. Means of
limiting enrollments are now regard
ed as serious problems by many col
lege heads. But that a fair degree of
education ought to bepossible for all
is beyond question. Triat possibility
does not yet exist. Some of the in
equalities of our educational system
President Angell emphasizes. Out
standing among these are the inad
equate schools and poorly trained
teachers in many of the rural dis
tricts. About half the rural teach
ers “never completed the grades
themselves. It is a case of the blind
leading the blind.”
So America’s advance in education
has not been general. Illiteracy still
is a problem, but fortunately a prob
lem to which serious attention is now
being given. For the rural schools
the chief hope seems to lie in con
solidation. That method has been
most fruitful in bringing better build
ings and better trained teachers. In
another decade there ought to be no
1-room schoolhouses, no teachers
without special training, and no il
literates. Then America’s advance in
education will have been, indeed, a
national benefit.
Klan Grows Following:
Talk in Newton Hall
NEUTON. IA„ Feb. 19.—Eight hun
dred people recently attended a lec
ture in Graber’s Hall, at which the
principles and aims of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan were explained.
As a result ,the organization is
growing by leaps and bounds, not
only in Newton, but throughout Jas
per county.
A special effort was made by the
Newton Daily News to publish a gar
bled report of the gathering and
what was said by the speaker.
LEAVENWORTH, KANS.—The Ku
Klux Klan of Leavenworth for some
time have been forced to hold out
door meetings, owing to the lack of
a suitable meeting place. Ten acres
of ground at the summit of Pilot
Knob hill have been purchased and
the Klansmen are building a klav
ern large enough to accommodate the
rapidly increasing membership. Con
struction work is being done entirely
by the members of the Klan.
COFFEYVILLE, KANS.—KIan sym
pathizers are said to be forming plans
to launch a new morning daily news
paper here. The Morning News is
strongly anti-Klan, and local mem
bers of the order, tired of its abuse,
are seeking to establish a paper that
will give them fair treatment.
APPLETON, WlS.—Under the su
pervision of a former Indiana organ
izer the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
of Appleton is growing rapidly. A
class of 175 candidates was natural
ized last week. Many of the leading
citizens of Appleton, Kaukauna, Nee
nah and Manasha are members.
SUMMERVILLE, PA.—Acting upon
information furnished by the Klan of
Summerville, the sheriff and two
state police of Jefferson county raid
ed a gambling and bootlegging house
January 19. The sheriff deputized 40
Klansmen for the work. Seven men
were arrested.
Fiery Cross Burns From
Klavern Every Night
ATHENS, GA., Feb. 21.—Athens
Klansmen believe in “letting their
light so shine,” it is evidenced by
the erection of a large forty-foot
fiery cross on the roof of their
Klavern. This cross is to burn
fom sun down to sun up, 365 days
a year. Although one or the young
er Klans of the state, it has its
own Klavern, which would do cred
it to cities larger than Athens.
Authentic\Story of ‘Bloody
Williamson’ Raids Related
(By INVESTIGATOR)
HERRIN, ILL., Feb. 20—If
“Bloody Williamson" were an ac
tuality, the crimson stain would
come from the broken hearts of
its best citizens; men and women
whose home town has been rav
ished by rotten politicians, boot
leggers, gamblers,* resort keep
ers and their supporters and pa
trons; men and women who have
seen their “Main Street” corrupt
ed into an avenue of pitfalls for
sons and daughters; men and
women whose lives and works as
good citizens were sacrificed by
a small group of vicious, lawless
men, incited by the basest pas
sions and mad with greed for
money and political power.
As a matter of fact, “Bloody Will
iamson” county exists today only on
the front pages of the yellow press,
except for that dark-stained side
walk in front of the Home Club,
where Constable Caesar Cagle, Klans
man, died a martyr last week. He
was shot down by the gang that op
poses the re-establishment of law and
order in the coal fields.
With S. Glenn Young, noted law en
forcement officer, acting as chief of
police by appointment of John Ford,
chief; with Mayor C. E. Anderson,
Sheriff George Galligan, Chief Dep
uty John Layman, Ora Davis, head
of the “Flaming Circle,” anti-Klan or
ganization, and a score of their as
sistants .deputies and henchmen un
der arrest on charges of murder in
connection with the death of Con
stable Cagle; with men of unques
tioned integrity, practically all of
whom are said to be Klansmen,
sworn in as policemen to replace the
Anderson-Galligan piratical crew,
Herrin ia experiencing the restore
tion of law and order out of chaos,
and enjoying the life of a well-regu
lated American town for the first
time in many a long day.
The raids led by Mr. Yonng, and
conducted by the best citizens of
the county, sworn in as officers for
this special duty, have closed up the
saloons on the principal thorough
fares, the joints directly across the
street from the city hall, and the
half a hundred “bootlegging dens”
throughout the county. Dozens of
whisky peddlers, gamblers, gun men,
and “imported gangsters” are under
arrest so this little city is now as
quiet and orderly as Chicago’s high
brow suburb, Evanston.
Were it not for the nine companies
of Illinois National Guardsmen called
here for some reason by Sheriff Galli
gan before there was a hint of
trouble, and some hours before Con
stable Cagle was decoyed to death
by the murder gang, of which the
sheriff, himself, is charged with be
ing a member, Herrin with its auto
cratic, but beneficent acting chief of
police and his citizen aides, would be
going about its business in its usual
way, with the exception, of course,
that all the “joints" are closed and
the gangsters that have given the
community a bad reputation these
many years are in jail “Somewhere in
Illinois.”
klansmen and other good citizens
do not resent the presence of the
soldiers. They just feel that their
presence is unnecessary; that the
state is put to a great expense and
the officers and men to a needless in
convenience by the mobilization here.
Interviews with more than twenty
of the most highly connected business
and professional men did not disclose
a single one who thought that the
soldiers should have been sent here.
News stories asserting that thou
sands of miners in this district are
striking in order to fight the Klan
and the good citizens who stand with
that organisation are untrue. I am
authorized to say that hundreds of
miners, the men who are known to
be steady, honest, hard-working, are
members of the Knights of the Ku
klux Klan. The United Mine Work
ers of America, radical labor organi
zation, to which all union miners
must belong, attempts, by constitu
tional provision, to bar its members
from affiliation with the Klan, but
hundreds of Williamson county coa!
miners are 100 per cent American
first, and pawns of U. M. W. officials
last, if at all.
It is true that some miners are bit
terly opposed to the Klan. The Ital
ian colony and other foreign groups
in this district are large, and these
groups are notoriously opposed to
Americanized standards of life, citi
zenship, and law enforcement. It is
from this class that Sheriff Galligan.
Ora Davis, and other leaders of the
"Corruption Ring” recruited their
confederates and selected their
“hootch” retailers. Some of these
men have “laid off” from work in a
futile effort to keep in touch with
their imprisoned chiefs. They are
the so-called strikers.
It is the concensus of opinion ex
pressed to me by a score of repre
sentative men, including non-Klans
men as well as members of that pa
triotic organization, that eighty-five
per cent of the total population of
Williamson county is in entire sym
pathy and accord with Mr. Young’s
clean-up program and will support a
movement to make that stalwart of
ficer sheriff of the county as soon
Calligan is convicted of murder or
removed from office.
With the best citizens organized
for the first time in the cause of
civic righteousness and law enforce
ment, determined to end the lawless
ness that has existed here un< er
many mayoral regimes, Herrin and
Williamson county face the future
with the conviction that even in th e
coal fields Americanism shall tri
umph.
Discover Murder Plot
The conditions that forced Will
iamson county’s best citizens to t . n _
force the laws laughed at by the u-,.
perados in public office spawned
many sinister plots and desperate
deeds, but even the infamous miners’
massacre of eighteen months ago was
not so cold-blooded in its awfulness
as was the conspiracy that resulted
in the slaying of Constable Cagle,
the kidnapping of Chief of Police
John Ford, his assistant Harold
Crane, and the attempted assassina
tion of Law Enforcer Young, Sam
Sterns, Exalted Cyclops of the Ma
rion Klan, Abe Hicks, Police Magis
trate John Whiteside, Herrin business
man and clean-up leader. The failure
of the conspirators to murder all of
these “marked men” ia attributed by
Young to “a loss of nerve at the last
minute” on the part of the gang
leaders who weakened when “Cagle
pitched forward on his face when
shot in the back.”
Constable Cagle was killed Friday
evening, February Bth. With his
wife he was attending a function,
given in her honor, at the Masonic
hall His small son was down town,
where he had been observed by the
enemy. When the youngster started
home he was stopped and directed to
go to the Masonic hall and inform
his father that “There Is trouble
down at the ‘Rome’ club over the
Jefferson saloon. Come at once.”
The innocent child delivered the mes
sage to his father. Constable Cagle,
good officer that he was, responded
to the call. As he approached the
entrance to the saloon he was met
by a gang of men, one of whom
struck him in the face. As he fell
he was shot twice by other members
of the gang, and died on the side
walk like a dog.
While this tragedy was being en
acted, a similar message was sent to
Chief of Police Ford. He, with As
sistant Chief Crane, responded, and
upon entering the “Rome” club, the
meeting place of the notorious “Flam
ing Circle” gang, the gangsters
opened fire upon them, disarmed and
captured them. During the shoot
ing, John Layman, chief deputy sher
iff and one of the inmates of the
resort, was wounded.
Law Enforcer Young, with a num
ber of his aides, returning to Herrin
from Marion, the county seat, to ar
rest the murderers and quell the ex
citement, was ambushed from the
roadside. A volley of rifle shots was
poured into the automobile occupied
by his party. That the party escaped
is due to the fact that they rode in
a new automobile which had just
been presented to Young by the citi
zens of Williamson county as a to
ken of their admiration, and not in
his old car, which was known to law
violators in Southern Illinois as the
“old gun boat.” The car was riddled
with bullets, but its driver was un
injured.
The attempt to “get” Young was
given added zest last week when
members of the “Flaming Circle”
imported a half dozen members of
the “Eagan’s Rats” gang from St.
Louis, armed them and made up a
“jack pot” of $5,000 cash, to be giv
en to the man who “bumps him off.”
Upon the arrival of Young and his
party in Herrin, hurried, but com
prehensive investigation revealed the
identity of many of the gangsters in
the groups that killed Constable Ca
ttle and captured the chief of police
and his assistant.
Warrants charging murder were
sworn out against the following:
“MAJ” ANDERSON erstwhile
mayor of Herrin, against whom evi-
I dence is being secured connecting
! him directly with the lawlessness that
i has made this city a by-word through
out the country;
GEORGE GALLIGAN—Sheriff of
Marion county, reputed leader of
lawlessness in the county, and against
whom Law Enforcer Young will seek
indictments from the federal grand
jury for accepting bribes in connec
tion with liquor cases;
JOHN LAiMAN —Chief deputy,and
“brains” of the “Flaming Circle”
gang .associate of bootleggers and re-
HUGlTWlLLlS—Committeeman of
the United Mine Workers of Ameri
ca, “bad man;”
ALVIN THOMAS—Deputy sheriff,
reputed bootlegger, associate of gam
blers;
ELL TROUTT—Mine guard, reput
ed bootlegger, some time mine
guard, and admitted “hard guy;”
ORA THOMAS—Head of the in
famous “Flaming Circle,” deputy
sheriff, owner of saloon and gambling
hall, under SIO,OOO bond for liquor
celling, sponsor of the “Eagan’s
Hats;’*
HEZZIE BURNS —Deputy sheriff,
under charges of bribery, associate
of Berger, proprietor of the “Half
way House, liquor and vice dive;
WILLIAM RUFF —Miner, reputed
member of the “Flaming Circle;”
CARL RUFF —brother of the above,
miner, and proud of his family name;
JOHNNY MURRAY—Part owner of
the notorious Carterville pike road
house and bootlegging joint;
HARRY MURRAY—brother and
business partner of the above.
Gangsters Resist Arrest
The true story of the arrest of
these men has never yet been told.
Press accounts differ in all essential
details, and the facts in connection
with the battle waged by the des
perado fortified in the city hospital
against officers armed with warrants
for their arrest is disclosed for the
first time.
Atcer the murder of Constable
and the capture of Chief of Po
lice and his assistants, the “Flaming
Circle” gangsters divided. One group
under the leadership of Sheriff Galli
gan left the city in automobiles with
their prisoners, presumably to mur
der them upon some lonely highway.
The other group, under the leauer
ship of the wounded Chief Deputy
Layman, repaired to the city hospi
tal three blocks distant from tne
scene of the murder.
Here they closed the doors and win
dows, examined their arms and pre
pared to resist the inevitable effort
to place them under arrest.
Law Enforcer Young with his aides,
Friday, February 22, 1921
repaired to the hospital upon learn
ing that the Layman gang was forti
fied there. Approaching the entranc*
to the two-storv brick building, the
officers knocked upon the closed and l
locked doors, demanding admittance'
in the name of the law. The answer
to the demand was a volley of rifle*
and revolver shots, fired through the'
closed doors into the group of citi
zen-officers. Miraculously, no one*
was killed. Unable to froce an en
trance, and not wishing to endanger
the lives of patients and attendant*
within the hospital. Young and hie
aides withdrew. As they crossed the
ft reet, the desperadoes within the
hospital opened fire upon a partjr
from second story winaows. Under -
Young’s orders, members of his partjr
shot out the street lights that madw
them all vivid targets for the snip
ers. They also fired at the men who
exposed themselves at the windowSr
but could not conduct a general at
tack because of the danger to hospi
tal patients.
With Layman and his gang in the
custody of the military, Sheriff Gal
ligan under arrest, and the moral*
of the lawless element broken, the
captors of the chief of police an<f
his assistant dared not carry out
their plan to murder the officers,
but holding them in the Marion jail
incommunicado throughout Saturday*
and until Sunday noon, released them*
with a warning.
In vest (ration Continues
With Sheriff Galligan and his dep
uties under arrest, the county coro
ner, W. H. McCowan, automatically
succeeds to the position of ranking
officer of the law in Williamsoi*
county. He is not looked upon as *
strong supporter of the good citi
zens’ clean-up campaign, nor is he
expected to be of material assist
ance in securing evidence against
those men under arrest charged witls
murder, nor in apprehending other*
who are believed to have been in
volved.
In view of these facts Acting Chief
of Police Young is burdened with the
responsibility of bringing the guilty
to justice. His office in the city
hall is the center of activities anil
with his citizen-aides he is system
atically following up every clue that
will be of value in the proseution of
the gangsters who have terrorized
this county so long.
Mr. Young told me that scores of
men who have been allied in th*
crimes that have blackened thi*
community are voluntarily givinff*
him information now that the im
munity of their leaders has crumbled.
These men implicate others, who ar*
immediately sent for and questioned.
All testimony is being taken dowis
by stenographers, and it will make
up a record that is sure to convict
many men who have held position*
of public trust in this city and coun
ty.
Leaders See Hope
It is felt here that if the national
guard is withdrawn; the men under
arrest and their confederates who
have not yet been apprehended,
brought to honest trial; and perma
nent injunctions secured against the
fifty-two places in Herrin and vicin
ity that were selling liquor in opei»
defiance of the law; the better ele
ment can maintain control of the
county and city governments and
conduct them as inherently Americars
communities should be conducted.
Among the men who believe this
are:
George H. Harrison, president of
the First National Bank.
Henry LeMaster, secretary of th®
Herrin Building & Loan Assn.
H. D. Muille, leading merchant.
Carl Neilson, manager wholesale
grocery.
Dr. L. E. Kane, physician.
Police Magistrate Hicks.
H. A. Bryson, mine official.
H. O. Fowler, leading grocer.
W. H. Smith, garage owner and
auto dealer.
Dr. S. Channess, physician.
Rev. I. E. Lee, pastor First Baptist
church.
Rev. P. R. Glotfelty, pastor First
M. E. church.
Charles Cargal, credit manager,
Herrin Supply Co.
Rev. W. G. Storey, pastor First
Christian church.
City Aldermen C. G. Copeland,
Thomas Welty, Chas. E. Dunham, Al
vin Misker, Carl Nall. (Five out of
eight members.)
Confidence In Yonng
The best citizens of the county
have the utmost confidence in S,
Glenn Young, who was sent here at
the request of a citizens’ committee
that could no longer tolerate the opera
defiance of the law that had come to
be characteristic of Williamson
county. Endorsed by high govern
ment officials, and empowered by U.
S. authorities to act, Young was as
sured by the Klan that he would
have the active co-operation of mem
bers of that organization when need
ed, and its moral and financial sup
port at all times.
He is not a stranger in this sec
tion. Young remarked to me, with
a characteristic grin, -“no wonder
these fellows that we’ve locked up
don’t like me. and that the bootleg
gers we’ve raided think that I’m »
nuisance, to say the least of it. Four
years ago, when I was a federal
agent here, I arrested practically the
same crowd on very similar charges
that have gotten them into trouble
this time.”
In addition to the hold that his
duties have, a sentimental attach
ment makes Mr. Young feel at home
here. His wife, too, feels that Her
rin is her home, for her father,
George B. Simcox, was for nine years
United States marshal in this dis
trict and she is widely acquainted
throughout Williamson and surround
ing counties. The Youngs have •
small son, who with his mother, are
the inspiration behind that fearless
“two-gun” upholder of law and or
der, S. Glenn Young.
