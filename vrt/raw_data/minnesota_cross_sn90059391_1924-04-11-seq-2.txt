For Johnson Measure

WASHINGTON, I). C.. April 7.
tfjuiiuel Gompers. president of the
American Federation of Labor, is out
with a statement putting immigra
tion first of nine measures which he
puts immigration ahead of the rail
tvad settlement which labor favors
at this session of congress.
The report of the federation’s leg
islative committee declares that the
Johnson immigration bill, providing
for a two per cent quota and the ad
mission of families of foreign-born
citizens, is being “maliciously at
tacked in foreign countries, by their
astionals in the United States” and
by “unfair and greedy corporations.
“Mussolini declares that if the bill
la enacted into law that less money
will be sent back to Italy to the rel
atives of Italian immigrants. And
the Ital ian ambassador has been di
rected to make protest to our gov
ernment.
Itumannlans Protest
“The Rumanian government has
Bade a similar protest, declaring, as
Aid Mussolini, that the economic re
cuperation of that country depends
apon money sent by immigrants to
their families who remained at home.
“Former Attorney General Wicker
jfaam opposes the bill because it for
bids the admission of “aliens ineligi
ble to citizenship.' Mr. Wickersham
far many years has represented Ja
panese interests in this country. In
some way the Federal Council of
Churches has been led into opposing
that feature of the Johnson bill. It
aays that it would be a case of bad
faith to pass a law that will abolish
the ‘gentleman’s Agreement’ but
■ever says a word about how Japan
has time and time again violated
that agreement.
“It must not be forgotten that the
'gentleman’s agreement’ is not a
treaty. In this case the ‘gentleman’s
agreement’ leaves to Japan the issu
ing of passports for those who intend
to come to the United States. No

one has ever seen this ‘gentleman’s
agreement’ and it is believer! to be
on the same order as ‘gentleman’s
agreements’ between corporations for
profiteering purposes or for determin
ing wages and the blacklisting of la
bor.
“It was a verbal agreement. Japan
is said to have given a pledge to is
sue no passports to laborers.
ever, they come in here as merchants,
students or under some other classi
fication, but soon throw off their dis
guise and become laborers.
.Many Japanese
“There are 100,000 Japanese in Cal
ifornia alone. The federal council of
churches is also urging that the Ja
panese come under the 2 per cent
quota. President Gompers has made
a protest to that organization and it
is hoped the influence that led it
into such a mistake will be exposed.
“The January and February reports
of the United States employment
service show a surplus of labor, es
pecially of what is designated as un
skilled labor, in nearly every indus
trial city and town in the United
States.
“There are many members of con
gress who would note for the com
plete restriction program, but the
number is not sufficient to enact
such legislation. The evidence given
before the immigration committees
are of such a nature that even the
committeemen were astounded.
“If a new immigration law is en
acted before June 30, 1924, the law
of 1917 will become operative. Under
that law immigration to this coun
try is almost unlimited. Before the
passage of the 3 per cent law, 100,-
000 immigrants were coming here
each month. Secretary of Labor
Davis has said there are 10,000,000
people in Europe who are anxious to
come to America. It will thus De
seen that the danger ahead of the
United States cannot be lightly treat
ed.”
Joseph M. Owens, of Washington,
tells the truth and gets over im
portant facts when he writes as fol
lows:
“WTiy do the manufacturers’ asso
ciations advocate unrestricted immi
gration and at the same time call
for an increased tariff on foreign
goods? Would not unrestricted immi
gration injure American labor just as
free trade would destroy our indus
tries? The big corporations are al
ways sending out propaganda about
the radical and foreign element, and
they are the very ones who encour
age them to come here. They believe
in passing laws to increase their
wealth and at the same time help to
destroy American labor by an in
crease in the immigration of cheap
labor. Every genuine American, re
gardless of politics, should support
the Johnson immigration bill now
pending before the house.”

Theodore Itnrton, of Ohio, Takes
Stand for Japanese
1 hi migration
(Iturc.in uf Publication and I duration)
WASHINGTON, I). C.. April 5
Thousands and thousands of letters,
petitions and memorials are being
sent to Hon. Albert Johnson, chair
man of the house immigration com
mittee. in Washington, in behalf ot'
the house bill.. Hundreds and hun
dreds of these letters are coming
right out of New York city and
Biooklyn. where there are so many
foreigners. The writers of same know
that it is useless for them to ask
their own congressmen to support
the bill, so they are writing to other
members of congress because they
know the congressmen from New
Vork city districts are against them
and favorable to the many aliens in
their districts. Here, is a sample ot
the thousands of letters that are
coming:
“As the immediate restriction of
immigration is vitally necessary to
the welfare of our country, the un
dersigned, a resident and voter of
New York, earnestly believes:
“1. That the need is for a
complete stoppage of immigra
tion for a period of at least five
years.
2. That the maximum conces
sion to be tolerated would be a
two per cent quota based upon
the immigration census of 1890,
as provided for in the Johnson
bill.
“3. That there is great need
for a national alien registration
law. providing for registration
of all aliens and the immediate
deportation of those unlawfully
here.
“Further, as the unassimibilitv of
certain races is apparent, there
should be no hesitancy in saying so
in plain F!nglish and taking an open
course without subterfuge to limit
their entry.
“Realizing the futility of address
ing congressmen from New York city
who for obvious reasons have aleady
put themselves on record as oppos
ing leal restrictive immigration, this
letter is sent to you as the outstand
ing spokesman of true Americanism.”
In the Senate
Over in the senate things are get
ting hotter and hotter for a more
restrictive immigration bill than has
been reported to that body by the
senate committee. An amendment has
been proposed by Senator Harris, of
Georgia, proposing to reduce the
quota from 2 per cent to 1 per cent
and base the computation on the
census of 1890 instead of 1910.
Senator Harrison, of Mississippi,
has proposed an amendment, to base
the 2 per cent quota on the census of
1890.
There is a rumor going today that
special efforts will be made to get
the senate immigration bill up in the
senate before the house bill can come
up in the house, realizing that the
pressure all over the country is get
ting so great that the alien influ
ence over on the senate side is get
ting scared about so many thou
sands of people writing and wiring in
their requests for a more restrictive
immigration than has been proposed
in the senate bill.

Criminal Waste Found in Public Offices
BY TWILIGHT
From time to time we read about
extravagances in the expenditure of
public funds and frequently we are
presented with facts that conclusive
ly prove that public officials are
criminally wasteful in the use ot
money that has been accumulated by
taxation. Investigations that have
taken place during the past year
show, beyond the possibility of a
doubt, that the people’s money is not
properly safe-guarded. It is time
to call a halt and demand a strict ac
counting to all the public officials
who in any way handle public money.
Wasteful expenditures have increased
the tax rate and placed heavy bur
dens upon the citizens of this nation.
It is not strange that the taxpayer is
becoming rebellious and demand spe
cific actions which will bring im
mediate relief.
Congressman Johnson, of Kentucky,
brought forward some facts pertain
ing to the reckless expenditure of
public funds that should receive the
attention of all those who are inter
ested in the welfare of the nation.
When the war ended, there was a
large accumulation of supplies which
were intended to be used in the mil
itary activities centered in Europe.
These accumulations with the Arm
istice immediately became surplus.
Obviously it was best to dispose of
these supplies by some methods that
would bring satisfactory returns to
the government. Public auctions
were accordingly arranged for the
disposal of surplus supplies. In these
auctions the government carried all
the expenses of the sale and then
paid a j>ercentage for “crying the
sale.’’ It develops that the auc
tioneers worked about thirty minutes
on a given sale. Some of the re
sults that have now been made pub
lic will be studied with much inter
est.

MANY FOREIGN AGENCIES OPPOSED
TO RESTRICTIVE IMMIGRATION BILL
The senate of the United States
will soon have to decide whether it
will pass an immigration law for the
benefit of America and Americans,
or for the benefit of Houmania, Italy,
Poland, Japan, and points east and
south.
Roumania objects to the legislation
desired by Americans because it will
decrease remittances by Roumaniains
so he brags, to work for the defeat
of the immigration bill by taking up
the culgels for Japan under the guise
of an international pacifist.
Will Mr. Burton please explain his
favoring the abrogation of the treaty
of peace with Russia during Taft’s
administration?
Will the Cleveland man also ex
plain how he as a Republican can
argue for a high protective tariff on
the products of foreign pauper la
bor, and then turn around and argue
for and vote for free trade in the
foreign pauper labor, cheap labor
itself even cheap coolie Japanese
labor?
Mr. Burton has been heard many,
many times talking about party re
gularity in both the house and sen
ate. He has an opportunity to put it
into practice now. Has his recent
sojourn in New York with the Jewish
banking interests and his represen
tation of a district in which there
are bunches of foreigners anything
to do with his entrance into the fore
ign bloc in the house
If he seeks re-election he should
want the vote of all good Americans
as well as the foreigners.
Two Presidents for Immigration
President Coolidge in his last an
nual message to congress made a ter
rific unanswerable argument for a
restrictive immigration bill. His
late lamented predecessor, Warren G.
Harding, in his inaugural message
stood squarely on his last platform
demanding rigorous retriction of
foreign immigration.

to this country. Italy objects be
cause she feels that she needs a ref
uge for her surplus population. Ja
pan objects because she feels that
her feelings are in danger of being
hurt. Poland, it is reported, objects
not only to immigration but to the
“Americanization of such Poles as
are here and is said to have asked the
Vatican to intervene.
Indiana and North Dakota. Texas
and Michigan do not object. They
are tired of paying the bills for im
migrant insanity, pauperism, crime
and lawlessness. In former days they
were rather proud that America was
an “Asylum ior the oppressed.” Now
they know that unless immigration
is stopped or radically changed, Amer
ica can justly be called an asylum
for idiots, and we will be the idiots.
Europe seems to consider us an asy
lum for her incompetents, defectives,
deliquents and criminals.
The senate of the United States
should restore the 1890 census to
the immigration bill as the basis for
quotas. It should do so because it is
the sensible thing to do and because
it is in the interest of America. The
interest of America should precede in
the estimation of the senate the in
terest of the other countries of the
world. Alien blocs in our great cit
ies, faithfully representing the coun
tries to which their hearts give alle
giance. have brought pressure to bear
upon the senate to eliminate the 1890
census as quota basis. The senate
can choose between the alternative
of pleasing foreign groups or pleas
ing the Americans.

Some will insist that this is a par
tisan political matter. Nothing how
ever, could be further from the truth
than a contention of that kind. Mr.
Johnson has found that the records
show where of $11,870,097.83, the war
department spent 15 per cent during
the Wilson administration and 85 per
cent under the Harding and Coolidge
should receive our consideration, is
whether or not the expenditure are
being continued with the reckless
ness of the past. In spite of all the
investigations that are taking place
at the present time another one seems
to be in order.
Something must be done to curb
the laxity in the business of govern
ment. Tne demagog in his frantic
efforts to line up votes shouts for
efficiency snd economy. The voter is
getting sick and tired of his phrase
ology and childish promises.
V/ipjWa&s from Washington
(Bureau of IMibllrallnn and Kduratlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C., April I.—
Copies of the resolutions approving
a maximum surtax rate of 25 per
cent recently passed by the tax con
ference at Asheville, North Carolina,
have been officially filed with mem
bers of the senate finance committee
by a special committee of the Ameri
can Bankers’ league, composed of W.
T. Old, of the Seaboard National bank
Norfolk. Virginia; Joseph G. Brown,
of the Citizens National bank, of Ral
eigh, North Carolina; and J. Elwood
Cox, of the Commercial National
bank, High Point, North Carolina.
Since the passage of the resolu
tions, signatuers have been securer
from approximately 2500 banks in the
southern states approving the 25 per
cent surtax rate as adopted at the
Asheville conference, and these sig
natures were made part of the ex
hibit filed with the committee.
North Carolina heads the list with
more than 300 signatures, indicating
that the bankers of that state will
stand behind the rate adopted at
Asheville.
Officials of the American Banker
league anticipate that 90 per cent of
the of the south .will approve
the rates before the canvass is com
plete. Additional signatures will be
filed with the senate finance commit
tee when received, it is stated.

Harry F. Sinclair, oil man. has been
indicted on ten counts by the federal
grand jury of the District of Colum
bia on a charge of contempt of the
United States senate because of his
refusal to answer questions before the
senate committee investigating the
oil question.
It’‘s a dangrous position for any
man to take, viz., refuse to testify or
answer questions when on the witness
stand. When a man won’t, there is
usually found a way to make him re
verse himself.
Nine counts deal with Sinclair’s re
fusal to answer nine separate ques
tions put to him by Senator Walsh,
prosecutor of the committee. The
tenth count deals with the general
refusal of Sinclair to answer all
questions.

The Order Sons of Italy, incorpo

in its declared objects and purposes
is organized “To unite in one sole
family all the Italians scattered
through America; to help keep burn

therland (Italy); to be a school of
mutual benefit; to take part in any
colonial initiative or movement the
way best suited to circumstances; to
convince brothers of the Order that
taking an active part in the political
life of America is a factor for social
betterment, and the Order will en

Can’t Be Too Careful
Congresman Mooney and Burton,
of Cleveland, Ohio, and about 50 oth
er members of the house out of a to
tal of 435 members, say the Johnson
immigration bill is unfair and un-
American, because it seeks to cut for
eign immigration from three to two
per cent and requiring immigrants to
be examined on the European side of
the big pond so relatives, friends
and politicians on this side will not
be af>le to pull in the defective, de
generate and criminal aliens who are
held up by immigration officers at
our ports of entry.
It is unfair to America to let down
the bars and let in about half a mil
lion. On the other hand, why not be
careful and keep out the alien insane,
the feeble minded, the paupers and
the criminal class? Our public insti
tutions are full of foreigners, as it
is, costing our taxpayers millions of
dollars.
