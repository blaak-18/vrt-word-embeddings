TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
I have a suggestion which I wish
to make to you, it is this: That the
young men of the United States form
a league to be known as the Young
Men’s National Populist League, for
the purpose of aiding the Populist
party in its great campaign for what
is right.
That this league be a national or
ganization, with branches in every
State in the Union, and smaller
branches in each county in every
State.
Now, young man, do you want to
live all your life trampled on by the
corporations? I answer, one for all,
NO! So this league will be organ
ized to help the people’s party in its
great fight for the common people vs.
corporations.
Now, young man, it is your duty
to your country, to yourself, and to
generations not yet born, to aid in
helping the common people get out
from under the rule of corporations.
You ask how can this be done?
By organizing in your county imme
diately a county branch of the Young
Men’s Populist National League and
aid in this great fight.
Now, young men, think over this
suggestion, write your views to the
Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga., or to me
personally at Oxford, Ga., if public
sentiment, is favorable at the present
time.
I suppose you think I am asking a
great deal of you, but I have one
more favor which I desire to ask, and
it is that you write a constitution for
the League and publish in next
week’s Jeffersonian.
Hoping that our movement will
prove a great success and again
thanking you for your aid,
I am very truly yours,
WILL H. STANFORD.
< Oxford, Ga.
Ed. Note: We heartily favor Will
Stanford’s suggestion.
If the young men will take hold
and organize, things will happen.
Whenever we receive a letter con
taining the statement, “I voted for
Peter Cooper,” we can’t keep out the
thought,—‘‘Here is a veteran too old
to go to the wars again.” We love
and honor every one of these aged
heroes, but we can not expect them to
again shoulder the heavy load of ac
tive reform work.
The young are, in tall respects,
‘‘the hope of the country.” To them
we must look for zeal, enthusiasm,
daring and arduous effort.
If we can only enlist the boys and
the younger men, we can yet rout
the marauders who, under forms of
law, are systematically robbing the
producers of wealth.
If we can organize the youth of
the land, we will put an end to the
villanous law-making, by legislators
and by usurping judges, that is tak
ing all surplus production from the
toilers, who create it, and giving it
to the millionaires who produce
nothing.
We welcome Will Stanford’s prop
osition. Who will join his band?

FROM PARIS, FRANCE —A GEOR
GIA BOY SUCCEEDS THERE.
My Dear Sir:—During my visit to
my son Donald I have read with in
tense interest your Life of Napoleon.
No other history gives so many in
teresting details of the great man’s
life and times, and it does seem to
me every reading Frenchman would
read this book and thank you for
writing it.
The people of England should
even now feel ashamed (if they have
such a feeling) of their treachery
and meanness in dealing with one of
the greatest men, I think, that ever
lived.
Donald has just handed me your
magazine for August and I have
read the first article, and you have
knocked out the “bull’s eye” in it.
I served four years in the Bth
Georgia regiment in the late war.
With great respect,
Yours truly,
CHAS. M. HARPER.
Paris, August 11, 1909.
P. S.—My boy has achieved a
wonderful success in this great and
beautiful city.
Ed. Note: We most heartily con
gratulate both the Harpers, father
and son. It is astonishing and grati
fying in the extreme to see so many
of the sons of old Georgia winning
their way in so many distant parts
of the world. —T. E. W.
HOW ABOUT THE MILLEDGE
VILLE REFORMATORY?
Dear Sir: —I had a son, 16 years
of age, who was sent to the State
Reformatory at Milledgeville in
April, 1908, and some few days ago
he got away and was located at Ath
ens, Ga., and before he was carried
back I paid him a visit in person and
had a physician to examine him, and
found he had a very bad case of
syphilis and had been stabbed in the
side, and had not been sent to school
one day since he had been assigned
to the Reformatory. Don’t think I
can submit to this treatment of my
child at their hands and wish to se
cure his release and at the same
time recover damages for their neg
lect of ciuty to my son since in their
care and under their jurisdiction.
Please advise me what you would
take the case for and work it for all
there is in it.
Respectfully,
» CITIZEN.
Winder, Ga., Aug. 31, 1909.
SOCIALIST DECEIT—JUST AS WE
SAID.
Dear Sir: —I note that you are go
ing to have some articles against So
cialism, and in this connection I will
say that either the Socialist party
has changed or its speakers are try
ing to win public favor by misrepre
sentation.
W. W. McAllister spoke for So
cialism at Parma Friday night and he
laid down this proposition:
“Socialism does not intend to in
terfere with private property, private
ownership of property, except those
things which are public in their
nature —railroads, telegraph, etc.”
He made one of the best Populist
speeches I have heard for a long
time.
Now this is the Populist principle
to a dot, and if Socialism stands for
this principle there is no reason why
Populists should not all become So-
cialists — but the point is does Social
ism really occupy that ground, or
does it stand for Communism, the
man to be the servant of the State,
and no longer free to feast or starve,
as he wishes?
Yours truly,
JOS. A. PARKER.
Parma, Mo., Aug. 30, 1909.
Ed. Note: The above letter con
firms what I have said about the de
ceitfulness of Socialist speakers and
writers.
They don’t put forward the real
creed of Socialism. They dare not.
They know that our people would
spurn it if they did.
Consequently, they come up on the
blind side of their hearers by preach
ing Populism.
With the October issue of the
magazine, I will begin the exposure
of these hypocrites.—T. E. W.
GLAD TO GET MISSION DUST OUT
OF PEOPLE’S EYES.
Dear Sir:—l w’ant to thank you
for throwing light on the Foreign
Mission subject. The people have
been begged and tormented about
these collections until there are
many who have ceased to go to
church at all. The preachers say
that you ought not to have bothered
that question at all. I want to say
that I am with you and am glad
“that you have got the dust laid.” I
just want to compliment and thank
you for turning in the light. I have
alw’ays been your friend.
As ever,
L. M. KERSY.

REFORM PAPERS.
I see another reform paper had to
give up the ghost. It is sad indeed
to think that the people are so in
different to their own interests.
When I look back thirty years and
see the noble men and women who
have given their means and lives to
the cause of Populism it seems
enough to discourage any one; but
I must say I tried to do my part and
have always had a reform paper,
though I was often hardly able to
raise the price. I have followed to
their grave such papers as Pomeroy’s
Democrat, Chicago Sentinel and Ex
press, Nonconformist, Nebraska In
dependent, Corning Nation, and Peo
ple’s Party Paper, edited by Mr.
Watson. But I still had the Mis
souri World till it finally had to give
up the fight. I met the editor at
the St. Louis convention and he
looked as though his health was
gone. But we still have Watson and
his Jeffersonians. I watched him in
Congress and know how he was lied
about and cheated out of his seat
in Congress, but there is one thing
they can’t cheat him out of and that
is every mail box on the rural route
stands as a monument to his memory
for the short time he was allowed to
be in Congress.
Mr. Watson, this may be taking
too much of your valuable time, but
I must congratulate you on the way
you have been stirring up the preach
ers and exposing the fallacies of For
eign Mission, and, as you say, every
dollar of missionary money should
be used at home.
Your subscriber,
ALBERT LONG.
Williamsfield, 111.
