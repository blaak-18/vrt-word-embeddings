Should the tree be planted i»
treeless wastes of Spain, there sfs
no doubt but its effects would be
most, advantageous in creating
rains and ^improving the climate.
In Corsica, too, its presence would
bu a blessing. In the sixteenth
century this island was richly wood
ed, but, by a reckless disregard of
consequences, it has been entirely
denuded of trees.
, A decoction of the Eucalyptus is
said by physicians who have used
it in the malàriait fevers of tropical
countries to be eqnal to quiniiitt as
a tonic, and numbers of cares have
been effected by it where th»latter
medicine had failed. Many differ
erent medical prepapartious have
already been obtained from the
tree, which are recommended iu
intermittent fevers, consumption,
rheumatism, sbrofula au<l other
diseases. Various preparations use
ful in arts and industries have also
been manufactured, such as tracing
pa|>er, a preservative for iusects
and anatomical specimens Eu
calyptus oil, etc*.
The trees absorb an enormous
qnautity of moisture from the soil,
and, when planted in marshy lands,
speedily drain them dry. The
volatile exhalations which they give
off correct a malarial atmosphere
and make it pure and wholesome.
Many instantes are quoted where
fever has prevailed iu certain locali
ties, rendering them almost unten
able, nutil the Eucalyptus was
planted, when, in the coarse of a
year and a half, the climate would
experience a total change, and
healthfuiuess be permanently es
tablished.
The Eucalyptus belongs to the
myrtle family, 'and is evergreeu.
There arê a number of species,
mostly natives of Australia—a few
occurring in the Malay Archipela
go. The leaves are entire aud
leathery.— Chicago Tribune.
BP For the first time in years the
supply of shingles in the Alexandria
market is exhausted. It hns for some

two things ; that the rains and

encouraging sign.
