WATCH THE DATE ON THE LABEL!
“Under the new postal regulations, weekly and monthly publications are
allowed a limited time to collect subscriptions, and they are not permitted to
carry the names of delinquent subscribers beyond a certain date.
“Our subscribers will help us greatly if they will keep an eye on the date
when their subscriptions expire, as shown by the labels; and by renewing at
or before expiration they will save us the trouble of calling their attention to
the fact.
“A postal card sent to a subscriber to notify him that his time is out is
not a dun; it is a gentle reminder that if he does not renew in a short time,
his name will be dropped ’from the mailing lists, in accordance with the lawi
“Watch the date on the label!’’

TOM WATSON MELON—72 lbs.
'rhe very best and most attractive melon ever
put on the market, it is long and dark green
in color, and its eating quality has no supe
rior, it keeps longer than any other melon after
ripening, and is one of the best shipping mel
ons grown; it will make more money for those
who plant it than any other.
The above melon did not originate with the
Alexandria Seed Co., as their catalog indi
cates, but was first grown in this section by
the undersigned, the only authorized seller of
the seed under the above name.
