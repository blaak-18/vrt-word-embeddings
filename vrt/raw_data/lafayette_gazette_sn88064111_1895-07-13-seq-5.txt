A fEFINERY
Will, in all Probability, be Built
on M~r. C. A. _loutol's Place.
It may be stated as reasonably
certain that a refinery will be built
on Mr. Chas. A. -Mouton's place
near this town. Through the efforts
of Col. Gus. A. Breaux, the bulk!
of the capital necessary to build a
good-sized mill has been secured
from persons in New Orleans to
which has been added subscriptions
from citizens of this town and vici
nity obtained by committees of gen
tlemen who have been at work since
several days. At a meeting of the
different committees held at Falk's
Opera House Thursday evening
Col. Breaux made a statement ex
planatory of the cost of the refinery,
its size and dimensions. He said
that its capacity would be 300 tons
per day; the building 150 feet
long, 40 feet wide and 20 feet high;
boiler sheds, 4o b3 75 feet.
The local committees have suc
ceeded in placing 37 shares at $100oo,
and as the amount to be raised here
is $5000, only $1300oo remains to be
subscribed. This, it is believed,
will be easy to raise.
In his remarks before the- cori
miittees, Col. Breaux stated that
Mr. Taylor, an experienced and
competent contractor, was expected
to arrive shortly to look over the
site to make the necessary prepa
rations to lay the foundation as
soon a practicable. It is intended
to begin work not later than next
week. The refinery is to be com
pleted and ready for operation on
the 14th of October, 1895, in time to
grind the coming cane crop. It
is estimated that the capacity of
the mill will be sufficiently large
to "take off" all the cane raised
within a reasonable distance, and
we understand that it will be
built in such a way as to enable an
increase of capacity should if be
come necessary.
Heretofore farmers in this sec
tion have encountered great diffi
culties in having their cane shipped
to marketable points, and a refinery
within reach of their fields will be
of incalculable benefit to them.
Unless the t:nexpectel should hap
pen and with average good fortune
the intelligent work of Col. ,Breaux
and the prompt assistance given
by the, Ial.e:s -Mlet's Association
and its cotinnittees will bear fruit
anl i.afayette will lave that long
wisled! for refinery.

A DESPERATE DARKY'S
I)astardly Attempt to Take the
Lit' of Mr. Felix Landry.
Some people may not know it,
but it is nevertheless a fact that the
hobo element or that class of itiner
ant loafers who ride on freight
trains free of charge, are, with pro
bably few exceptions, in the habit
of carrying weapons concealed
about their persons. So common
has this practice grown of late that
the lives of railroad trainmen are in
imminent danger if these worthies
are not allowed to ride without mo
lestation. We have been informed
that the negro-hoboes are Invaria
bly "heeled" and they have gotten
to be so bold that upon what they
consider to be the slightest p.ovo
cation they bring their death-deal
ing instruments into active service.
Some time ago Sheriff Broussard
arrested on the railroad tract a num
ber of suspicious negroes, and when
searched two of them were found
in the possession of revolvers. Both
are now languishing in jail. An
endless number of cases may be
cited to illustrate this daily increasing
danger to the lives of the trainmen
who are called at every hour to
evict from the train these desperate
men.
Last Monday night at about half
past nine o'clock when the local
freight was pulling in at the yards,
Felix Landry, a brakeman, noticed
a negro comfortably seated on a
flat car. He walked up to him and
asked him what he wanted. The
negro explained his mission in lan
guage more forcible than elegant
and at the same time drew a pistol
and fired at Mr. Landry who fortu
nately received the bullet in a
fleshy part of his right arm inflict
ing only a very slight wound. The
negro then seemed satisfied with his
devilish work and for a while held his
pistol pointed at his defenseless
victim who had but one thing to do
and that was to submit to his mur
derous assailant. When the train
stopped the negro jumped off and
made his escape. The authorities
were informed of the occurrence
and the necessary measures were
taken to capture the would-be mur
derer, who has not yet been caught,
but l)eputy Sheriff Mouton acted
promptly in the matter and it is be
lieved that he will be behind the
bars before mnany days.
