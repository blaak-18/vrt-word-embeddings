An Interesting Debate by
the Saturday Night Club
The Saturday Night Club is an or
ganization of young men residing in
Atlanta, and who meet each week to
discuss current events.
On the night of March 19th an
unusually interesting debate was ar
ranged, the subject being, “Resolved,
That the people of the United States
should pay less money to Foreign
Missions.’’
J. E. McGinley, a young man of
eighteen, won with a splendid argu
ment, for the affirmative.
The article shows that Mr. McGin
ley had carefully studied his subject.
The debate was held in the Uni
versalist church in Atlanta, and a
large audience enjoyed the debate,
giving close attention to both sides,
but agreeing with the judges that
the affirmative had presented an un
answerable argument. Mr. McGin
ley said:
“Mr. President, religious missions
is an organized method of propagat
ing religious beliefs. Specifically,
the propagation of Christianity
among the heathen, based on the
command of Christ: “Go ye into all
the world and preach the gospel to
every creature,” and the command
has been obeyed unto this day, and
will be until the end of the world.
“Paul, the first great missionary
after Christ, went about preaching
the gospel among the Jews; when
the Jews refused to listen to him, he
preached to the Gentiles. This work
has been kept up by those who fol
lowed him, but it has been s so alter
ed that it causes poverty among the
people of this nation, Christian and
non-Christian.
“Our country gives yearly millions
of dollars for the purpose of main
taining Foreign Missions. In the
last four years 4,000 of the college
graduates of our country have gone
as missionaries to foreign countries.
These missionaries are sent to va
rious parts of the world; to China,
India, South America, Mexico, Afri
ca, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal,
Spain, and many other places. The
greatest number go to China, India
and Africa.
“Tn China there is a population of
400,000,000, mostly heathen. Sup
pose each of these heathen can be
converted at a cost of S2O, the
amount would be $8,000,000,000. If
we would offer China that amount
now, we would not have to waste
years of energy to get them to claim
Christianity. These missionaries,
besides being furnished with abun
dant luxuries themselves, also fur
nish the heathen with colleges, hos
pitals, missions and dispensaries. In
1907 there were 1,162 hospitals and
dispensaries maintained in the for
eign fields, in which 2,347,780 pa
tients were treated. In 1907 Europe
and America gave $21,280,147 to
Foreign Missions.
“Confucianism is the basis of the
social and political system of the
Chinese. It has been professed, and
is still the belief of all classes. Many

of the young men of the higher class
are sent to Europe and the United
States for instruction in English and
the sciences, but they never leave
their own country to be converted to
the Christian religion. They don’t
want to become Christians; they
proved it by the Boxer uprising in
which a great many missionaries
were killed. Bribery by money,
food, schools and hospitals are the
means being used to induce the Chi
nese to change their religious belief.
“In Africa, the missionaries build
fine brick houses for the black heath
en, who are used to living in the or
dinary African hut. They are so
anxious to convert and educate these
negroes that they buy African or
phans in all parts of Africa. After
all this effort in Africa, Mohamme
.danism has won more converts in the
last fifty years than has Christi
anity.
We are sending missionaries to
France, Italy, Spain and Portugal
where church work is thoroughly or
ganized, and every person is afforded
the opportunity to obtain an educa
tion.
Why not make each mission sup
port itself?
Has all the teaching, made possi
ble in the past fifty years by millions
of American dollars, failed to teach
these heathens how to support them
selves and their schools? WHY?
The missionaries are supplied with
all conveniences. They have beauti
ful homes to live in, one in the city
during the winter, and one in the
mountains during the summer. These
homes are supplied with beautiful
furniture of every kind, which only
the well-to-do American can afford.
The dentists and doctors are sup
plied with the best of material and
implements with which to do their
work, so the heathen can have the
best work that money can afford.
Some of the missionaries give vast
ly more attention to political affairs
than to preaching the gospel.
Before we get too deeply interest
ed in the heathen and the foreign
countries, let us look at the condi
tions that exist in our own country.
If you doubt the need of enlarged
home mission effort, study the cities,
the mountain districts, the frontier.
Consider the overwhelming percent
age of non-Christian population, and
read of the tremendous emigration of
people of the earth into America. It
has been shown by statistics, that for
every heathen converted there are
ten unconverted people who enter
this country.
Out of a population of 90,000,000
in the United States only thirty-two
million make any claim to be Chris
tians. If the missionaries are so ea
ger to convert people, why don’t they
grasp the great opportunity afforded
them in this country. While the mis
sionaries are in foreign lands bribing
the heathen to become Christians,
and clothing and feeding them, there
are thousands of Christians in this
country who are begging for fuel,
food, clothes and homes. We are
neglecting our own flesh and blood
when we donate money to Foreign
Missions.
The statistical abstract of the Uni
ted States shows that there were over
83,000 paupers in the almhouses of
this country during 1908. Statistics
also show that 97 per cent, of the in
mates of almshouses, prisons and re
form schools in the United States are
foreigners. Wouldn’t it be a great
deal better to spend the money it
takes to maintain these institutions,
in educating the people and prevent
ing such conditions? We have here
in Georgia 63,329 people over ten
years of age who can neither read
nor write.
We have thousands of men in this
country who do not ask for a life half
as good as we give the heathen in
foreign lands, but who are begging
for any kind of work to keep from
starving.

There never was a time when con
ditions in America called more loud
ly for a larger advance by mission
aries in their home mission work.
We have here in the South and in
Georgia alone conditions existing
which can not be equaled in heath
endom.
We Protestants are donating
money to feed the heathen, to cloth
him, by taking it away from our own
people. Oh, where is the logic in
this? Where is the philanthropy in
it?
The people of the United States
should donate less to Mis
sions, because the tremendous sums
of money spent have shown inade
quate results.
Because we are trying to preach a
doctrine where a doctrine has al
ready existed for hundreds of
years.

of.
Because statistics show that, by
our lax emigration methods, it is
costing the United States thousands
of dollars to care for the criminals
and paupers that come into this
country from foreign lands.
Finally, as a people, we can not
afford to neglect our own poor and
ignorant, to care for the poor and
ignorant of other countries.
And Foreign Mission work, as now
conducted, accomplishes nothing for
God nor man.
