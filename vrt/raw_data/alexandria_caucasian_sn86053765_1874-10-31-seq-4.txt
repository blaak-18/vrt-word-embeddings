Grateful Thonsands proclaim
V inegar B itteks the moat wonder
ful Invigorant that over sustained
tbo sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted bevotid repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
prevalent in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout tho United States,
especially thoso of tho Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during tho
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, aro invariably ac
companied by extonsivo derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influenco upon these vari
ous organs, is essontially necessary.
There is 110 cathartic for the purpose
equal to Du. J. Walker's Venegak
Bittkrn , as they will speedily remove
tho dark-colored viscid matter with which
tho bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating tho secretions of tho liver,
and generally restoring tho healthy func
tions of the digestivo organs. g
Fortify tlie body agaiust dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
Yikkoau Bitters . No epidemic can
take hold of a system thus fore-armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, Head
ache, Pain in the Shoulders, Coughs,
Tightness of tbo Chest, Diuineas, Sour
Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste
in the Month, Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of tho Heart, Inflammation of the
Lungs, Pain in the region of the Kidneys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
aro the offsprings of Dyspepsia. One bot
tlo will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrofula, or King 's Evil, Whito
Swellings, Ulcers, Erysipelas, Swelled
Neck, Goitre, Scrofulous Inflammation«,
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of the Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, Walker's Vib
eoarBittkrs have shown their great cur
ative powers in the moat obstinato and
intractablo cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of tho Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
theso Bitters have 110 equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.— Persons
engaged in Paints and Minorais, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, aro sub
ject to paralysis of tho Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of Walker's
"Vinkoar Bitters occasionally.
For Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Tetter, Salt-Kheum, Blotches, Spots, Pim
ples, Pustiilea, Boils, Carbuncles, Ring
worms, Scald-head, Soro Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurfs, Discolorations of the
Skin, Humors and Diseases of the Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug np and carried ont of the system in a
short timo by the uso of theso Bittors.
vpin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in tho system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelmintics will freo the
system from worms liko theso Bitters.
For Female Complaints, in young
or old, married or single, at tho dawn of
womanhood, ortho turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so dccided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you lind ita impurities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores ; cleanse it when you find it ob
structed and sluggish in tho veins; cleanse
it when it is foul ; your feelings will toll
you when. Keep tho blood pure, and the
health of tho system will follow.

THE INSTITUTION OFFERS SÜPERI
orfacilities for instruction; its loca
tion is healthy and accessible; and the
society and religious influences of Baton
Rouge are good
For two years past, the UNIVERSITY,
altho a State School, has had no State pa
tronage, and very little private support,
still it survives ; and with the dawn of
tho brighter and better day—now, no
doubt, near at hand—for the State and
people, onr School must reap tho reward
of it« pnticnt endnrance, under long sufl'er
iiiR and neglect ; it will be duly apprecia
ted, we hope, by tbe people, and become
wlint it was designed to be, an institution
of lenrning, worthy of a great State, aud
of a free and prosperous people.
COMMERCE and enlightenment go
band in band together. The Geographi
cal and Commercial positions of La., will
in spite of all present drawbacks, soon
fore« greatness upon her.
NEW OÎÎLEAN8 will become popnlons
and rich beyond the expectation of tho
most sanguine now» and here, almost in
its suburbs, on the first bluff from the sea,
yet on the bank of the great River, will
be, in time, the chief School of the
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY,
and we iimnf, patiently abide on time—
lenrn to labor and to wait.
THE CITIZENS of Louisiana and of tho
adjoining Sfatc». are respectfully request
ed to co:iHÎ<lrr tlie ndvantages, which tbe
UNIVERSITY afford» fur the education
of their sons, .ni.l to accord it that mi |>
port, of which they may deem it worthy.
