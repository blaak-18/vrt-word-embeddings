LEE AT SHARPSBURG.
After the longest, bloodiest, and
most dreadful baitle had been fought
during the war, at Sharpsburg, Mary
land, in 1862; after the sun had
gone down and hid its rays from
one of the most bloody scenes known
to history, and all had gotten quiet,
the two great line of battle still con
fronting each ether, resting from
their awful butcheries of the day,
General Lee look his stand in the
center and rear of his lines on
‘ 'Traveler” at about 10 p. m., and
sent for all of his division command
ers. As each one would come up
General Lee would ask him, “How is
it along your line, General?” They
would say, “Bad enough,” and their
• losses had been terrible, and would
wind up by advising that the army
had best cross iLe river before morn
ing. Finally General Hood rode up
and when asked the same question
by General Lee, General Hood could
hardly talk he was so much aggrieved
at his terrible losses. General Lee
straightened himself up on the back
of “Traveler” and said, “Why, Gen
eral Hood, where is that splendid di
vision I saw you in command of this
morning?” General Hood replied,
“General Lee, they lie upon the field
yonder where you sent them today,”
pointing toward the field. After tbe
consultation was over General Lee
straightened himself in his saddle and
said, “Gentlemen, go to your com
mands; if Geneial McClellan wants
battle tomorrow, we will give it to
him.”

THE FIERY CROSS.
“Like heath-bird the hawks pursue,
A barge Loch Kathrine flew;
High stood the henchman on the prow,
So rapidly the bargemen row,
The bubbles, where they launched the
boat,
Were all unbroken and afloat,
Dancing in foam and ripple still,
When it had near’d the main-land
hill.”
“When,” says Sir Walter Scott,
“a chieftain designed to cummon his
clan upon any sudden or important
emergency, he slew a goat, and, mak
ing a cross of any light wood, seared
its extremities in the fire, and en
tinguished them in the blood of the
animal. This vas called the Fiery
Cross; also Crean Taisgh, or the
Cross of Shame, because disobedience
to what the symbol implied inferred
infamy. It was delivered to a swift
and trusty messenger, who ran full
speed with it to the next hamlet,
where he presented it to the princi
pal person with a single word, im
plying the place of rendezvous. He
who received the symbol was bound
to send it forward with equal dis
patch to the next village; and thus
it passed with* incredible celerity
through all th? district which owed
allegiance to the chief, and also
among his allies and neighbors if
the danger was common to them. At
sight of the Fiery Cross every man
from sixteen years old to sixty, cap
able of bearing arms, was obliged in
stantly to repair in his best arms and
accoutrements to the place of ren
dezvous. We who failed to appear
suffered the extremities of fire and
sword, which werr- emblematically de
nounced to the disobedient by the
bloody and burned marks upon this
warlike signal.” As a remarkable
instance of the rapidity with which
this system of telegraphy—once com
mon to the Scandinavian, as well as
the Celtic, nation —was earned out,
Scott adds that during the Civil War
of 1745-46, when the Fiery Cross of
ten made its circuit, it upon one oc
casion passed through the whole dis
trict of Bradalbane, a tract of thirty
two miles, in three hours.
“THE BATTLESHIP GEORGIA.”
On the battleship “Georgia” there
is a silver service presented by the
people of this state which was made
possible by the indefatigable work of
Miss Louise Dußose, of this city. For
months this young lady wrote letters
and organized a campaign of educa
tion on the line of patriotism on the
part of our people to donate a sum
sufficient for the purchase of a silver
service which would be in keeping
with the occasion, and at the same
time a credit to the state for which
the battleship was named. The
amount, ten thousand dollars, was
subscribed and the service purchased;
the Service was presented on Georgia
Day at the Jamestown Exposition in
the presence of thousands of Geor
gians and citizens from all sections
of the world. President Roosevelt
was present and participated in the
exercises; army and navy officers,
representing all the foreign countries,
were present; the gift of the service
from the people of Georgia was her
alded from one section of the country
to the otheY by associated news ser
vice; and the many towns and cities
which have their names engraved on
the service are today receiving the
honor and attention of the people of
this country, and in every country
where this ship is anchored, for their
liberality in donating the amount
sufficient for its purchase. After all
the honor, after all the patriotism
shown by our citizens, there are quite
a number of towns and cities which
are enjoying the distinction of having
their names appear on the service
and not one cent of their subscrip
tions has been paid. Is it right for
these places to receive the benefits
without paying their part? We think
not, and feel that when the matter is
brought to their attention through
the press of the state each town and
city which has subscribed will cheer
fully make up the amount which has
been credited to them and forward
a remittance to Miss Dußose, at Ath
ens. Surely Miss Dußose will not be
expected to pay the balance, which is
due the jeweler, $906.25, while the va
rious places which, are due the
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
amounts sufficient to pay in full the
jeweler’s bill sit idly by and do not
make an effort to raise the amount of
the obligations made by their citizens.
The promise-to-pay-notes have been
made; will the people of these towns
repudiate them?
The Atlanta Constitution, comment
ing editorially on the subject, has the
following to say:
“A balance of $906.25 is still due
on the silver service presented by the
people of this state to the battleship
‘Georgia.’ The deficiency is divided
among several towns and cities which
guaranteed Miss Louise Dußose, of
Athens, the sponsor for the move
ment, specified contributions towaid
the total. The names of these towns
and cities are already engraved on
the service, so that wherever the bat
tleship goes they are receiving credit
in common with the communities
which have fully discharged their ob
ligations.
“This is nolf fair to the prompter
towns and cities, to Miss Dußose or
to the firm that supplied the service.
“it is the routine practice in clubs
and other co-operative organizations
to ‘post’ in a conspicuous place the
names of delinquent members, side
by side with the amount involved. The
method generally brings results, since
few men desire that their friends or
the public should know that they have
not met obligations to which they
voluntarily bound themselves.
“The Constitution mentions no
names and it is not the desire of the
sponsor for the ‘Georgia’ fund to
have recourse to the plan of making
public the names of the delinquent
towns, and the amounts unsettled.
“If, however, litigation for the un
paid balance or other development
should be the means of such ex
posure, quite sure that none
of these progressive, well-to-do towns
or cities woqjd relish this form of
advertising.
“They are amply able, by appro
priation or public subscription, to
make up the amount to which they
pledged themselves.
“We are convinced that the towns
and cities, which shall be nameless
for the present, are too commendably
proud of their financial and civic
standing to accept credit before the
world for a patriotic distinction to
which they are not yet entitled.” —
