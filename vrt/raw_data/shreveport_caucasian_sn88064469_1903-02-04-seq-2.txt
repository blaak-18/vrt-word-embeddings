POWERS SO NOTIFIED
The Ten and Twenty Per Cent Divis.
Ion Proposition Is Declared to
Be Absolutely Oflensive to
Modern Civilization.
Washington, Feb. 4.-Herbert W.
Bowen, Venezuela's representative in
the negotiations at Washington for a
settlement of the claims against that
country, has sent through the British
ambassadfor at Washington what
amounts to an ultimatum to the allied
powers of Great Britain, Germany and
Italy, regarding their insistence for
#tierential treatment in the settle
ment of their claims against Venezuela.
This note wad cabled at once to Lon
don, ogppes of it being transmitted to
the Italian and German embassies for
trapse dsion to Rome and Berlin. It
is in reply to the proposal submitted at
a joint conference of the negotiators
by the British ambassador that the
allied powers be allowed two-thirds of
80 per cent of the customs receipts of
the ports of Guayra and Porto Ca
bello, and that the United States and
the other claimant nations, France,
Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Spain and
Norway and Sweden content them
selves with the remaining one-third of
this percentage; that is, 10 per cent of
the receipts of those two posts.
In the note received by the British
ambassador from Mr. Bowen the lat
ter refuses point blank the proposal for
a 20 and 10 per cent division on the
ground to recognise the princiuple it
embodies it would be absolutely offen
safe to modern civilization. In view
of the fact that the negotiators are
agreed on all save the question of
wseusrential treatment, the ambassador
Is Informed that Venezuela has decided
to submit the question to The Hague
tribunal. The acceptance of this pro
pesal, Venezuela contends, carries with
it at raising of the blockade, the gen
oral uadeastanding being that the
bloekade would end when the negotla
tors at Washington had reached an
agreemeat.
It Is understood that in refusing this
last propeesa sulmitted by the British
ambssador on behalf of the allies,
Mr. Bowen takes the ground that he
eannot aecept in principle the conten
tien that blockades and bombard
msats of torts and the consequent kill
ing of helpless men, women and chil
dies eatitles aNy power or alliance of
powers to preferential treatment at the
bands of a civililed nation.

glowing tribute to the Boers, extend
ing to such of them as wished to
