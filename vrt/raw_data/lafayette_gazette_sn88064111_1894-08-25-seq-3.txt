Cherokee on a Trip.
AnrTA SpaiNGS, LA., Aug. so, t894.
"dhtot Lafayette Gazette:
In our last week's correspondence,
we made some mention about a
sojourn of a few weeks at Cheniere
a-la-Croix, on the GulfCost. That
trip was a failure, as by our present
address you can see for yourself.
Friday morning the =7 instant
Cherokee boarded the Southern
Pacific at Lafayette, reaching New A
Orleans the same day at so:3o a. m.
After enjoying the sights of the
Cresent City for two days, we
drifted our sails for parts where
pure air and country quietness could
be had.. At the suggestion of Dr.
Marrero, one of our good New Or
leans friends, we boarded the East
Louisiana Railroad Sunday and
making as our destination, Abita
Springs. This beautiful health re
sort is situated in the interior of the I
pine forests of St. Tammany parish.
The town is a quiet peaceful littlie
country village, richly abounding
with sulphur and mineral springs.
The main spring, near the railroad
depot is considered one of the
finest in the South. The water
was analysed by chemists and found
to contain lime, iron, magnesia,
potassium and soda in immense P
quantities. There is no question
of doubt that this little pine forest
resort, is one of the healthiest in
Louisiana. The town consists of
four hotels, livery stables, stores,
and with a population varying from
4oo to 5oo residents. The hotel
where "ye scribe" is stopping has
had for the past four months from
forty to sixty daily borders, ladies
and gentlemen coming from all
parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and
Texas. Still, with all the advan
tages, that this section possesses,
one cannot compare this parish to
our rich cotton, cane and sugar
farms of South West Louisiana,
(especially Lafayette parish.) It
is but natural that we should find
such a difference, as who does not T
prefer "Home Sweet Home" to
any other place, no matter how rich
and fertile the land may be? Well,
Gazette, old friend, we hope you
are holding your own, as we are
k'eeping down ours.
Best wishes from
CHEROKEE.
The Income Tax.
Atlanta Constitution.
Some people are under the impression
that the new income tax is retroa:tive.
This is a mistake. The income tax
clause of the tariff bill states that from and
after January 1, 1895, until January t, 9goo,
there shall be assessed, levied, collected
and paid annually a tax of 2 per cent on the s
amount of Income over $4,ooo, and that
t this tax shall be assessed by the commissioner
of internal revenue and collected and paid
upon the gains, profits and income for the
year ending December 31st, next preceding
the time of levying, collecting and paying
such tax. The law cannot go into effect
a until January t, x895, und no income tax
will be paid until December 3x, 1895.
This is the status of the tax and it is in no
sense retroactive. People with big incomes
will not have to pay the new tax for nearly
a year anti a half. In that time they will
grow accustomed to the idea, and will recog
nize the justice and equity of the tax.
A paper in the August Areaur which must
attract great attention deals with Keely's
navigation, and is written by Clara B. Moore.
It is a review of Keelv's wonderful experi
ments and discoveries in the construction of
his system of sympathetic physics, a system
'e that is adverse to all the canons of mechan.cal
physics, and which opens up a new world of
force to the studen* of physical science.
n Keeley's researches have lain beyond the
horizon of molecular physics; in the open
field of elemental force, where gravity,
- cohesion, inertia and momentum are disturbed
in their haunts and diverted to use; where,
2 from unity of origin emanates infinite energy
in diversified forms. After years of experi
ment and research Keely had dtscovered
:e that the subtle of etheric vapor, which had
)f eluded his every effort to confine within
walls of metal, and baffled his every attempt
a to control, is the medium of nature's most
a powerful agent, the triune polar flow, and
which he has now harnessed for navigating
the air.
