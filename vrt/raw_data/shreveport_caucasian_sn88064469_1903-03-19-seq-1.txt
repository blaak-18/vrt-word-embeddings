ANNUAL REUNION IN NE \ OR
LEANS IN MAY.
Information of. General Interest to the
Boys in Gray-Elaborate Prep
arations to Be Made.
New Orleans, March 14.-New Or
leans has determined that the Annual
Reunion of the United Confederate Vet
erans, which will take place in the Cres
cent City May 19, 20, 21 and 22 shall be
the most momentous gathering of the
"old soldier boys" held during the past
decade.
Representing, as it does, possibly the
most attractive point in the great South,
it is consequently dear to the hearts of
the men who fought and bled during
those trying times forty odd years ago.
The Southern metropolis stands for,
possibly, the greatest aggregate import
ance, financially and socially in a won
derfully prosperous South. It witnessed
its homes depleted of thousands of brave
souls who left their families and their
belongings to take up arms in a cause
for which they were ready to sacrifice
everything most dear. Thousands went;
thousands remained away; and, the ones
who returned to take up the burdens
they had dropped at the first call, and
who have survived the vicissitudes of
fortune and of fate during the long in
terim, stand with open arms ready to
welcome to their homes and to their I
lasting affections their brothers who had
stood "on the line" amid the storm and
fury which marked the awful battles of I
the civil war.
Because of these memories, and be
cause of the associations which began l
near a half century since and which C
have been kept alive by the fires of a pa
triotic sentiment, the old soldiers of the T
Crescent City are determined to make I
the welco'me they will accord their one I
time companions the warmest on re- c
cord. And in this they will be supportbd t
and assisted by every man, woman and a
child in the city of New Orleans, all of r
~o il nm p h day a~
tR they can isonber' the entire host of
old Confederate Veterans as their loved c
and honored guests. 11
The material side of the reception to l1
the United Confederate Veterans is rap- ti
idly assuming a definite and tangible b
form. Realizing the importance of mak- h
ing the reunion a red letter occasion in c
the annals of these survivors of the 1
Confederacy, New Orleans has deter- ni
mined to raise a fund of $boooon which
will be expanded in providing adequate p
entertainment, both of body and of n
mind, during the several days of the 'ti
convention.
A large number of committees have g
been appointed under the supervision b
and direction of the Confederate camps p
in New Okileans and of Louisiana, and h
these committees are hard at work en
deavoring to perfect the details of the ih
reunion.
In an interview with Colonel J. A.
Harral, aide-de-camp on the staff of
General John B. Gordon and chairman
of the press committee, a committee
composed of the newspaper men of the
city, it was demonstrated that the en
tire situation has been garefully consid
ered and that the local forces are mov
ing quietly yet rapidly in an aggregate
effort to the. end that nothing may be
found 'wanting when the dawn of the
reunion heralds the arrival of the old
gray-clad heroes.
From Colonel Harral it is learned
that the railroads centering in New Or
leans are making every arrangement
necessary for the handling of the mem
bers -of the tco `camps which comprise
the entire organization of the Veterans.
The rates will be made low enough to
prove an incentive to even the most
humble of the old "Vets," who will find
this feature no impediment in his de
sire to reach ihe convention.
The committee on accommodations
have- arranged for a system of room
listing which, in addition to the accom
modation provided by .the hotels, will
eatable the visitors to be taken care of
without the annoying waits so frequent
on occasions of the kind under consid
At leat -ten thousand rooms will be
registered with the several "information
usas?' provided for the purpose, and
the committee hias definite assurance
that 'the rates for board and lodging
will very reasonable.
Arrangements have been made,
throegh the kind.ess of the United
S ates rmemt offcials, for a large
number of army tents which will be

will make the "Canvas City" one of thi
most desirable features of the reunion
There tents will be provided with al
the comforts oecessary. and, in additior
to this, the same location viiil be marked
Ix the erection of an immense dining
hall and series of kitchens where meals
sit be provided. for the attendants on
he convention, at low prices.
Plans have hben prepared for the
convention auditorium which will be
erected at the fair grounds, and work
upon this building will be begun with
ing the next ten days.
The auditorium will be of sufficient
I size to accommodate the estimated num
her of Veterans, and the conveniences
will be so arranged as to enable those
present to keep closely in touch with the
speakers and the proceedings.
Elaborate plans have been made for
the entertainment of the Veterans. and,
in addition to competitive drills and
military parades in which a number of
companies from other states will par
ticipate, a grand ball will be given dur
ing the convention.
The committee on reception will pro
vide a simple method of registration,
showing name, company and residence,
which will be open to the public. It is
desired that every attendant upon the
convention take advantage of this fact
in order to simplify matters for the
various committees having their comfort
at interest.
Bureaus of information will be estab
lished both in the city and at the fair
grounds, by means of which the thous
ands of visitors will be enabled to se
cure information, no matter upon what
subject.
There will also be established at the
fair grounds a sub-mailing station or
postoffice at which mail may be posted,
stamps purchased and mail distributed.
This sub-station will be under the su
pervision of the United States .postal
authorities, and, with an adequate force
of expert mail men, will undoubtedly
be a very attractive feature of the gath
ering.
The committee on hotels and accom
modations wil `shortly prepare a circu
lar letter ti. addresseds to each of the
1500 United derate Veteran camps
of the tUit States, soliciting informa
tion whiph $pay enable the committee,
as soon *s psibe, to determine the ap
proxiM_ of o>ld solites whol
wsIl f lea 'euni
This will undoubtedly lessen the work
of the committee, and work to the bene
fit of the visitors. It is expected that a
large number of newspaper men from
the newspapers of the United States will
be present during the reunion, and it is
hoped that the local papers and the
country press of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Texas and other states of the South
may find it convenient to attend.
In order to facilitate the work of the
press, especial arrangements will be
made for their convenience and enter
tainment.
The rooms of the New Orleans Pro
gressive Union, 311 Baronne street, will
be made permanent headquarters of the
press committee and of the press at
large.
Owing to its location and the conven
iences which the rooms of the Progres
sive Union offer, there is little doubt
but that the location will be one of
great interest to the visiting newspaper
men and will greatly facilitate their
work.
A special reception to the members
of the press will be given in the rooms
of the Progressive Union during one
day of the convention. , Through the
kindness'of the New Orleans Railway
Company, cars have been secured for a

All visiting newspaper men are urged
1 to register at the rooms of the Pro
gressive Union immediately upon arrival
in the city in order that adequate ar
ran ements may be made for their en
tertainment and well-being.
The St. Charles hotel has been deter
mined upon as the location of the gen
: eral United Confederate Veterans head
quarters, and the various sponsors of
the visiting camps will be domiciled here
also.
The Confederate Southern Memorial
Association will hold its fourth annual
convention at New. Orleans on same
date as the United Confederate Veter
ans. The opening feature will he the
I usual Jefferson Davis memorial service.
which will be held at Christ Church
cathedral on Tuesday, May 19, at to
a.m. The commander-in-chief, depart
ment and state commanders, with their
respective staffs, and Confederate Vet
erans in general, are cordially invited to
assist at this solemn and impressive cer
emony, in memory of the first and only
president of the Southern Confederacy.
The tremendous enthusiasm of the
people of New Orleans in regard to this
coming reunion makes it beyond perad
venture that the occasion will be most
delightful from all points of view, and
the municipal authorities, acting as a
unit with the citizens generally, will
pave the way for a delightful series of
pleasant recollections and firmly fix the
claims of New Orleans and its people
upon the good graces and loyal senti
ment of the old boys in gray.

THE GROUND HOG.
AS FORECASTED IT TURNED UP
ON MARCH 14.
It Was Pesky and Pitched About Con
siderably-The Weather Was
Not to Its Notions.
It isn't everybody who can or would
keep up with the ground hog, whose
mnovenieats and speetdatints beyond
the reasonable computation of an ordi
nary man. This is one animal that can
get away completely with a man. It is
conceded that a man may get a coon any
where on a night's hunt, and he can
shoot a deer or a bear or a tiger, but he
must be "a slick one to tree a ground
hog, although there are some women
who could do it if they ventured on such
a trial. As before declared a ground hog
is much smaller than an elephant and
not as ferocious in appearance as a rhi
nocerous, but what it lacks in size and
respectable gentility it can make up on
his past weather record. To some people
the ground hog is everything; to others
it isn't worth a continental, simply be
cause, as other things and signs, it isn't
reliable. Any Jay knows that all signs
fail during a drouth or a long rainy
spell. Insofar as we are concerned, we
wouldn't wager a copper cent on the
ground hog, any more than we would
risk a plant of 'taters or corn in the
moon, as in our humble opinion and in
view of our past efperience "all sich"
should go into the ground. But there are
two great ground hog days in every
year. The first is on the 2nd of Febru
ary and the second is forty days there
after. In ouv last issues of Sunday and
the Weekly we dwelt on the first appear

ance of the ground hog. The weather
was not to its notion and it crawled
back and pulled in the hole. We made
it plain why the rain has followed the
crawling in of the ground hog on Feb
ruary 2, but on March 14 was the time
fixed to let up, for a clearing of the
weather. We watched the hog from day
light but the darn thing didn't show up
until Ii :55 p.m. It surged about, yanked
around, monkeyed a little with a bit of
straw nearby, switched its tail, blinked
its eyes from which came teardrops as
big as your fist. It was disappointed. It
was feeling sorry. It was embarrassed.
It was like a politician who has been
feeding at the public crib all his life and
was fearufl of losing his job. It was
pesky, pitched and floundered about
considerably, but it stuck out, although
it crawled back several times into its
hole and crawled out again. According
to the rule, it's up to the ground hog,
and if the weather be not serene and
lovely, why, put it on the hog or on any
thing, but our private opinion publicly
expressed is that in time there will come
a change regardless of the hog. Now
that the hog is out, it is root or die, and'
the hog will root.
