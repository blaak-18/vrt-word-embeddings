WHAT “WE MISSIONARIES” CON
CEALED.
The Gateway publishes the follow
ing, which is taken from Tom Wat
son’s Weekly Jeffersonian, first, that
the startling “confession” of the
Reverend Mr. Wakefield might, per
haps, be read by some who do not
read Mr. Watson’s publications. And
second, to assist in turning the light
in upon the “system” of “Christian
izing” these slant-eyed murderers.
Because of his position (and he
stays within the lids of the Bible) on
the system being used by foreign
missionaries to “convert” the black
and brown of other countries, Tom
Watson has been fearfully abused
and slandered by some of those who
have, perhaps, been getting some of
the rake-offs from the cash begged
from the poor and needy of this coun
try to educate, clothe, feed, house
and physic these Chinamen, but he
has kept hammering along on the
question until he has put thousands
of people to thinking seriously. Plug
hat preachers have taken issue with
him since he has commenced telling
the country of the system practiced
in squeezing every penny possible out
of the poor, and with their own sta
tistics he has spiked their guns.—

THE ALDRICH TARIFF OUTRAGE.
The Aldrich tariff bill has passed
the Senate in all substantial particu
lars just as the Senator from Rhode
Island dictated it. In substantially
the same form it will become a law.
It will stand as the crowning infamy
of its sponsor and it will hang as the
“old man of the sea” upon the neck
of the political party responsible for
its enactment.
♦ ♦ ♦
It was framed in secret conference
with the representatives of special
interests.
It was framed in the dark and in
willful ignorance of facts which, by
the platform pledges of the Republi
can party, were bound to control in
the framing of this legislation.
* * *
All efforts to harmonize its sched
ules with any recognized principle
of tariff legislation are hopeless,
for it is not based upon principle but
upon greed and graft and “pull.”
Its passage in the Senate was pro
moted by cheap trickery, jobbery,
chicane and manipulation.
* * ♦
Time and again the vote was de
manded and paragraphs jammed
through without explanation, with
out opportunity for Senators to in
vestigate their effect and even with
out a chance for Senators in the
A Weekly Paper Edited by THOS. E. WATSON and J. D. WATSON
Chamber to inform themselves upon
the vote.

There is hardly a powerful special
interest or great trust combination
in the country that is not made its
special beneficiary.

THAT SENATORIAL MERGER
[—New York American
the House, it makes dutiable to the
benefit and upbuilding of the steel
trust.
It protects the smelter trust by a
differential duty on pig lead over and
above the duty on lead in ore which
exceeds the cost of smelting.
It perpetuates excessive duties for
the benefit of a few cutlery manufac
turers in New York and New Eng
land.
* * *
It maintains exaggerated duties on
sewing machines, typewriters, ma
chine tools, and similar mechanical
appliances Qf TFhich the American
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, August 12, 1909
manufacturer dominates the markets
of the entire world and which he sells
abroad for a fraction of the price at
which he sells to the consumer in this
country.
♦ * #
It perpetuates the “Dutch Stan
dard” graft of the criminal sur
.-<5
. . r* v-
trust, which secures to the trust a
practical monopoly of refining with
the power to levy toll on all the cane
sugar consumed by the American
people. ♦ * ♦
It enacts enormous increases in
the duties on cotton goods and taxes
every household in the land for the
benefit of a clique of cotton manu
facturers who are active in “big
business” and influential in Republi
can politics in Rhode Island and
some other New England States.

It “protects” the woolen trust by
the imposition of duties of 100, 120
and up to 150 per cent.,- —duties
which clothing manufacturers say
will increase the cost of clothing one
fourth, —including a so-called “com
pensatory duty” which is a fraud
upon the wool farmer and the public
e' * * *
.t restores the duty on hides,
which the House had repealed, and
thereby gives strength and encour
agement to the beef trust for the
continuation of its unlawful depreda
tions upon the industrial liberties
and independence of the people and
upon the rights of honest business.
* * ♦
It increases the duties on high
grade electric light carbons—a com
modity of universal use—for the
benefit of a self-confessed and abso
lute monopoly.
It is accessory to the extortion of
the lumber trust by continuing the
duty on rough lumber with differen
tial duties added for finished lum
ber that exceed the mill cost of fin
ishing.
* * *
It is a slap in the face of the over
whelming public demand for tariff
revision downward.
* * *
It re-enacts the duties of the Ding
ley law applying to 75 per cent, of
the total of dutiable imports and in
creases the duties on more than half
of the balance. The increases are
of great importance to the consumer
while most of the decreases, like
those on sugar and iron and steel,
are of no value to him for they leave
the duties still prohibitive of any for
eign importation as a regulator of
domestic prices fixed by monopoly.
The reductions, for most part, repre
sent merely the lopping off of a little
of the excessive duty that the trust
doesn’t really need. They mean no
reduction of prices to the consumer.
It rejects the inheritance tax pro
vision proposed by the House to take
for the support of the government at
the rich man’s death a part of the
great fortune which he has piled up
partly by evading just taxes during
his life.
It inaugurates a program designed
to prevent for all time a federal tax
upon the incomes of the wealthy.
♦ ♦ ♦
It provides for the establishment
of a new court of customs appeals
which is expected to increase tariff
duties by judicial construction and
incidentally to add more than SIOO,-
000 a year in salaries to the “fat
jobs” in the customs service.

It is a Repudiation of Party
Pledges and a Violation of Public
Trust. —La Follette’s.
