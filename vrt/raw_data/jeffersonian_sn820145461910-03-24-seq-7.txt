and I want to be the first to thank
you for writing it. (If the Advo
cate-Index-Go Forward and Bros.
Ellis-Broughton and Upshaw would
arraign the barroom more and quit
their everlasting howls for Foreign
Mission money, there w'ould certain
ly be more stars in their crowns.)
And it certainly arouses a spirit
of resentment within me for a North
ern man to come within our State
and say that he owes it to the wo
men of our State to nail the slander
that he accuses you of originating.
Shame on the men of Georgia for
listening to such when they know it
to be untrue!
My desire is, unless it is to offer
an apology to the men of Georgia for
his insult by denouncing our noble
Georgian, that Ellis will not come
South again.
Very truly,

GETTING TIRED OF ELLIS.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l, for one, am
tired of Ellis’s comilf£ South and
villifying, maligning, and misrepre
senting a fellow Georgian. I have
nothing against him on account of
the section from which he comes or
for his having views different from
those of Mr. Watson, but I am op
posed to his flings at, belittlings, and
sluring of a man of my native State,
and here at home at that. Even if
his assertions were true it would not
become him to say so.
And what does he claim? That
he (Watson) is not a scholar, that
he is not a gentleman, that he is
ignorant to an “oceanic” degree, and
that, while he did not call him a
liar, he will prove that he is. Did
he prove it? If he did, the home
papers which try to down Watson,
the Georgian, and uphold Ellis, fail
ed to give the proof.
Even if Watson’s ignorance is
“oceanic”, (that’s the broadest term
that could possibly be used), and no
gentleman, what on earth has that
got to do with the subject of mis
sions? The critic in our debating
society used to criticise us harshly
for leaving the subject, and I fail to
see how Ellis could get farther from
his. But Ellis must come down and
try to belittle Watson in his own
State because no one else will. No!
His record proves him to be a Chris
tian gentleman. And, Mr. Ellis, as
to that “oceanic” ignorance, you’ll
have to show me. I’m from Mis
souri.
“The Song of the Bar-room”, “In
fluence of Long Service in Con
gress”, “Vardaman for the Senate”,
three short articles in this week’s
Jeff., without considering the
“oceanic” amount of historical work
and constructive legislation which he
has done, will prove to any clear
minded, level-headed person who is
liberal enough to see and acknwledge
facts that Thos. E. Watson is one of
the most learned men this country
has ever produced.
By telling his many and intensely
interested readers how he has train
ed himself so as to do such an im
mense amount of work, Mr. Watson
will greatly aid and please many an
aspiring and ambitious youth who
desires to be able to turn out more
work.
May you live always and double
your subscription list and influence
each year.

RIGHT HERE IN GEORGIA.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I read your
paper. You say you are opposed to
so much missionary money, and the
white ladies slaving for the negro.
I am opposed to it, too. It is just
awful to go in the country and see
the poor white ladies and children
working like slaves, and the white
men giving their money to those
black sluts that walk up and down
the roads and grin at the white la
dies and children that have to work,
and make their brags that they don’t
have to work, they have a white man
to back them up. If Georgia has
any law I think it had better be used
to protect the poor white ladies. If
there isn’t some move made to stop
those mulatoes we will all be re
lated to the negro. I think that
every negro that has a white child
ought to be made to swear the child,
and the father and mother both
hung. J think the white ladies and
poor little children would have more
to eat and more to wear.
P. S.—Advise what move to make
and what you would do if you had
the power. I hope to see your an
swer in The Jeffersonian.

THE CHRISTIAN INDEX WON’T
TREAT ANY ONE FAIRLY.
Dear Sir: —I have just read your
reply to Mr. Ellis, as published in
the Constitution. As predicted, you
have completely floundered him.
Turn your guns on Broughton and
make him produce those letters. If
Broughton fails to give them to the
public, the Baptists of Georgia ought
to denounce him as a traitor to oui’
denomination. Broughton and the
Tabernacle influence have deceived
the Baptist long enough.
Wake up, Georgia Baptist, and
down with Broughtonism!
Enclosed find subscription price
for one new subscriber.
Knowing you to be a busy man, I
send you some clippings.
I want to say that I have been
slow to agree with you. After study
ing your position carefully, I find
you are on safe grounds.
I have formulated the following
premise. If any of your many read
ers disagree with me I hope you will
give us some space in the Jeffs to
discuss, to wit: «
No organization, save a New Tes
tament church, has any scriptural
authority to teach and preach the
gospel as a means of evangelizing
the world.
The Christian Index has refused
to allow me a hearing on this propo
sition.

ELLIS HARMING RELIGION BY
HIS FOUL TONGUE.
Dear Mr. Watson:—l have been
intending to write you ever since the
recent eruption of W. T. Ellis, the
Northern bigot, who thinks he is do
ing missionary work when he comes
South to tell our people that they do
not know anything about the inter
pretation of the scriptures because
they have not travelled as he and his
people have, and for that reason he
condescends to come down into the
jungles of Georgia and in the very
shadow of the Capitol, and in a
building professedly dedicated to the
Christian religion, and before our own
people, many of whom no doubt be
lieve themselves to be Christians,
he poured out the most disgusting
stream of self-laudation, filth, vitu
peration and indecency that has ever
been heard in a civilized or even
semi-civilized community; but owing
to the fact that I have been suffering
with a case of lagrippe ever since I
have not had the strength to write.
I only regret that Ellis’ “Lay Ser
mon on Missions” was not reported
in full, as no one could undertake
to quote with exactness, by memory,
this hour and a quarter of Yankee
spleen. But to those who heard it,
there must come a sobre after
thought, which will recall with dis
gust the putrid vomit of this mis
sionary evangel.
I confess to being one of the au
ditors on this occasion, and remain
ed in silence and disgust through it
all. But I was not the only one so
affected. From the demonstrations,
I would say that far the greater por
tion of that large audience was
heartily ashamed that a house of
worship should be the scene of such
a performance.
It is true, there were a few scat
tered about the rostrum, and per
haps in the audience, who, from their
noisy laughter at the most unchris
tian and untruthful parts of the so
called address, called to mind that
passage of the scripture found in
Acts 19: 24-28.
If Ellis is the best exemplar of the
Jeffersonian
Christian missionary the North can
send us, even though he has “travel
ed around the world in many boats,
trains and other vehicles”, it is
earnestly to be hoped that we may
be left for some time yet to grope in
our native ignorance and perverse
ness of heart.
The stuff with which Ellis befoul
ed the ears of his auditors can not
hurt you, but has done great harm
to the cause of religion, as the
speaker was supposed to be endorsed
by the Christian men and women
present, and by the ministers pres
ent in attendance on the “Bible Con
ference”, many of whom could not
and would not countenance such a
spirit.
With most cordial personal re
gards,
Your friend,

CHRIST NEVER WROTE ANY
LETTERS.
Dear Sir:—lnclosed you will find
a clipping from Duckworth’s paper,
a weird and mysterious letter pur
porting to have been found at the
foot of the Cross written by Christ
Himself. Please read and let us
hear through the weekly Jeffersonian
what you think about it.

More than two columns of Duck’s
paper are taken up with idiotic
drivel about that alleged “Letter”,
found under the alleged stone on
Calvary. Duckworth ought to be
ashamed of himself. T. E. W.
A METHODIST READY TO DE
FEND MR. WATSON.
Dear Sir:—l have just finished
reading your reply to the man Ellis,
of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pub
lished in the Constitution of today,
and I write to say that I indorse the
same in full. I will also state that
I am a member of the M. E. Church,
South, in good standing. I will take
pleasure in defending your position
at all times and under all circum
stances. Yours very truly,
W. M. ALEXANDER.

SHORT AND SWEET.
Amen, Mr. Watson. You skinned
’em to my liking.
Respectfully,

FROM “BLEEDING KANSAS”.
Dear Sir:—l am a farmer, more
than sixty years of age: fifty of them
I have lived on the prairies of Kan
sas, and for the past thirty-two years
have been a Greenbacker and Popu
list. So you see that I am neither
a spring chicken nor a tenderfoot. I
have tried to keep posted on the af
fairs of our country since 1878, and
it does seem to me that we now have
the most deplorable conditions that
ever existed in this so-called free
land.
To me there appears far more
prospect of a revolution than of any
reform.
The anarchistical trusts and pi
ratical crew at Washington, \vho are
now running things, have pulled
down the old flag of our forefathers
‘_jJTom Mfafsofi Tobacco**

and run up to the masthead of the
Ship of State the black flag, with
the skull and crossbones on it, and
loudly proclaim, “Your money or
your life,” —and they are getting
both.
Our mis-representatives in Con
gress seem to have but one mission
in life: to rob the people, uphold the
plundering trusts and feather their
own nests.
If our present Congressmen, who
voted for the infamous tariff bill,
had their ears close to the grass
roots, they would hear the rumbling
of a coming cyclone in the elections
this fall, that will sweep them back
to private life again.
You are the only man who, as a
member of Congress, has given the
farmers any practical help, in giv
ing them the Rural Free Delivery
of mail, and I voted for you when a
candidate for Vice-President.
The Socialists are a set of vision
ary dreamers, with a proposed rem
edy worse than the disease, and im
practical in its workings.
My impression is that the people
will have to be soaked some more
before they get their eyes opened,
and I fully believe they will get it
good and plenty before very long,
judging from the present condition
of things.
I am also very sure that things in
this country will not always con
tinue as they are.
We may not live to see the good
time coming for this old earth, but
it is on its way when every oae shall
have equal rights and justice.
I am a firm believer in the good
old Scriptural doctrine that
‘‘The few shall not forever sway,
The many toil in sorrow.
The gates of hell are strong today,
But Christ shall reign tomorrow.”
