VEGETABLE SICILIAN
HAIR
Every year increases the populari
ty of this valuable Hair Preparation;
which is due to merit alone. We
can assure our old patrons that it is
kept fully up to its high standard;
and it is the only reliable and perfect
ed preparation for restoring GRAY
OR FADED HAIR to its youthMfil color,
making it soft, lustrous, and silken.
The scalp, by its use, becomes white
and clean. It removes all eruptions
and dandruff, and, by its tonic prop
erties, prevents the hair from thllinug
out, as it stimulates and nourishes
the hair-glands. By its use, the hair
grows thicker and s'tronger.rs In
baldness, it restores the capillary
glands to their normal vigor, and
will create a new growth, except in
extreme old age. It is the most eco
nomical HAIm DRESSING ever used,
as it requires fewer applications,
and gives the hair a splendid, glossy
appearance. A. A. Hayes, M.D.,
State Assayer ofMassachusetts, says,
"The constituents are pure, and care
fiully selected for excellent quality;
and I consider it the BnSTR,'P ,EPA
IATION for its intended purposes."

FOR THE WHISKERS.
As our Renewer in many cases
requires too long a time, and too
much care, to restore gray or fitded
Whiskers, we have prepared this
dye, in one preparation; which will
quickly and effectually accomplish
this result. It is easily applied,
and produces a color which will
neither rub nor wash off. Sold by
all Druggists. Price Fifty Cents.

Cherry Pectoral,
For Diseases of the Throst and Lungs,
such as Coughs, Colds, Whooping
Cough, Bronchitis, Asthma,
and Consumption.
Among the great
discoverres of mInod
ern science, few are
of more real value
to mankind than
this etffectual rein
edv for all diseases
of the Throat and
Lungs. A vast tri
al of its virtues,
throughout this andt
other countries, has
shown that it does
surely and effectually control them. The tes
timony of our best citizens, of all classes, es
tablishes the fact, that CIII.RItY Pl'.crolA.\l.
will and ,does relieve and cure the afllicting
disorders of the Throatnd Lungs beyond any
other medicine. The most dangerous affec
tions of the Pulmonary Organs yield to its
power; and cases of Consuamption, cured
by this preparation are pnblicly known, so
remarkable as hardly to be believed, were
they not proven beyond dispute. As a rem
edy it Is adequate, on which the public may
rely for full protection. By curing Coughs,
the forerunners of more serious disease, it
saves munnumbered lives, and an amount of
smuffering not to hIe computed. It challenges
trial, and convinces tihe most sceptical.
Every family should keep it on lhand as a
protection naainst the ertly uand unperceived
attacks of Pulmonary Affections, which are
easilv met at first; but which become incura
ble, aind too often fatal, if nealected. Tender
lungs need this dcfence; anif it is nnwiso to
be without it. As a safeguard to children,
amid the distressing diseases which beset the
Throat and Chest of childhood, £I1Er.RY
-Pv.cronAr. is invaluable; for, by its timely
use, multitudes are rescued from premature
graves, and saved to the love and affection
centred on them. It acts speedily and surely
against ordinary colds, securing sound nand
health-restoring sleep. No one will suffer
troublesome Induenuza and painful Bron.
chtle, when they know how easily they can
be cured.
Originally the produnct of long, laborious,
and successful chemical investigation, no cost
or toil is spared in making every bottle in the
utmost possible perfection. It may be confi
dently relied upon as possessing all the vtr.
tnes it has ever exhibited, and capable of
producing cures as memorable as the greatest
at has ever effeeted.
