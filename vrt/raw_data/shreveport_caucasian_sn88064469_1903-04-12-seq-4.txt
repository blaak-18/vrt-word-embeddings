THE CAUCASIAN.
Official Journal of the

SUNDAY, APRIL 12, 1903.
AN ISSUE IN THE STATE CAMl
PAIGN.
In this issue is reproduced from the
Times-Democrat of April 9 an editorial
headed "Politics in Two States," which
is commended to the careful and earl
est perusal of every reader of the Cau
casian. It is gratifing to note that the
question of nominations by primary
elections is growing and becoming all
powerful, as indicated by the utterances
of the press throughout the State. The
great majority of Democrats who vote
are realizing the effect of the abuses,
of "cut and dried" conventions where
the program of a few is schemed
through, after which the dear, good
people who may not favor such meth
ods or scheming may be -. In the
future, as in the past, the very sugges
tion of the nomination of officials from
governor to constable by primary elec
tions will arouse the wrath of the politi
cal time-servers, the untiring feeders at
the public crib, whose power and in
fluence must rest in and through the
cut and dried convention methods, and
these "faithful," never satisfied and
always hungry feeders will be strongly
arrayed against the primary system.
But if the majority of Democrats who
vote Are in earnest, if tie majority of
Democrats who participate 'in elections
desire a return of the power divested
from them during the era of reconstruc
tion and vested by appointment in the
Governor; if the people favor the rule
of the people, by and for the people,
they will assert their authority in tone
and in force, which -will be most con
vincing. It must -be clear to careful ob
servers that the people of Louisiana
the great majority of Democrats who
vote-are determined on' their emanci
pation from the political machine which
has been manipulated by a few for the
benefit of the select and the "faithful
few," *ho yield gracefully to every
suggestion or scheme of the machine.
The candidate for any office who wilk
hesitate to announce his views and hit
stand on political issues, which concern
the people of his State,. is not worthy
the confidence of the people, and there
fore he should e:xpect no favor or re
cognition from the people-at least
the support of the great majority oft lae
T icrai o vote and 'who insist
that it is Democratic to return all
power to the 1aeople. This is one of the
issues which will enliven the State cam
paign.
HON. JOHN T. MICHEL
A number of public journals con
tinue to assert that Hon. John T.
Michel, the present secretary of State,
will be a candidate for Governor. If he
can get the support of New Orleans,
and hWs friends insist that he will, he
will be a formidable candidate. -If Mr.
Michel is a candidate it is in order for
him to come out in the open and let the
public know just how he stands on the
issues of the day.-Homer Guardian
Journal.
Perhaps Mr. Michel is surveying the
political field with deliberation. Prob
ably he is disinclined to expend his in
tience prematurely and is maintaining
a discreet reserve, realizing the logic of
the old story of the early and the late
birds and the worm. The bird which
was early failed to get the worm which
was late, but the bird which was late got
the Morm which was not early. If Mr.
Michel is a candidate he will doubtless
let the people know if he wilLmake
contest for governor on issues which
concern the people or will favor the
grab-all of all the political soft jobs
which may be handed around, in regu
lar succession, to the favored few. The
great majority of Democrats who vote
will, in time, insist on knowing the po
sition of every candidate besides 'the
ambition of securing the coveted office.
There seems to be more or less dis
position to oppose Judge Blanchard for
Governor for the reason that he is sup
posed to be the candidate of the State
administration, and was virtually slated
for the place by the bosses three years
ago. Many people are inclined to resent
any assumption of that character.
Homer Guardian.
Who has said that Mr. Blanchard is
Murphy J's candidate for Governor?
And is Foster the whole push, the only
pebble on the political beach in Louis
iana?

POLITICS IN TWO STATES.
Times-Democrat April 9:
In Mississippi there is a strong senti
ment in avor of a republican form of
government. The spectacle of candi
dates for Governor and candidates for
the United States Senate meeting to
gether at Winona and taking the peo
ple of the State into their canfidence
was a healthy one, and gives promise
of a popular administration of the af
fairs of the State in days to come.
There is.no question that politicians th*
world over prefer gum shoe methods in
politics, and perhaps these Mississippi
candidates would adopt these methods
by preference if they were permitted to
3o so. But in M1ississippi the people de
mand a part in the politics of the State
and gutm shoe methods are not to the
liking of the voters. They desire to
know, as they have a right to know, the
views an tithe policies of the men who
are asking their franchises that they
may vote intelligently and for men of
their choice. We are told that all of the
candidates for Governor candidly told
the people their views on all the ques
tions now before the State for settle
ment, and that there was no attempt
whatever to evade issues. The principol
issue in the campaign is the distribution
of the State's educational fund, one of
the candidates desiring that each race
shall receive exactly the stum it contri
butes to the fund, while the other there
candidates are in favor of continuing
the ditribution as now, according to the
number of educable children and with
out regard to the sutn contributed by
the separate races. But the importance
of this issue, grave as it is, is over
shadowed by the importance of the fact
that the views of the candidates are
known to the voters, and that they may
register their will as they desire. In
deciding upon a candidate they are not
receiving a pig iin a poke.
Unfortunately we do these things dif
ferently in Louisiana. We have been,
and still are, in the habit of, selecting
public officials by the' gum shoe method
and without any definite idea of what
they stand for. We, too, are to have a
gubernatorial campaign this year, but
the candidates will not come out as
they have done in Mississippi and ap
peal'to the voters on policies and prin
ciples. Very few people, and these
mainly of the class which has axes to
grind; will know what the candidates
staid for. Already several names have
been mentioned for the chief office in
the State. Why have these gentlemen
b+ mentioned for that high office?
Does any one know what they stand for
in State politics? Their policies are not
known. Finally a convention will assem
ble and a name will be presented to the
people of the State for. which they are
expected to vote, because certain bar
gains have been . made, of which the
mass of the people are ignorant, and- in
which they have no part and no interest
except in the payment of the bill.
..Which is the better method, that of
Mississippi or that of Louisiana? There
can be but one answer to that question
among those who have a firmly ground
ed belief in the desirability of republi
can institutions. If the people are to
have any voice in the government of the
State the people must know for whom
they are voting, and not discover after
the election that they have selected a
man whose views. are 'directly oppsed
to their own. The Louisiana method is
eternally wrong and the Mississippi
method is etertially right, if there be
any merit whatever in the republican
form of government. The man who is a
candidate for the suifrages of the peo- I
pie should let the people know precisely I
for what policies and what principles he
stands, and should succeed or fall oh
those policies and principles. To obtain
office furtively is to destroy the admin
istration for good before it is inatugt
rated.
The time will surely come when we
shall adopt the ississippt method, and
the sooner it comes the better it will be
for the State. The gum shoe- should no
longer have a place in American poli
tics, and the man whose methods are
furtive should be kept -in private life.
This method of tht partisan in one por
tion of ti State declaring that a can
didate stonds ,for one thing. while a
partisan i. another section declares that
he standsY for another, the candidate
meanwhile keeping. silent o naIl the pol
icies that are up for settlement before
the peopl is not hoihst politics. The
day is sing everywhere, despite the
efforts o the politicians to keep it
alive, wh - a public man shall demand
the votes- bf the people, even though he
represent iothing save an itching desire
to hold ptjblic office. Will the people of
Louisiana permit it to exist in this
State until it has been abolished every
where else?
"KEE.P UP THE FIGHT."
- In a well tempered, strongly logical
editorial under the caption quoted, the
Homer Guardian-Jo rdal. in- urging the
abrogation of the appointive power of
the Govetorde except in cases of *a
iancies, Wand citing -the success. of the'
people Rhen they ljsisted on the elec
tion of the police jurors,, which were
then appointive by 'the Governor, says:
"It will win bedts it is ighti The
rotntp that al pubac ofers 'should
of pure and undefiled Democracy, and
there can be no doubt of the ultimate
triumph of the doctrine in all forms of
government in which the people have a
voice. To say that the people are in
capable of selecting their own officers
is to impeach their capacity for self
government. while the idea that the peo
ple can not he trusted to elect their as
sessors and parish school boards, but
that these same peopl) can elect a gov
ernor. who can appoint these officers all
over the State. in parishes in which he
is not acquainted, in the recommenda
tion of a few local pooliicians. is ridicu
lous and absurd. If the people can elect
a governor they can also elect their
Ilical officers.
Keep up the fight. The people are
bound to win it. Make it an issue, and
a lively one. in the next State election.
Eklet a Governor andt a Legislature
pledged to accord the people home rule
and local self-government. And see to
it that they are men or. at least, char
acter and stamina erough to keep a
pledge. In our opinion this is by far the
most important matter hefore the people
of Louisiana.'
