T. J. PILCHER, A NOBLE SOUL,
CROSSES THE GREAT DIVIDE.
Resolutions on the Death of Brother
T. J. Pilcher.
Whereas, On June the twenty
eighth last, an allwise Providence
saw fit to remove from our midst
our friend and brother, T. J. Pilcher,
who was an ardent, loyal and enthu
siastic member of Local Union No.
1415, therefore,
Be it resolved by the members of
this local, That while we sincerely
regret the loss of our friend and
brother, his wise counsel, his ar
dent love for, and his loyal and en
thusiastic support of, the principles
of the order, yet we humbly submit
to the rulings of an allwise Provi
dence, trusting that his loyalty to the
Union may prove an incentive for
good to those of us who remain, and
trusting also, that our loss is his
gain.
Resolved further, That we, as a
Union and as a fraternity, extend
our profoundest sympathy to the
widow and sons of our deceased
brother.
Brother T. J. Pilcher, son of Ran
som and Martha Pilcher, was born
May 3, 1848, and was married to
Miss Lettie Francis Crutchfield July
i, 1871, they having reared a family
of five sons, the youngest having
reached manhood. Four of these five
sons have been *members of Local
Union No. 1415.
Brother Pilcher was a member of
the Methodist Episcopal church, and
bore his suffering with Christian for
titude. To those who waited on him
during his last illness he expressed
his perfect resignation to the will of
his Maker and his readiness to meet
Him when he should call.
J. C. KING,
JNO. STEWART,
R. J. PERRY,
Committee.
Ed. Comment: One of the last
things that Mr. Pilcher did before
taking the bed, from which he never
arose, was to write me and tell me
how the Rev. Norton was slandering
me about the Greene county estate.
It is with a deep sense of sympathy
for the family and the friends of
this good citizen and loyal follower
that 1 give space to the resolutions.

A BROTHER EDITOR’S ENDORSE
MENT AND ENCOURAGEMENT.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir:—Allow me to congratu
late you for those articles on Social
ism, which I have been able to read
in some of our State papers,
I enclose check for SI.OO, for which
send me the paper in which you
are publishing these articles.
Yours truly,
A. K. McGILL.
THE AVERAGE PREACHER WON’T
READ AND MISQUOTES.
Dear Sir:—lnclosed find check for
two dollars, for which send The
Jeffersonian to J. A. Florence, Chip
ley, Ga., R. F. D. 5, Box 26. Send
me your Magazine. As we have a
route from Stimson now, be sure to
get Brother John his paper this week.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
I had the pastor to spend the
night with me a few nights ago, and
he takes a different view from most
preachers. He said that he believed
the discussion of foreign missions
would do more good than anything
that could happen—that the people
would give more intelligently. Then
he burst out in a laugh and said
that you had said that one American
child was worth more than all the
negroes and Chinese in heathendom.
Now, I did not dispute with him, but
I don’t think you said exactly that.
You intimated that one American
soul was worth a cowpen full of ne
groes and Chinamen.
Well, allow me to congratulate you
for being so prudent as not to go
off half-cocked —sticking to the
motto, “Be sure you are right”—and
then giving them hail Columbia.
Respectfully, your friend,
H. A. FLORENCE.
Stimson, Ga., Oct. 18, 1909.
Answer.
You were right, and Brothei'
was altogether wrong. You will find
what I said in the Magazine article
in reply to Miss Janet Hay Hous
ton. My statement was that the
sixty thousand white girls who
are being made the victims of
the white slaver, in this country,
every year, are worth more to
the future of this country, and
of humanity, than all the negroes on
the face of the earth. That, of
course, meant the victims of the white
slaver of past years, this year, and
all of the coming years in which the
vile traffic is allowed to prey upon
Caucasian girls.
Taken in that sense, I think that
even Brother would agree with
me, that this enormous number of the
female members of our race are more
important to the future of civiliza
tion than every negro that now lives.

JEFFERSONIAN CLUBS.
The organization of Jeffersonian
Clubs is spreading very rapidly
throughout the State. At Bowman
a club was organized a week or two
ago with a membership of one hun
dred and seven.
This club is composed of represen
tative citizens from every walk in life.
Not only is this movement drawing
recruits from the very best citizen
ship, but from every political party.
If we properly understand the ob
ject of these clubs, they are intended
to promote the principles of govern
ment as taught by Jefferson. It is
strictly a nonpartisan movement.
They will not try to further the in
terest of any one political party, but
will .be independent. At the same
time, they will meet at regular pe
riods for the purpose of discussing
questions of governmental economics.
They will demand from their law
makers of whatever political faith or
creed, laws for the benefit of the
greatest number and will see to it
that only those who are thoroughly
in sympathy with the doctrine of
“Equal rights to all and special privi
les to none,” receive their support.
If this movement grows, as it un
doubtedly will, and they adhere to
their intention of independent ac-
15 b*
tion in all matters political it will
see the passing of party slavery and
party prejudice.—Royston Record.

‘YOU CAN HELP HERE.”

Dear Sir: —I found this petition in
The Jeffersonian at noon Saturday,
and I have secured this list of forty
seven names. No trouble to get sign
ers here.
This is all the paper will hold, and
I will send it in. This is a small
place and thinly settled, but all have
signed that I have presented it to.
If I was in Webster, where I lived
before I came here, I could fill a
large paper, I think. Send me some
blank petitions if you have some,
and I will try and get them in hands
that will use them. There are a
number of people that don’t know
anything of the history of the green
back, or the banking system, but
when it is explained to them, they
are willing to sign. Hope you will be
able to get names by the million, for
I fear that with Taft and his fihance
committee, with that old tool of Wall
Street, Aldrich, as chairman, it will
take a strong fight to keep them from
getting in some diabolical work
against the people’s money. With
best wishes for the success and pres
ervation of our money, I remain,
Yours truly,
S. J. CROW.
Safety Harbor, Fla., Oct. 11, 1909.
To The Weekly Jeffersonian:
Please publish the above as an il
lustration of the good you did by
publishing in your October 7th Jef
fersonian our petition to Congress
to save the silver dollar and the
greenback. Besides Mr. Crow’s let
ter, we got other fine ones from near
ly every Southern State and some
from Eastern and Northern States,
all sending lists of names and
asking for blank petitions, and
all referring to The Jeffer
sonian, and some to the American
Whip. No .mistake, this work is
arousing the interest and attention
of the people, and wherever we can
break through the stupidity, bigotry,
prejudice or national bank dominated
press and get publication and a hear
ing through free papers, we are sure
to receive a grand response. The peo
ple appreciate being told, in advance,
the plans of the robbers, instead of
waiting until after the villainy is
done. Let the people see what is
going on. Then they will help in
prevention if possible. When Con
gress assembles they will write and
warn tfieir members to “Let the sil
ver dollar and the greenback alone,”
and destroy the Aldrich-Taft central
bank scheme. Let there be light.
The Jeffersonian and a number of
friendly papers over the country are
nobly helping in this work. Send
for petition blanks.
Yours truly,
JOS. N. STEPHENS,
Nat’l Sec’ty U. S. Monetary League,

RESULTS OF WORK DAY.
The best result was in the increas
ed activity to save the orphan chil
dren. The second is that every one
was educated to work and not beg
for their absolutely helpless broth-
Children who are educated to
work for the unfortunate will be
sure to do it in after-years.
The result in money at Decatur
has been about SIO,OOO so far and
will, we feel sure, go beyond the
$13,000 received last year by them.
The other homes in Georgia, South
Carolina and other States all have
received splendid gifts, and will
amount in the total for all the homes
to more than the $35,000 received
by them last year. Though these
amounts seem large, they do not be
gin to supply their positive needs.
It was a great, joyous, happy fes
tival to many people, and long to be
remembered.
Dear Bro. Editor: —Please put the
above note in your paper, so the peo
ple may know what has been accom
plished by their efforts.
Thanks for your many kindnesses.
Yours very truly,
H. L. CRUMLEY.

WHAT, THEN, IS THE PLAN?
Much has been suggested as a plan
by which zealous Christians and mis
sionaries may be found in line of
duty—giving the gospel to the “poor
heathens.” But, up to date, all ef
forts have proven a comparative fail
ure. Undoubtedly something must be
out of harmony with the Divine
program, hence the failure. Af
ter a reasonable and thorough
investigation of the subject, I
arrive at this brief synopsis, as
follows: Father Adam sinned
and brought death to the race of man
kind, and all living creatures; hence,
no one had immortality inherently,
then or now, else they could not
have died.
The world has, in all ages, been
dominated by Satan, who has exclud
ed the true light to a great extent.
The world’s inhabitants generally
have never accepted or believed in
the true God, even to this day. Few
it is true, in all the ages, have been
faithful and loyal to their Creator,
God. Now, as all men, good and bad,
have met death, lost their souls, their
life, a resurrection was promised
which affects the Christian, the pagan
and the savage as well; all receive life
again, lost in Adam. Then the world
enters upon the judgment period, or
millennium, of one thousand years
duration, in which the holy prophets,
preachers and present-day devot
ed missionaries become “kings
and priests unto God” and will
go forth in one continuous mis
sionary effort for the uplift of
the world of sin-degraded hu
manity. Satan is to be suppressed
