Our Post-Card Club
By Daddy Jim.
Before awarding the prizes in the
last competition, we want to mention
the good work that is being done by
a little boy, 12 years old, Charlie Ross
Thaxton, of Crawfordville, Ga., who
has sent in several lists of subscri
bers. His last list contained 16
names, most of them for 'a year. We
have not figured out his commission
exactly, but he has probably made
about ten dollars for himself in the
last two or three weeks. Pretty good,
that, for a boy of twelve. Come
along, boys and girls; you -can all earn
money and prizes too, if you will
work for them.
First Prize for Girls.
Maude Womack, age 10, R. F. D.
4, Elberton, Ga. “I am a little coun
try girl, living twelve miles from
town, but we get our mail every day,
for which we thank Mr. Watson. My
papa tells me that he was the author
of the R. F. D. I am in the fourth
grade, and love my teacher.” She
adds, in another letter, that this was
her third trial, and she almost gave
up trying, but her mother told her to
try again. Good mother, and good
little girl. Glad you won this time,
but even if you hadn’t won, you
should never give up trying.
Second Prize for Girls.
Ruth Emory, age 12, Gabbettville,
Ga.: “I thought I would try this
time, and see how well I could do.
Papa takes the Jeffersonian and I like
to read it. I would like to win a
prize, so I am doing my best. I am
twelve years old, and love to go to
school.” This was a very neat, pret
ty letter, and bore every evidence of
pains and care.
First Prize for Boys.
Virgil Glenn, Crest, Ga.: We cel
ebrated Washington’s birthday last
Monday. We take your Weekly Jef
fersonian, and like to read it very
much. I tarn in the fourth grade, and
like my studies. We are going to
stand examination tomorrow. At
play time we grade down our base
ball ground.” Virgil is only twelve
years old, but he writes well; has
something to say, says it, land has a
good firm handwriting.
Second Prize for Boys.
This prize goes all the way to Kan
sas, to Russell Miller, age 10, R. F.
D. 3, Burlingame, Kas.: li Papa’s an
old-time greenbacker. He reads tihe
Jeffersonians. I am ten years old,
and in the fifth grade. The money
power must be put down, if it takes
every patriot in this broad land. I
would like a ‘Watson’ knife. Yours
for the right.”
Another Good Letter.
“My father takes your paper and
magazine. He reads them at every
chance. My mother died when I was
six years old. We have a good ’Chris
tian woman living with us. I love her
as a mother. lam 13 years old. Mi
riam Yeates, Mansfield, Texas.”
Will Help in the Garden.
“Papa takes the Jeffersonian, and
enjoys reading it very much. lam a
little girl, 12 years of age. I go to
school, like my teacher, and am in
the fifth grade. School will be out
soon; then I will help papa and mam
ma in the garden and field. Your lit
tle friend, Gertrude White, Collins
ville, Ala.”
Xsl>e Jeffersonian
Determined.
“I go to Villa Rica High School.
I am in the fifth grade. lam deter
mined to have an education, so I can
teach the little boys and girls when I
am grown. I hope my letter will win
the prize. Your little friend, Reba
Webb, Villa Rica, Ga. ” You write a
very pretty letter, Reba, and if it
were not for one or two little errors
you would have won a prize.
A Nature Lover.
“I am a little girl, 13 years of age,
and like flowers very much. Igo on
the mountain and gather flowers, and
like to sit 'and hear the brook running
over tihe rocks, and like to hear the
birds sing. Marie Barton, Armuehee,
Ga.”
From Panama City.
“I live in a town on the west coast
of Florida. A crowd of us went in a
gasoline launch to the Gulf Beach.
We carried our lunch and spent the
day. We went in bathing, fished, and
got a lot of pretty shells. There was
seventeen in the crowd. Blandford
Dixon, Panama City, Fla.” You
might have won a prize if you had
mentioned your age. Try again.
Swapping Seats.
This is among the best of the many
good boys’ letters, but it was not quite
up to the mark for a prize: “Good
morning, Mr. Watson; here I am
again. I cut wood and swap seats in
school. I like to see all people pros
perous and happy, but before this can
be, you’ll have to swap seats with the
President. So come on, Mr. Watson,
for March, 1912. Fred Thomas
Bridges, Gainesville, Ga.” He adds:
“I am a boy and glad of it. I am
12 years old.”
From Mississippi.
“Papa takes the Jeffersonian, and
I like to read the letters. I go to
school, and when it rains very hard
I wade through water over my shoe
lops. I am twelve years old, and
have light hair and blue eyes. My
name is Frank Joyner, Montpelier,
Miss.”

that are worth printing, but for which
we have had no room. Write to us
about anything that comes into your
mind, and don’t forget that we want
new subscribers to the paper. Many

that you get your money. If you

We want a bright, active boy or girl
in every county and town in the Uni
ted States.
