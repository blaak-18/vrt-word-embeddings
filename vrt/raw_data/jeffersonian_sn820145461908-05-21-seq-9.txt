Gubernatorial Campaign .Notes.
The Augusta Herald has published
an editorial on the “reasons why the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad is sup
porting Joe Brown/’
Now, then, let some Joe Brown editor
give us a “piece” on the “reasons why
the Southern Railroad is supporting Hoke
Smith.”
Was it James R. Gray’s Atlanta Jour
nal which had so much to say about
Joe Brown’s management, as Executor,
of his father’s estate?
Alas! We are now hearing considera
ble about some one’s management, as
Executor, of a father-in-law’s estate; and
we can’t help thinking of the old adage
about glass houses and stone throwing.
If Joe Brown was a cruel man he
could make some extremely disagreea
ble retorts on his assailant.
How can the success of either candi
date influence the Disfranchisement law?
Could either Smith or Brown turn
white men against it, if those white men
are in favor of it?
If so, how?
Where are the white voters who can
be turned against disfranchisement by
Hoke Smith or Joe Brown?
They do not exist.
As to the negroes, have they not been
opposed to the measure all along?
How can either Smith or Brown in
crease the hostility of the black man to
the law which takes away his ballot?
Obviously, neither can do it. Then,
what can either Smith or Brown do, after
June 4th, to increase the negro vote
against disfranchisement ?
Think calmly, and answer.
Will Smith help to pay the back taxes
of the negroes, so that they can vote?
Certainly not.
Will Brown do it? Certainly not.
How, then, would the selection of
either of these, candidates, rather than the
other, help the negroes?
No man can say.
n
The old Pops are rather near-sighted
if they have not seen through the mean
ing of that new rule which takes away
the Constitutional rights of the small
country counties.
Where' was the Populist movement
strongest ?
In the country counties.
Whence came the money, the whiskey,
the trickery, and the stuffed ballot
iboxes which kept the Democratic ring
sters in power?
From the big cities.
In making this new rule the secret
purpose was TO PREVENT THE POP
ULIST ELEMENT FROM HAVING
ITS FAIR AND LEGAL PROPOR
TION OF INFLUENCE-

found, principally, in the smaller coun
ties?
Is it not true that the new rule gives
the big cities an enormous increase of
advantage of these country counties?
Will not the necessary consequence be
to deprive the Populist element of their
just and legal share of power?
You will have no hesitation in answer
ing each of those questions with an un
qualified “YES.”
Then was it an accident, that the new
rule was put on us?
Or was it a deep-laid scheme to pre
vent the Populists who supported Smith
from having a square deal afterwards?
Was Hoke so much in dread of the
Populists who gave him their loyal sup
port that he deliberately concocted this
revolutionary device to deprive them of
their fair share of power?
Think it out, old Pop; the facts are
before you.

In the Brooks County Circular the im
plied argument is that, if Joe Brown is
elected Governor, we may expect Social
Equality of the sort advocated and illus
trated by that Cosmopolitan Club din
ner in New York where a lot of white
harlot-at-hearts dined side by side with
a lot of negro men.
A more disgraceful campaign document
we have not seen since 1894, when Hoke
Smith’s friend, Joe Sid Turner, issued
that Rape Circular urging the negroes to
vote for Atkinson against Hines because
Atkinson had “pardoned Adolphus Dun
can, a negro who had twice been con
victed and sentenced to be hanged for
raping a white woman.”
The Brooks County Circular expressly
states that Joe Brown “has never de
clared for Disfranchisement,” and that
he is “BEING ENDORSED BY NE
GRO CONVENTIONS ALL OVER
THE STATE.”
Why are such astounding falsehoods
circulated? Why this deafening noise on
issues that are not at all involved in
the campaign?
The purpose is to call off attention
from issues that are involved.
They don’t want you to meditate upon
the barrenness of Hoke’s record as Gov
ernor, his flop on the early primary, and
his new rule which deprives the country
counties of their Constitutional rights.
Our Populist friends should be care
ful not to make any pledge or cast any
ballot which will fetter their freedom of
action in the national campaign. There
will be a full electoral ticket put out for
Watson and Williams.
We mean to make a resolute effort to
carry the State of Georgia for a native
Georgian. Even if Mr. Bryan should be
the Democratic nominee, we will contest
the state. We want to see whether she
will go against her own son, in favor of
the Illinois man who declared that he
could not support a certain candidate for
Speaker of the House of Representatives
because, as he said, “I cannot afford to
vote for a Confederate soldier.” It may
have been natural for Bryan, a native of
Illinois, to say that; it will be unnatural
if Georgia votes for him against a native
Georgian.
Yes, Governor Smith told his friends
at Bainbridge, laughingly, that he didn’t
care what Watson thought or said, and
that it made no difference to him whether
Watson supported him or not, —it being
a well known fact that Watson had lost
all his following.
As soon as the Governor has his laugh
out, let us all unite in prayer.

By the way, what does the Hoke Smith
organ, the Atlanta Journal, mean by ask
ing this question:
“What has become of the good old
sockless element of the Populist party’*?
Which was the “sockless element,” any
way?
Were not the men of the People’s Partv,
leaders as well as men of the rank and
file, composed of as good material as the
country could furnish?
Was there a braves Union soldier than
General James B. Weaver who, by his
gallantry alone, rose from the ranks?
Was there a braver Confederate soldier
than General Wm. Field, who was one
of Stonewall Jackson’s lieutenants?
Wasn’t Gen. Thos. L. Rosser one of the
most brilliant cavalry officers that rode
with Jeb Stuart?
Didn’t Bryan get and keep his hold
on Nebraska by claiming to be as good a
Populist as any of us, and did he not
vote the Populist national ticxet?
Os such were our leaders. What was
the make-up of our army itself?
Union soldiers who had marched and
fought with Grant and Sherman and
Sheridan and Thomas; Confederate sol
diers who had struggled and suffered,
half-starved and half-naked, with Lee and
Jackson and Forrest and Johnston; far
mers North and South who had never
asked anything of the Government but
equal and exact justice; young lawyers
who had all to lose and nothing to gain
by joining the People’s Party; laboring
men who asked nothing but a fair day’s
wage for a fair day’s work; the un
privileged seeking to set bounds to the
monstrous greed of privilege.
Who were the “sockless” Pops? What
is meant by the sneer?
Let the Hoke Smith organ speak plain
ly, and let us understand one another.
If Hoke’s organ has started out to in
sult the old Populists, as Bryan’s man
ager did in he will discover, as
Bryan did. that the insult will be re
sented.
Considering that 5 the Hoke Smith or
gan, the Atlanta Journal, is so much
afraid that harm will happen to the Pro
hibition law,‘it shows a curious fondness
