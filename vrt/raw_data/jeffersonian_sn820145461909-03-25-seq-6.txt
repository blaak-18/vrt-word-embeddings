LETTERS THE PEOPLE
“WHY BRYAN CAN NEVER BE
PRESIDENT.”
A. L. Heggie, Vaiden, Miss.: I wish
that every voter in the U. S. was a
subscriber to your paper, then I would
be assured of the fact that you would
be our next president.
I am an old Georgian, born in
Columbia county, six miles from Ap
pling, about one mile from where Maj.
Burt used to IVe. My first teacher
was A. M. I azenby, and would be
glad to km w if he is still living. I
have ofte iieard my deceased father
speak of ,ou, when you were quite a
young nan practicing law at Lincoln
t and Appling. I left Georgia in
December, 1859. Am an old Confed.,
having served under Forrest for three
years. I have always voted for any
and everything the Democratic party
put up until the last election, w T hen I
voted for you. There are thousanls
just like myself, that will never vote
the old ticket again. Dr. Barksdale,
my family physician, and one of the
most learned of his profession, was
at my house a few days ago and I
induced him to take my last magazine
home with him and read it, and es
pecially your editorial, “Why Bryan
Can Never be President.” I met him
the next day and his first words were,
“Here’s a dollar for Tom Watson’s
Magazine.” He said you expressed
his opinion of Bryan ten times better
than he could have done it.
As said above, all that’s necessary
is to get the people to read your
papers.
THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.
I notice a short letter in the Jeffer
sonian from J. R. Norman, of Albia,
la., which, to my mind, speaks vol
umes at the present time. Indeed, I
am of the opinion that one united ef
fort for the initiative and referendum
would accomplish more in the shortest
time than anything else.
I commenced to agitate that question
here in my neighborhood about three
months ago with only one other out
spoken man in favor of the move
ment, and today we have about forty.
1 find many dissatisfied men with the
present political situation who actual
ly believe it impossible to ever accom
plish all the demands favorable to the
people, and it is next to impossible
to get them to entertain for one mo
ment the propriety of fighting for
those demands. But with this same
class I find that the initiative and
referendum takes with them better
than anything else.
It is very easy to explain to such
men that direct legislation is just and
honest, and it stops the mouths of the
political demagogues for they cannot
meet the issue, nor deny the fact that
the majority ought to rule.
When once the common people can
be made to realize that they can rule,
then, and not until then, will you see
thousands of them come out squarely
for the reforms we need. “We can’t”
is the hardest part of the matter to
overcome. Show them that “we can”
and you will find many falling into the
ranks of the reform movement that
are now standing aloof.
I know men right here that would
vote for public ownership of railroads, •
and money issued by the government,
based upon the government’s credit
and loaned to the people, who would
not have done so three months ago.
What brought about the change in
these men’s minds'? A thorough ex
planation of the initiative and refer
endum did it.
No wit is an established fact that
without the initiative and referendum
no reformation can ever be had. Then
why not work for one thing at a time,
and do that work unitedly and for all
time to come? The first step to be
made is for the people of each state
to unite and demand of their legisla
ture to submit to the people a con
stitutional amendment giving the peo
ple the right of the initiative and ref
erendum, or the right to vote directly
upon any question they may deem
necessary. When this is accomplished
(and without it, nothing will ever be
accomplished) the people will then be
in position to go after other measures,
and get ’em. Do you see the point?
Thousands of men who are dis
gusted at the workings of the politic:?
ring would fall in line with this one
leading issue who could not be in
duced to undertake to accomplish the
w’hole thing at one stroke.
Let’s hear from others on the sub
ject through the Jeffersonian.

FEMALE OR WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Holyoke, Cgl., Mar. 5, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: The excitement of the
late political contest is in the past.
The smoke of the contest, having lift
ed, revealed the Bryan banner trailing
in the dust, and the democratic mule
struggling and gasping by the road
side; Taft has been cro-inaugurated;
we are all now 7 in a state of mind to
view matters political less prejudi
cially.
In back numbers of the two Jef
fersonians, I have noticed that you
and some of your lady correspondents,
if not directly opposing woman suff
rage, at least, look upon the idea
with disfavor. It seems to me that
matter was disposed of, settled be
yond cavil, doubt or controversy many
years ago in a manner that puts it be
yond the power of courts or legisla
tures to deny or deprive women of
their right to vote. They have the
same legal, the same constitutional,
right to the ballot in every state as
have the men.
I am no lawyer or interpreter of the
law; only an old farmer—have lived
my eighty-one years in rural districts
and have little knowledge of legal
lore; but I view the Bible and the U.
S. Constitution as two guides that say
what they mean and mean what they
say, and need neither Priest, Bishop
nor Pope to interpret the one, nor
Lawyer, Judge or Supreme Court (all
with big caps) to put a “construc
tion” upon the other.
Amendment to the Constitution,
Art. XIV, Sec. 1, reads. “All persons
born or naturalized in the U. S.
and subject to the jurisdiction there
of are citizens of the U. S. and of the
State wherein they reside. No State
shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or im
munities of citizens,” etc.
'Jeffersonian
Article XV.
Sec. 1. “The rights of the citizens
of the U. S. to vote shall not be denied
or abridged by the U. S. or by any
State,” etc.
Is a woman a person? If so and
she was born or naturalized in the U.
S. her citizenship cannot be ques
tioned. If a citizen, no State has the
pow r er to enforce laws that abridge
any of her rights which are the same
as those of any other “person” who
is a citizen according to Art. XV.
One of the rights of citizenship is
that of voting. According to Art. 15
that right shall not be denied or
abridged by the U. S. or by any State;
and yet, with the exception of Colo
rado, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, the
U. S. and all the States, individually
and collectively, ignore the Constitu
tion while the legislatures of Massa
chusetts, Idaho and Ohio, ten years
ago, openly violated it by defeating
woman suffrage bills and are in un
censured violation of it still. No state
legislature has a right to consider such
a bill. Woman suffrage is a constitu
tionally guaranteed right as strongly
as the right is guaranteed to men, and
all that is needed for women to do is
to claim that right before a registra
tion board and at the polls and if
denied take it into court, where any
judge having a knowledge of the Con
stitution, any sense of honor and jus
tice, any respect for the rights of
citizens, will render a verdict in their
favor; otherwise the Constitution is a
nullity, a document that says one
thing and means some other thing or
else means nothing at all.
The objectionable feature which
you and a lady writer in a recent
number of the Jeffersonian speak of
as possible results of placing the bal
lots in the hands of women have not
manifested themselves during the
fourteen years women have been ex
ercising the right of suffrage in Colo
rado.
Women voters have not “unsexed”
themselves mentally or otherwise at
the polls or elsewhere. They have not
become “political brawlers” on the
streets, on the rostrum, at the polls
or elsewhere.
Instead of lowering the standard of
womanhood, their presence at the polls
‘ 1 where they rub elbows with the igno
rant and the vulgar,” has had an
elevating and refining influence. No
more is heard, at the polling place, the
profane language and ribald jest of
former days. No more does the air
of the polling room reek with the
smoke of cigar and pipe. To the
woman voter is accorded the same
courtesy, the same respect, os would
be shown her in the parlor, at a
social gathering or in a church; while
she. exercising her rights, as a citizen,
at the ballot box, has lost none of her
femininity, but still remains the same
modest, self-respecting, sympathetic,
home-loving, affectionate wife, mother,
sister or daughter, to all her duties
ever faithful.
Proud is every Populist in Colorado,
that a Populist governor, Davis H.
Waite, in Dee., 1893, attached his sig
nature to the Woman Suffrage bill,
which act made it a law in Colorado
in conformity with the National Con
stitution.
During the past winter another
State, Washington, has been added to
the “Female Suffrage” list while the
house of representatives of North
Dakota violated the United States
Constitution by defeating a woman
suffrage bill that had passed the
Senate.
Unless it can be proven that a
woman is not a person she has the
same legal right to the ballot as any
man, be he white, brown or black,
or else the Constitution is a meaning
less instrument.
That you may live to see the ballot
in the hands of all white women and
the success of Populistic principles is
the sincere wish of
Yours for the right,
E. E. T. Hazen.
PLAIN TALK IN THE JEFFER
SONIAN.
Canon, Ga., Feb. 16, 1909.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Friend: Enclose two dollars,
for which please extend my subscrip
tion another year for the two Jeffer
sonians. The weekly Jeffersonian usu
ally reaches me about Thursday every
week. Sometimes it fails to come on
this day and when this mishap oc
curs the disappointment is so great
that it reminds me of going to meet a
relative or a good friend expected on
a certain train and who fails to show
up.
Mr. Watson, there is not a man in
this country that has got sense enough
to go to mill and back but what
can understand the plain, unvarnished
truths that you so fearlessly and
forcibly teach. It is only deep seated
prejudice and moneyed interests that
mother your opposition.
Wishing you a prosperous year in
your great labors, I remain as ever,
Your true follower,
A. L. Hairston.
LET US VOTE FOR PRINCIPLE
AND NOT FOR NAME.
Route 1, Butler, Ga.
The Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sirs: Inclosed you will
find a money order for the weekly
Jeffersonian. I have been taking the
Jeffersonian for the past twelve
months and can not be without it. I
think it is the best paper that is pub
lished in the United States, and every
man that gets his living by the sweat
of the brow should be an ardent suj>
porter of you and the reform cause.
Now, let me say to all that may read
this, my first letter to any paper,
let us vote for principle and not for
name. I admire Hon. Thomas E.
Watson because he fights our wrongs
to a finish and stands for our rights.
If I had the power, I would elect
him to any office he wanted in a mo
ment.
Why, down here the third day of
November we carried our precinct,
3 to 1, for Hon. Thomas E. Watson.
That is the way all of us stand. Had
we won, then we would have had as
President as noble and true-hearted a
man as there is in the United States.
I certainly did endorse your edi
torial written the 17th of December
on “Foreign Missions.”
Your true friend,
J. J. Jones.
