cratic friends to come with us, scrape
off the barnacles, put in new, sound
timbers, make her seaworthy and we
will furnish a captain who knows his
bearings. Why will one set of peo
ple be so bold as to ask another to
abandon cardinal virtues and fixed
principles, that they admit are right,
for the sake of an empty, meaning
less name, is a little more than an
ordinary Populist can get in his nod
dle. We think it is time the Demo
crats were coming to us. All they
have is the name of the vessel.
When a ship is rebuilt and her own
ers can show that two-thirds of her
construction is new, they are author
ized to change her name, and I am
quite sure the Democratic ship-own
ers would not be held up under this
rule for false swearing ere they get
their bark seaworthy. It is a healthy
sign that so many able Democrats
seem weary and heavy-laden. If they
will just step out and accept Mr.
Watson’s platform, he will give them
rest. Yours very truly,

WAKING UP.
Editor Jeffersonian:—About the
most interesting feature of the For
eign Mission discussion is the free
dom with which his readers com
mend Mr. Watson. It looks as if
their real feelings have been long
bottled up, and that now, having an
opportunity to give them vent, they
express themselves freely and fear
lessly. This is a good sign. It is al
ways a good sign when people begin
to question the authority of the
church on any point. It is a better
sign still when they deny her author
ity altogether. Mr. Watson is going
straight to the Bible on this subject—
showing us how to take the good
book at its face- value—not depend
ing upon somebody else to tell us
what it “means.” When we begin to
poke into the “meaning” of Scrip
ture right then the door is opened
for manipulation—of which we have
enough already. Surely a plain
statement “means” just what it says
and no more—whether applied to
foreign missionary work or anything
else.
The Jeffersonians are carrying this
discussion into thousands of homes,
where it is learned for the first time
that anybody dares to question the
methods or doctrines of the church.
The church and her publications are
supposed by them to say the final
word on all that pertains to religious
work or belief. The Jeffersonians
will set them to thinking. No other
secular paper has ever dared take the
position now occupied by Mr. Wat
son, and many, many good people
will no doubt grope their way out of
spiritual and scriptural darkness by
the light he now holds up for them.
Through it all will be awakened in
many minds the question of the au
thority of the church, and when this
query once becomes dominant it is
“goodbye” to ecclesiastical suprem
acy. We are wont to refer to Romish
countries as “priest-ridden,” “church
governed,” “ruled by hierarchy,”
etc., but it seems to many of us who
have shaken off the coils of orthodoxy
that our own Protestant America is
pretty deep in the mire herself.
Churchism is a grievous burden to
bear, and the foreign missionary
fraud is not the least sore on the
body ecclesiastic.
3effersonian
So it is indeed refreshing to read
the letters from Mr. Watson’s read
ers and friends, as from their tone
and sentiment we can realize that the
people are waking up to their scrip
tural privileges. When we get to the
place where we stop and question the
church as to her right to demand cer
tain things of us the next step will be
to ask her where she gets the right
to tell us what to believe.

DEATH OF THOS. H. LANKFORD.
Thomas H. Lankford, for many
years in the printing and publishing
business in Chillicothe, died at his
home May 29th.
He was born in Monticella, Ken
tucky, in 1849.
At the age of 14 he was appren
ticed to Lucien J. Eastin and
learned the printer’s trade. He fol
lowed this trade in several cities.
Three years were spent on the lower
Mississippi River. Returning to
Missouri he followed the printer’s
trade and assisted in editing a paper
at Glasgow for a number of years.
In August, 1877, Mr. Lankford,
in company with Robert N. Rey
nolds, established the Chillicothe
Crisis, a weekly newspaper. Mr.
Reynolds’ interest was purchased by
Paul J. Dixon in September, 1878,
and the firm of Dixon & Lankford
has since continued to publish the
Crisis and other publications, includ
ing the Missouri World, a weekly pa
per which in the flourishing period
of the Populist party had a circula
tion in every state in the Union.
In 1885 the firm established a
daily paper, the Evening Star, which
was discontinued in 1893.
He was married to Miss Flora
Woodford, January 2, 1883. Their
married life was a very happy one,
and was blessed with four sons and
one daughter, all of whom, with Mrs.
Lankford, survive.
Mr. Lankford was a man of stur
dy nobility of character and with a
purity of life which was unsullied. A
long life in Chillicothe had been so
well spent as to gain him no enemies
but countless friends, who had
learned to love and respect him and
who will cherish his memory long
and tenderly.
He was a man with a bright mind,
well stored with information ac
quired by experience and extensive
and varied reading. He had a won
derfully retentive memory and a
taste for knowledge that kept his
mind in a receptive mood. He was a
broad-minded, large-hearted, sweet
spirited gentleman, contact with
whom was brightening to friends
and family, and whose death will be
widely and sincerely mourned.
The uprightness of some men at
tracts attention because of the strug
gle which they make to maintain it;
but it is given to some choicer spir
its to be good so naturally that their
unobtrusive virtues never cause us
to marvel. Os the latter type was
Thomas H. Lankford.
It is a high tribute to pay to a
man to say that his life had been an
exemplification of the Golden Rule.
It is not surprising that when the
end drew near, he met it without a
fear, and that with a past unsullied
by a shadow he could face his future
with a smile.
