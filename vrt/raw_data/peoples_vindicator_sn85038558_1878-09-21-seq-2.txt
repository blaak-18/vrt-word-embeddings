Un oubtedly it has been asked, and
the a wer, which cannot be disputed v
or gai eayed, is, that to the Demo

Is it not singular then, that we t
should find at this moment a lot of E
political philosophers clamorous with
remedies for evils, more imaginary
than real .ad demanding a trial of I

The VINDICATOR articles in our
several last issus. in n hict., te have I in
been pointed in 4u a1 e"lndltnintion º'f i;
the course of 1certain color' 'Ol men in ci
this parit h, have had a sainutary effect N
in this, that a large lhanhler of good Il
colored men ]ltave called l; halt in this Ip
massing of th,: negroes, which luiant %V
has endeavored and is particularly in
noxious to bring about. rt
Many have visited us to give as- r
orance of their opposition to such
A, course which can only result in le
serious disaster to them. We believe at
them to be in earnest, and we will do Ra
all in our power to encourage their to
efforts. e
We see nothing that the c,,lored t(
man should complain of. lie has b
been amply protected by law. lie t
has hal free access to the public w
schools, which have been much bet- n
ter condcieted than formerly, and he tl
has shardl in the peace, quiet and a
plenty, vhich Democratic govei - n
ment hasrought to this hitherto dis- p
tracted Sate. sl
Good government is shown to his 1
senses t#d when lie combines with b
bad melfor a change, which can only b
be, in ies instance ,and under the t
leadereig now show ' for the worse,

We have only this to say, that: the c
intelligence and virtue of this Stale f
must and wrill rnle it. The days of t
"40 acres and a mule" are happily v
gone never to return, and with the
departure of those dreary days of 1
fraud and rascality goes the misera
ble creatures produced by them. If
the colored men persist in following
Blunt, Lewis and Raby, and their t
dirty white lieutenants, they can only e
expect trouble, for the whites trill not r
submit to these people one moment c
longer. Let them therefore not orly t
consult the peace of the country, but
let them also consult their own inter- B
eats, and by co-operating with the t
white citizen, make lasting and true
ftlends of them.
