house was entered aone .f the par-.
ties down stairs, inclndig sm,,e we
I0. mes and children were brought out.
A waman I know, but whose nnlam I
am unable to give, came op, and she
and Mrs. Blunt became m, violent
that I did not think it was safe for
them to remain. 3he. Blunt kept
lr walking np and 'dow, saying:
od "Shoot, shoot! Why don't you
sd shoot me t" and "Kill him ! Go in
and kill bihns." She had denied that
o he wa in the house, and had declin
Z. ed to give as any assistance in lod
-. Ing hina or any information as to
where be was, but she seemed to
want to be
A MARTYR OR AN ANGEL.
as The other woman was also very
as violent and it was feared that they
would excite our people or some ne
s. groes near there, and I ordered that
g they be taken to the office of the jail.
Mrs. Blunt says I ordered her sent to
*. jail. I did not; and before she reach
oj ed the ofllce Blunt was brought oat,
and I ordered her release. All that
ai talk of Blunt's about taking a vote as
to whether he would be hurt or not,
ell and his refusing to surrender until
,at guaranteed protection, is pure fction
and imagination. The parties who seap.
sk tured him reported that he was fount
fr praying, and that lhe begged them
ill for God's sake not to hurt him, that if
,I they would let him g6'h#lrould It te
g the parish and never come back, sad
,tha Is the first word about his leat.o
to il he parish, and it came from ahim.
tip The gentleman who brought Blunt
out said le had promised to protect
, lim, and requested that be be qpt
o harmed. I s at as e ad nade
m. the promise, we would repeet it Ibd
of not hurt him. Blunt displayed
ite THB MOOT CRINGING COWADICL
of He put out his band to me and
by beged me; for God's, sake, not to
ng let him be hurt. He stated here that
lie I maid I had nothing against him but
ras his politics. This s false. I reard
as him as an incendiary, and I Leheve
lr- he hates a white man worse than any.
sy. thing else on earth. He says white
ins men voted for him, that they scritch,
nd ed his opponent's name and put his in
ill- the place. I do not believe that this
my. is so. The white man who would'
of vote for him'would be regarded as a
ad mnstrosity. Blent has prospered and
db has some little property, wbich is,
bat however, in the name of another per
ras son. He transferred it to Rachel
bat Edwards, who he formerly lived with,
Sif although I belive he was not marred
to her, to protect it from a judgment
gained on Redmond's bond. Several
tst years ago Blunt marched a body of
as, men through the town, we thought,
be with the intention of bulldozing as;
Ads but RIby said it was for the purpose
oId of bulldozsing other men in their own
sm party, there having been a split.
ras Blunt has been a member otshe

et a colored girl at $30 a montb to do

It CUNNINGHAM CONTINUES.
• Raby told me that he did not attend
to the meeting because he knew Blunt
to and Breds contemplated creating a
disturbmane. That evening a party
of negroes did attack the town. The
mayor had appointed me chief of po
r7 lice. As the apprehension of danger
'y was so great and the threatened trou
i ble so serious he asked me to act. I
o placed guards down on a road by
Il. which the negroes could get to town.
to There- was only four of them then,
Ia- and before the attack came several
t of the negroes got by. One of them
was halted, but he presented a gun
is at the young man who stopped him,
t and as he was armed only with a pis.
ail tol he had to let him pass. Other in.
na stances of a similar character were
P- reported. The attack came. One
id hundred and fifty to two hundred
m' men actually came to the bridge.
if The guard heard them down the road,
In and one of them went forward to see
id what it was, He reached the crowd
f* and told them that if they tried to
n" reach the town they would be halted;
it and they said that if they were halt
et ed th would reply with shot. When
it to the bridge they were bhait
they irth a volley. The
guard responded, and I understood
that,some three or four of the ne
groes were wounded and carried off
*a by their friends. They stampeded,
t, and I am satisfied that if it had not
at bdea for their cowardice the town
at would have been burned that night.
rd Their cowardice and the exaggerated
re idea they had of our strength was all
that saved the town. Blunt states
to that he was required to leave the
IN parish, State and United States. No
ia such requirement was made by me,
is nor by any one on my authority.
id Blont himself proposed to leave. He
a says he made a ,equest that three or
n four days be granted him to arrange
li, his business. He never made any
r- such request of me or any one else.
el We had a consultation, and it was
h, decided to accept Blunt's offer to
leave, and. a messenger was instruct.
at aed to notify him of the fact, and give
,t him all the time be wanted. The
of messenger reported that Blunt pre
, fearred p leave that night, and do.
Ssred a guard to wesort him out of the
e parish. A guard was turnished; and
rn be was giten such time as he wasted
It. o see his family. He said some
be thing about armed me lying in wait
9 to kill him. ,He staltd that Allen
b. Wneeler had a band*of armed men
ad to interrupt him,. Wheeler was in
to town dsik. It has .been stated by
g Blunt and other wtiases that Raby
m had not been heard B'oance he h~ft
the pirish,'and that a bd had been
, found, and was qupposed to be his.

- Judge Pierson, and he turned it over
. to nie, and I sent word to Lewis that
I did not want. to harm him. The

td 1 do with politics.
t Blunt states that I ordered him to
a surrender when the party came to his
Y house. I did nothing of the kind.
1e He saw everything and heard every
- thing, he says, and makes this state
r ment when I was not there. He also
'- said that while he was up in the gar.
I ret I was In the house and spoke
' about the means to get to him. I was
ý* not In the house at all. I never
I. heard lie was required to leave the
parisb,-State and United States until
I I read It as coming from himself. He
in says I called on him to disperse the
mob, and that I told him I had noth
- lng against him but his political in.
" fluence. I never told him anything
re of the kind. I told him to send word
le to the negroes to disperse.
If allsthese persons lie refers to
e. talked with him and made him prom
i, iso to leave, it is entirely without my
Sknowledge, and entirely contrary to
'd my instruciions. He brings the may
to or in by stating that lie approved of
I everything lie did, and that I pushed
t- him of'. I have no recollection of
i asy such occurrence. At the election
I everything was peaceable and quiet,
Ie and time colored men voted freely and

i, CROSS-EXAMINED.
, To Mr. Marks-Have lived in the
,t parish of Natchitoches since 18(10. I
n am a lawyer by occupation. Am a
,t. native of Louisiana. I had no office
.d in the parish in 1878, except the tem
,I porary one, as I have stated, as chief
e of police. There was no attack on
1e the Republican meeting by an or
lo ganized body. We have the 298 or
e, ganization. We have charitable and
p" religious organizations, just the same
te as other communities. The 298
sr might be termed a political organisa,,
t tion. I do not consider it as one. I
y know of but organizations of the
e. kind in the parish--one in Natbhito
as ches, and the other in Campte. If
to there was any movement of the or.
t. der I never knew it. I was grand
re commander of the conclave in Natch.
te itoches, and I never gave any orders
Sfor movements. We had no objee.
. tions to being used as a political le
is ver. I mean by that, it the people
d were pleased to consider it a strong
d political body I had no objection. I
never, as commander, used the or
it ganization as a body for the purpose
a of dispersing mobs or protecting the
a town of Natchitoehes. Somebody
a must have a very exaggerated idea
y about the importance of the organi
y zation; I don't.
