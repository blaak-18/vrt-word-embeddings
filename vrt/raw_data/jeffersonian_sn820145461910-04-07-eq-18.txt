My Friends in Old Screven Should
Reprove Rev. J. H. Oliver
Dear Sir:—On the 26th of March
I was at the above named place in
company with several other gentle
men. Among them was a Baptist
minister, by the name of J. H.
Oliver, who preached there. And I
asked him what effect the contro
versy between yourself and Ellis had
on his mission work, and he said it
was never known to be on such a
boom as it was at the present time,
and that you were the biggest liar
he ever saw; that you had made the
statement that women missionaries
got $750 per annum- and the men
got $1,500 per annum for mission
wmrk; he said a bigger lie was never
uttered. I asked when and W’here
did you make that statement, and he
said he saw it in a February issue of
The Jeff. And I replied to him by
saying that I would give him fifty
dollars to produce it, and if the pa
per contained it I would give him
fifty dollars to prove it -was not true.
And he said to me that I was the
first man who had ever accused him
of lying. I told him I could noti help
it, that I had never been able to catch
you lying, and I had no apologies to
make. Will you kindly answer this
through your weekly Jeff?
Yours very truly,
Halcyondale, Ga. H. G. BELL.
Answer.
I will give to Mercer University
one hundred dollars for every “lie”
that the Rev. J. H. Oliver can prove
on me; and will leave the decision
of the question to the Faculty of the
College.
Now, Brother Oliver, trot out your
proof that I have been “lying”, on
this Mission question.
Have you investigated the subject
at all? Have you studied mission
ary literature, as I have done? Do
you not know that It ■would ruin me
to wilfully misrepresent the facts, —
and that I am as well aware of it as
you can be?
Now listen:
There are 64 different missionary
organizations in this country, all
howling for more money; and the
salaries paid by these 64 societies
are not uniform. Some pay one
thing, and some another.
Yes, I did say that the young
ladies were paid $750 per annum.
All of them do not get that much,
but some receive more than that.
The Woman’s Board of Foreign
Missions of the M. E. Church, South,
publishes a magazine known as Wo
man’s Missionary Advocate.
The July issue, 1909, page 17, con
tains a statement of “Appropria
tions”. ’Tis a cheerful list of sala
ries, and things. It starts off:
“Shanghai: Miss Richard-
son’s salary $ 750.
Nliss Clairborne’s salary .... 750.
Miss Wasson’s salary 750.
Miss Mann’s half salary 500.
Three new missionaries and
travel 2,550.
Sungkong: Salary of Mrs.
Gaither 750.
Then come Mrs. S. S. Harrfs,
Miss Nettie Peacock and a
whole lot more, each re
ceiving the neat sum of. . . 750.
The account runs on for five
pages; and the almost universal
salary for the ladies is $750 apiece.
The Christian Woman’s Board of
Missions publishes a monthly maga
zine named Missionary Tidings. Its
title tells it’s purpose. And it lives
up to its name. It furnishes infor
mation concerning the work. In the
November issue, 1909, page 308 and
those following, the magazine pre
sented an itemized account of re
ceipts and expenditures.
At Bilaspur, India, this Board was
paying four girls salaries of S6OO
apiece. At Bina Mr. and Mrs. Elsam
drew $1,200 for themselves, and
S3OO for their children.
At Calcutta, W. E. McDougall got
$1,250 for his salary.
At Deogarh, four Misses got S6OO
each. At Pendara Road, Mr. and
Mrs. Madsen received $1,200, plus
S3OO for their children.
In Jamaica, W. 1., Arnold Shirley
and Henry Cotterell w’ere paid sala
ries of $750 apiece.
For reasons which we can readily
imagine, some of the workers are
paid less; but under this Board the
salary of an unmarried lady is usual
ly $600; while that of a married
couple is $1,200, with an attach
ment (pay for children) which must
greatly tend to stimulate compliance
with the injunction to “multiply and
replenish”.
Os course, you are to understand
that a dollar in India goes further
than three will in this country, prices
being so much lower there.
On page 191 of the book, “Mis
sions and Mission Methods”, (by
Rev. J. M. Milburn, of Union City,
Tenn.) is described the manner in
which missionaries who know the
ropes and are in the swim get sala
ries of SI,OOO for themselves and
SSOO for their wives—a net compen
sation of $1,500 in foreign countries
where that sum is equal to three and
four thousand dollars here. Mr.
Milburn mentions names, too.
Now put your wits to work:
The wife of the foreign mission
ary has to keep house. She bears
children, who, of course, require the
mother’s tender and constant care
during infancy. How much evan
gelical work can that mother do to
earn her $500? In many cases,
don’t you feel that the amount add
ed for the wife and children is a mere
subterfuge of the missionary to get
a bigger salary for his own dear
self?
There was nothing from me on
Foreign Missions, in the February
number of the Magazine; and if
ever the types have made me say that
the missionaries are paid $1,500 per
year, it was an error. After reading
Mr. Milburn’s revelations, as to how
the same man can draw three differ
ent allowances, it would be perfectly
legitimate for me to allege that some
of the foreign missionaries get
$1,500. When they add on for chil
dren, they get even more.
It seems to me nothing less than
scandalous to allow a man to draw
SSOO, as a preacher, SSOO, as a
medical missionary, and SSOO for his
wife—and then more as children
come.
I did not know until now that
such shameless tricks as that could
be practised on the “Boards”.
Without the connivance of those
who control the Boards, such a thing
would be impossible.

From the Old War-Horse of
lowa
Hon. Thos. E. Watson:—Yours of
2 7th ult. is before me and read with
interest. You write, “You ask me
what are we to do?” “Frankly, I
don’t know.” “The Democratic par
ty is chaotic; the Republican party
is becoming so; the Populist party
is dead, and we are all at sea.”
I write—if we are all at sea—
thank God we are in an open boat,
with strong oars in lock, and a mul
titude of willing hands to help row
the boat somewhere, or anywhere, so
as we row with a set purpose to land
somewhere or anywhere, rather than
float with the tide as it comes and
goes, with no land in sight.
Either I am purblind as to exist
ing facts and the powers that be that
are fearfully antagonistic to the gen
eral welfare of all the actual pro
ducers of wealth within our nation,
or the general business interests of
our entire peoples are on the crest of
the most terrific business volcano
this nation of business ever wit
nessed. I predict that within less
than a half dozen years a business
panic will strike in the stock market
and send (now) strong men to the
wall of bankruptcy. The money
lending interests have the specula
tive and productive interests in their
wicked grasp at the present time, and
when comes the fateful hour, no
mercy will be shown, except that
which will contribute to accomplish
ing the devilish purposes of the shy
locks of the world, the money-lend
ers. One difficulty I perceive is, so
many teachers in the field of needed
reforms, who are disagreeing with
others who allege that they are ab
solutely right, and all others abso
lutely wrong. I have myself blushed
until my cheeks were red hot; and
all because I had to apologize for
some blundering statement made by
prominent members of the reform
forces.
We ought to have a code of facts,
and statements, based on a code of
facts that every writer and speaker
could and -would tie to, and speak to,
and write to, and about, so critically
correct that no apology or excuse
need be required, or offered.
At the close of the 48th Congress
I held up for nearly an hour the
joint resolution to bestow on Mrs.
Grant a very large pension, as its last
closing act; and was moved thereto
by the fact that General Grant had
already received from the Govern
ment very large sums of money; and
the further fact that while he was
President he signed the Salary Grab
Steal Bill with one dip of his pen,
and with the very next dip of his pen
he vetoed the measure to equalize
the pay and bounty to the United
States soldiers. The history of the
leadership of the Republican party
from 1865 to the present date is
loaded with rotten, corrupt, villain
ous deeds.
If you could get before the intelli
gent voters of the country a glaring
array of the awful facts in chrono
logical order, so that there could be
no reasonable dispute as to the ac
tual facts, then go before the
voters in the entire country with
such an array of facts in book form,
with proofs irrefragable, it seems to
me that the voters from high to low
could be so awakened that an exodus
from the Republican political party
would take place that would astonish
the most sanguine of the G. O. P.
Can this array of facts be gath
ered and put in book form? May
God Almighty help the people who
do not seem to know enough to help
themselves. L. H. WELLER.

SLIP.
A Desirable Petticoat Slip.
With the vogue of semi-transpa
rent dress fabrics, it becomes almost
imperative to wear a slip or Prin
cess petticoat underneath. It may
be of silk, satin, nainsook, longcloth
or sateen. It takes the place of both
corset cover .and underskirt. The de
sign is simple and can be developed
at home at about half the cost of a
ready made slip. The pattern is cut
in six sizes, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42
inches bust measure, and requires 8
yards of 36-inch material for the 36-
inch size.
A pattern of this illustration mail
