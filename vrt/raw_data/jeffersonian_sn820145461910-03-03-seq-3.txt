THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE OTHERWISE,
AND A FEW LACONICS
WHERE SOCIALISTS AND AN
ARCHISTS GET IN THEIR
WORK.
Philadelphia may be slow, but
when it comes to riots and parades,
she’s right there with the goods.
The latest cause of excitement in
the Pennsylvania city is a street car
strike. Dynamite, soldiers, and other
gentle means are being used by the
strikers to enforce their claims, and
by the State to enforce the law. Up
to date several have been killed,
some innocent and more or less dis
interested have been injured, and the
end is not yet.
The police have frankly admitted
their inability to cope with the mat
ter, and the State troops have been
appealed to for aid.
With the lawless foreign element
so rapidly developing in the United
States/ there is a close resemblance
in every so-called labor trouble to
that which other cities have to rec
ord.
Almost unwittingly our labor
bodies have absorbed the Socialistic
and Anarchistic doctrines of “kill”
“4ft|troy”, before they have become
bj’oughly acquainted with the
Jis on which they start their trou
jie.
The labor bodies have accomplish
ed much for the workingman—and
they have harmed him much.
The strike of the Philadelphia
carmen was brought about for the
usual reasons: long hours, low pay,
hard rules and little consideration
from the company toward its em
loyees.
No one can find fault with the men
b/ving a grievance, nor for their
fforts to better their condition.
But when lawlessness steps in,
when children are killed, property
destroyed, the whole business of a
city tied up, isn’t it time to call a
halt?
And, when the truth is known, the
Socialist and the Anarchist will be
found rampant and mouthy, inflam
ing sullen minds with the doctrine
of destruction, and the whole world
of organized labor suffers as the re
sult.
Where arbitration is not possible
between employer and employee,
there are other means of bringing
grievances and injustices before the
public, and the public always sides
with the workingman for the simple
reason that it is the workingman
who makes up the public.
Philadelphia’s loss will be the
country’s gain if it will teach those
who have joined labor organizations
in good faith, that nothing can be
attained by the methods pursued in
this late outbreak. Itwould seem the
labor organizations were in need of
reorganization on a broader and
saner basis, one that will prevent a
recurrence of the trouble Philadel
phia is experiencing.

A Baltimore woman wants a di

Why didn’t she try the clothes pin

China has been invaded by two
American “amusements” —the cake
walk and roller skating. Other civil

rapidly.

One look at a woman’s hat would
be sufficient to convince any man
that the price of feather dusters
might go up, with reason, but the
rise in brooms is unexplainable.

The postal savings bank looks good
to the average citizen, as there seems
less possibility of absconding cash
iers and fewer chances for officials to
get gay with other people’s money.

This is the season when the small
boy begins to save up his coin and
the office boy to think up new ex
cuses for getting off the job. The
open season for baseball will soon be

A recent scientific discovery is to
the effect that, above the “storm
strata” is total darkness. This will
doubtless make the air ship builders
less keen about laying a right-of
way above the clouds.

By and large, the farmers of the
United States have had enough ad
vice handed them to enable them to
publish several books. But most of
them need a few new farm imple
ments and a lift with the mortgage.

The New York cotton brokers ob

planter in the South who gets the lit

Mr. Taft’s smile begins to resem
ble that of the bride whose pretty
white satin shoes hurt. With all the
laundering of Republican linen that
is being done, the Executive doubt
less feels more like moaning than
smiling.

South Carolina will doubtless re
vise some others of her laws, since
she realizes the unfairness of the
one giving a father the right to dis
pose of his children, even when the
mother is living and able to care for
them.

The year 1910 is young yet, but
more political secrets have leaked
out than the whole year of 1909
witnessed. With every charge of
bribery and rascality in high places,
have come counter-charges, and
many a once honored name is trail
ing in the dust of political scandal.

Virginia has repudiated the pro
posed State-wide prohibition bill.
After noting how prohibition does
not prohibit, it’s a wise move on the
part of Virginia’s Senate. When the
people as a whole shall voice their
sentiment by popular vote, the re
sult will justify whatever the State
will adopt.

The cold storage people say
“everything comes out as it goes in”;
not so’s the ultimate consumer can
notice it. Eggs “go in” at fifteen
cents per dozen and “come out” at
forty. Meats are stored when their
price is fourteen cents, and are
brought out when they have reached
twentyfive.

Atlanta has been promised a bond
issue that will give many needed im
provements. If the money could be
put in the custody of men too old or
too honest to get away with it, the
city might get “all that was coming
to it.” But, unfortunately, big sums
of municipal money have wondrous
powers of shrinkage before its mis
sion is fulfilled.

Well, we’re going to have another
titled couple added to the American

young woman is going to regild the

Court News.

The German Socialists are having
a real merry time of it in Berlin, and
their methods of argument are along
the bloody lines followed by the
American Socialists, who break loose
every once in so often. The Germans
are less tolerant than Uncle Sam, and
a number of the “leaders” are cool
ing their heels and their eloquence
in German jails.

The officers of the Nicaraugan
army have the fighting game down to
a science. While the armies are
chasing each other all over the map
of Nicarauga, the officers sit in their
offices and get reports via long-dis
tance ’phone or telegraph. This
ought to be a big saving—in officers’
lives, any way.

JPeary, as an explorer and god
father to the North Pole, doesn’t
seem to loom much biggei- than Dr.
Cook. A fat purse and a high-sound
ing title are not to be bestowed on
him by Congress, as has been pro
posed. If transportation could be
arranged, the gentleman might make
a deal with the ice trust.

It is evident to the Republican
party by now, that too much tinker
in with the tariff has given the
trusts excellent excuses for raising
prices on everything. It’s true the
ultimate consumer can’t see just
why this should be, but the Republi
cans have never been noted for ex
plaining the reason of any of their
peculiar attitudes on any matter, to
anybody.
* * *
The Washington aggregation evi
dently regard the tariff, its bills, re
forms, et al., as a very interesting
ball of knitting. Should they ever
leave it alone or decide one way or
the other how to dispose of it, they
might have to face other real and
important issues. This they don’t
want to do, evidently, and the merry
talkfest goes on, while the people
pay the price and try to solve their
own problems.
* * *
New York husbands, when they
tire of their wives, are very con
siderate (?) in their disposal of
same. After a search, the police
tore up the floor of a house in one of
the most thickly settled sections of
the city and found the body of a
woman who had been killed by her
husband. Landlords will have to add
clauses to leases now, forbidding
tenants to use the floors as receiving
vaults.

The boys of Georgia’s School of

From prize fights to matrimony
John L. Sullivan, the “champion”
mauler of other people’s personality,
seems to win out. After a stormy,
troublous experience with one wife,
in which booze played a large part,
the prize fighter reformed. His sec
ond matrimonial alliance was entered
only a short while ago, but there are
breakers ahead, as the first Mrs.
Sullivan declares she is legally the
“only.”
