Headache?
If it does, you should
try Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain
Pills. Why not do so.
They will relieve the
pain in just a few min
utes. Ask your druggist
There are 45,000 druggists
4 in the U. S. Ask any of
them. A package of 25
doses costs 25 cents. One
tablet usually stops a
headache. They relieve
pain without leaving any
disagreeable after-effects
—isn’t that what you
want?
“My son Frank Snyder has used
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Fain Pills for a long
time. He never had anything to
help him so much for headache. A
year ago he came home, and I was
down sick with such a dreadful nerv
ous headache. He gave me one of
the Anti-Pain Pills, and after while
I took another and was entirely re
lieved. I always keep them in the
house now, and gave many away to
others suffering with headache.”
MRS. LOUISE LEWELLYN,

Your druggist sells Dr. Mlles’ Antl-
Paln Pills, and we authorize him to
return the price of first package (only)

The Hocus Pocus Money Book”
Published In 1904, showed that existing condi
tions made a commercial panic in the near
future inevitable —and why? Its 200 pages are
filled with incontrovertible economic principles
and astonishing facts, sustained by figures from
the U. S. Comptroller’s Reports, and bank or
gans, proving that the deposit banking system
—as it has been maneged in the past—ls the
real cause of every commercial panic ever
known, and most of the periods of business de
pression that have afflicted this country. And,
what is still more important, It shows how their
recurrence can be made impossible—and the de
mand for services and products made to always
equal the supply—without wronging any one, or
costing the people a dollar. Book sellers and
news dealers can not afford to antagonize the
banks by handling this book. Do not blame
them—but send for the book yourself. Terms,
by mail: Single copy, 25 cents, 5 for fl. Ad
