ON PRIZE-FIGHTING.
Dear Sir: —What do you think of
the great Jeffries-Johnson fight? Do
you suppose Jeffries, who, I suppose,
claims to own Anglo-Saxon blood, a
real patriotic sport, wants to spat
ter his blood with .that of a big,
black, burly Ethiopian. Jeffries
ought to be whipped, and if Johnson
does not do it, I suppose he will then
go over to Africa and want to fight
the most ferocious ape or gorilla in
the jungles of Johnson’s home.
Kindly let me have your views of
it.
Sincerely,
J. B. S.
Valdosta, Ga.
(I think that any white man who
fights a prize fight with another
white man, is a Brute. If he fights
a nigger P. F., he is lower than a
Brute. T. E. W.)
MORE CHALLENGERS FOR DR.
BROUGHTON.
Dear Sir: —Please send your book
on Missions to Elder Jordan Cribs,
Collins, Ga. Enclosed find 25 cents
for same.
The Primitive Baptists are de
lighted with your Scriptural exposi
tion of Missions. The light should
be turned on, and save many dear
children of God from the error of
their way.
If Elder Broughton wishes to de
bate the Mission question in Macon,
we will furnish a man that will de
bate with him. Elder Cayce, of Ten
nessee; Elder J. S. Newman, Glen
rose, Texas, or Elder S. A. Paine, of
?Dublin, Texas, will debate the sub
ject with him. Would like for you
to attend if they do.
Yours truly,

ATTORNEY ARNOLD CALLS ON
THE OLD GUARD.
Death has claimed some, some
have gone over to one of the old par
ties, a few have joined the Socialists.
What I want to know is. who of us
during the shifting scenes of the
past few years have “kept the faith.”
I want to know who have stood the
storm. I want to know how many
of the “Old Guard” stand on the
Omaha platform and endorse the gal
lant fight that our much beloved
friend, Watson, is making. I want
a short letter from those who stood
on the “firing lines” in the 90’s. I
-want to know where you stand now,
and w T hat your views are. Give a
short letter through The Jefferson
ian. I want to hear from such Popu
lists as Morgan, W. S. J. Parker,
Jerry Scanlon, Samuel W. Williams,
James Darwin, H. M. McCuisten, J.
W. Baird, Oliver Jones, J. O. A.
Bush, Ed. Arnold, Colonel Files,
John H. Cherry, Dr. Clark, of In
diana; Dr. Pat. B. Clark, Madrass,
Texas.; J. G. Dial, Tom Anderson,
Blossom, Texas, and hundreds of vo
ters, whose names I could call, and
thousands whose names I can not
call. Every “Old Guard” is not only
invited to join in this love feast of
exchanging thoughts of the past* but
now are urged to respond to this re
quest. And if you are not a sub
scriber to the “Jeffs” send Tom a
dollar with your letter and let’s get
busy for the next few weeks. It will
do me and all the “Old Guard” good
to know where you are at and what
you are doing, and if you are still in
grace. I say it will do each of us
good from a social standpoint, as
well as from a political standpoint.
Who will be first?
As ever, yours for reform,
B. F. ARNOLD.

HOLINESS. MY GOOD FRIEND
JOHN WALLER IS WELL
POSTED.
(Remember John, that my re
marks applied to the men who claim
that they cannot sin.)
Dear Tom:—l am very sorry in
deed that you made any reply to
Brother A. B. Bell, the layman, on
Holiness, further than “That’s a
ticklish subject to tackle”, and then
referred him to the teaching of our
Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. If you will take time to
read the 17th chapter of St. John
you will find that Christ in His
prayer for His disciples who were
not of the world (as He, Christ,)
was not of the world; that they
might be sanctified. Here is what
Christ prayed: “Sanctify them
through Thy truth: Thy Word is
truth.” Now, Tom, I don’t think
either you nor Brother Bell can prove
by the Bible that the disciples were
not converted at the time the Blessed
Saviour offered this prayer. Now, if
they were converted and had to be
sanctified, of course here is where
the second state of grace comes in,
etc. Now, I don’t think that you nor
Brother Bell ever heard a professer
of Holiness say that they had reached
a state in religion when they could
not sin. If so, you have heard a
great deal more than ever I heard. I
have had the pleasure of attending
a great many of their meetings, and
never heard such an utterance as “I
have reached a state in religion
where I can not sin”. All of this is
a mode of bluff by people who op
pose a life of Holiness and sanctifica
tion, without which we are taught
in the Bible that no man shall see
the Lord. I am glad to say that I
have heard not only Methodists tes
tify to this blessed experience, but
Baptists and Presbyterians as well.
I am glad to say also that I believe
that this blessing is obtainable here
on earth ; if not I am sure it is not
obtained hereafter, for as a tree fall
eth so it lieth. Let me refer you to
a few of the many passages of scrip
ture teaching on this subject: 11 vers.
6 chap. Ist Corrinthians, 23 and 27
verses 5 chap. 2 Thessalonians, 10
vers. 10 chap. Hebrews, 3 chap. Ist
John, 5-6-7 verses, and many more
passages too numerous to mention.
Now, Tom, you have too much in
fluence to criticize the living of Holy
and sanctified lives in the manner in
which you have done.
Your true friend,
J. W. WALLER.
Culverton, Georgia.
ANOTHER ONE, ON HOLINESS.
Well, Tom, do you answer all ques
tions? Perhaps had you not gone
where angels dare not tread, and in
vaded the missionary field, you
might not have been called upon for
an opinion on the “Second blessing”
theory. But in this, as in most other
things, you are found equal to the
task.
This scribe has most vivid recol
lections of the holiness wave that
struck this end of the country some
years ago. Most of us went up and
“gave our hand” for the blessing.
Lots of ’em got it, and lots that
thought they did, didn’t.
It, perhaps, was a good thing, but
it seemed to lack sticking qualities.
It was a very serious problem, but,
nevertheless, it had its humorous
phases. I now recall one. A very
poor family, who plowed a steer to
make the crop, whose education had
been to the effect that to plow the
brute was an utter impossibility
without profanity, under the per
suasive eloquence of the Holiness
man all went up and “gave their
hand”—all except John. John set
back with stolid indifference. Broth
er and sister, in turn with oth
ers, went after him, pouring in
to his ear the delectableness of the
new achievement, but no good.
Finally his mother, with full assur
ance, made her way through the
shouting assembly, and above the
din, the hallelujahs and the loud
amens of the new converts, could be
heard her beseech ments, such as
none but a devoted mother can make.
3eft r ersonian
Everybody was expecting that John
would “come across,” and would
head for the altar to give his hand
for the blessing. As soon as there
was a lull, so that he could make
himself audible, John began to rea
son logically. Said he, “Now, mam,
its like this: you’ve got ’em, and
pap’s got em, and Sal’s got ’em, and
Jap’s ’em. Now spose I go in there
and git ’em, I’d like to know who in
the deuce would plow that measly
old steer?”
* * #
I thought you would have to skid
doo when that Rev. Cullud Gemman
up Norf come at you for an explana
tion about your being such a mix
ture of right and wrong. I thought
he had “sho nuff” got you. I follow
ed on to see you bob up on top, and
I guess the brother in ebony is satis
fied since you informed him that he
was a step “up” from the gorilla.
Now you might give us an opinion
on evolution.
PHILOM.
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUES
TION.
Dear Mr. Editor:—Your answer to
“A Layman on Holiness,” as proposed
by the gentleman at Ashburn, Ga.,
Mr. A. B. Bell, is before the public,
and is unsatisfactory to some, as
there are tw 7 o sides to all issues. I
ask that both sides have a ventila
tion, more especially as you are fair
enough to give all an equal show.
This is noble. Your answer to the
“Layman” was a masterpiece in sup
port of the anti-holiness idea of the
question. But as this is a “ticklish
subject” and has to do with the Holy
Bible fc we would not dare to grve our
own views on same, because no one’s
opinion on this momentous theme is
worth anything at all, neither mine,
yours, nor any other mortal’s.! would
first cite Mr. Bell to some facts on
record. Every one familiar with the
history of the Popes of Rome can lay
at their door the very first proposi
tion that Christians are sinners.
When Catholicism instituted the
“confessional” in order that money
might flow into the coffers of the
hierarchy, then it was that men first
learned that none were to be esteem
ed as “saints,” or none were holy, ex
cept the Pope and the priest—all
others were vile sinners, and must go
to “confession” as oft as they could
raise the cash to pay for the prayers
offered by the “holy father.” This,
Mr. 8., is where the idea originated
that all men must sin and confess eter
nally, together with other pernicious
and inconsistent doctrines. These
errors, of course, were brought out
from the old mother Catholic by se
ceders, and have been handed down
the ages by Protestants (of which, no
doubt, Mr. Watson will treat in his
Magazine this year). When error has
taken root, it takes ages to destroy
it. Thus we find Calvinists of all
Christendom still propagating that
old doctrine instigated by the Popes
of Rome. But turn to the law book,
as Mr. Watson would in a civil court.
It is not whether men or devils,
saints or sinners, ever lived a life of
holiness, but what says the book?
The evidence, briefly: Enoch walked
Missionaries Wanted
To Take Up Collections For
Watson’s Magazine
and The Jeffersonian
YOU WILL GET A RAKE-OFF
Write for particulars to THE JEFFS, Thomson, Ga.
with God three hundred years, and
God took him because he was so
holy. Elijah was carried in a whirl
wind of fire because he was so holy.
God met the Devil and asked if he
knew 7 Job to be a perfect and upright
man, and who did not sin? God met
Abraham and said, “be thou perfect.”
They w 7 ere both holy men. Moses was
so holy that God allowed him to even
look upon His back on Mount Sinai
and had many conversations with
him, and afterwards took him to
Heaven alive. Christians w 7 ere called
saints all through the New 7 Testa
ment, Mr. Watson to the contrary,
however. Christ said, “Be ye holy,
for I am holy. He preached of
righteousness (holiness) from start
to finish. He came to “condemn sin
in the flesh.” It means, here on
earth, Mr. B. The Apostle Luke says
that Christians are to “serve Him in
holiness all the days of our lives.”
Paul says that saints are to “serve
Him in the spirit of holiness, in the
fear of the Lord,” and to partake of
His holiness. In many places Paul
said. “Salute the holy brethren,”
(not holy gods), and that they should
“life up holy hands,” and that “Bish
ops must be holy” people. Peter
said be “holy in conversation,” and
that “women must be holy.” John
said that only the holy can have part
in the first resurrection, “that he
who commits sin is of the Devil,” and
that “he who is born of God does not
commit sin.” Paul said, “Without
holiness no man can see the Lord.”
My brother, do you think holiness a
prerequisite? The book says so, you
see. Christ and all the apostles
taught that sanctification was a
spirit’s work of grace. See Acts 2,
Acts 19, Acts 10, etc., etc. Now, the
half is not told. I would ask Brother
B. and Brother T. E. W. to search the
old book more closely.
