Day by day the Populist claim
thait railroads should be run iby tlhe
governnment is being acc entuated
by actual tests. The Northeastern
railroad recently fell into the hands
of the state of Georgim, being
abandoned by the owners as worth
less. The state having guaranteed
the bonds, took the road and ope.
rihed it. The result was that the
road last year paid all operating
expenses, interest on the bonds,
and turned $12,000 into the state
treasury. Let the government take
the whole lot of them and do like
wise.
Is This Anarohy.
Is it anarchy to demand the tree
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
toll
Is it anarchy to ask for an in
crease in the circulation medium I
Is it anarchy to ask for a gradn
ated Income tax ?
Is it anarchy to advocate the es
tablishment of governnent banks
Is it anarchy to say the govern
ment should own and operate tihe
railroads, telegraphs and tele
phones I
NATIONAL CO-OPERATION.
The Moneyed Classes Pool The'r Interests
Thus Metting an Example for the People.
Only poor. credulous people believe
in private-that is, individual property.
They can't see an inch ahead of their
noses. Rich people do not have private
property in production except in rare
instances. Every trust I can think of
is a co-operation-the co-operation of a
few for unequal benefit. I'ersonal own
ership is sunk in the co-ope-rative own
ership. just as on a still more extensive
and still more successful plan it would
be if umerged into a national co-opera
tion for the equal benefit of all, as in
the postal system. The rich preach to
the poor that there is no incentive to
live if the riyht of individual property
to make money is denied, and then
these rich go right off, turn their indi
vidual property into a corporate prop
erty and have it managed by a board,
and by the combination 'do up" the I
poorer people whom they have taught
to believe in private property. No per
son can say of a railroad train. "this is
mine." lie may say he owns an inter
est in the company. but he does not own
the train or a tie in its bed. Now
let us extendl the railroad corporations,
make them large enough to embrace
all the people in the land and let us all
share in its benefits, as we do in the
postal system--not by dividends paid
to each individual, but by lower rates
and better service. What is true of
railroads is true of telegraph, coal and
oil, sugar and coffee, and all other
products. If the people were not
trained up by kings to believe kings
were na.cessary, nobody would obey
and support kings. So if our people
were not trained to believe in individ
ual property used in producing wealth,
they woull not support the kings
among them, who profit off t heir credu
lity and superstition. The trusts co
operate and are enabled to skin the
whole people. The people should co
operate, do their own business and
there would not be a monopoly in the
land except their own. A monopoly is
all right if all the people own it. It is
all wrong if a part of the people own
it to skin the balance. See?-Coming
Y'tion.
A LIVELY CORPSE.
The Twin Frauds PersIst in Holding a
Wake Over a Body That Is Very Much
Alive.
"I am dying. Egypt. dying." The
old party press and stump yelpers are
repeating the above and applying it to
the people's party, endeavoring to con
vey the idea that the pops are losing
strength. They only wish that their
clatter were itself truth; they see
clouds above which presage disintegra
tion of old political organizations and
the solidifying of discontented ele
ments into one great, moral body, the
reform movement now so rapidly gain
ing strength in all parts of the country.
Dying! Oh, yes; dying with a ven
geance. The more we die the stronger
we become. Dying! During the past
three weeks sixty-four new reform
papers have reached the exchange ta
ble of the Nonconformist; and this is
only about one-fourth of the newspa
pers which have been ushered into exist
ence in that length of time to preach
the new political gospel. Dying! Texas
alone has seventy-five people's party
papers, more than either of the twins
have in indiana. Kansas has more
than one hlundred.as also has Nebraska,
while in Minnesota and other north
western states these "new lights" are
springing up like mushrooms during
night time; and Indiana now boasts of
nearly fifty. Dying! And 3,000 news
papers chant the funeral dirge! Ye
gods! How pleasant to die in such a
manner. How the corrupt twins would
like to enjoy such a death! Dying! In
1896 this young political giant will have
15,000 organs to float sweet strains of
music-at the funeral of one of the old
liberty-destroying parties. Dyingl
Why. the allied parties of fraud and
corruption are trembling in their old
wornout boots, fearful lest the new
movement will carry additional states
and gain control of the congressional
delegation on election day. Dyingl
Make the fur fly, boys; let's keep
a-dyin'.-Nonconformist.
Contrasted Policies.
The old party leaders know that if
either of them continue in power
financial conditions will inevitably re
main the same. They know, too, that
if financial conditions continue as now,
the people cannot and will not much
longer stand it. That this is known in
the higher walksof political life, is evi
denced by the concentration of the
military forces at the labor centers.
So the real policy is to keep labor's
nose to the grindstone, and force sub.
mission by the bayonet. The policy of
the people's party, on the contrary, is
one of peace. It does not invoke the
aid of standing armies. It demands "a
national currency, safe, sound and
fexible, issued by the general govern
ment only, a full legal tender for all
debts, public and private," and that
-will employ labor, and settle the strike
and riot question. Those who, for
selfish purposes, compel a continuation
I of present conditions, must be held re
sponsible for what follows as a result
Sthereo--Progressive Farmer.
A Crsis Is Comlsg.
Any man of intelligence who will give
Sclose and careful attention to the con
ditions existing in every enlightened
Snation, must admit that a crisis is ap
proaching that is without a parallel in
the world's history. The fires of dis
content are burning on both conti
nents- The old and rotten monarchies
of Europe are, as it were, resting upon
volcanoes. They are honey-combed
with secret societies whose object is
the overthrow of oppressive ancient
systems and the establishment of
others more consistent with modern en
lightenment and progres. The spirit
1of individual liberty,which has so long
sleptis again awakened. Industry de
Smands a just share in the values it
creates. Every day the discontent in
reases What is to be the result?
There is need of all our intelligence,
all our sagacity, all our patriotism, and
all our conservatism to so direct events
as to bring the least evil when the final
erash shall 0ome.-National Watleh
