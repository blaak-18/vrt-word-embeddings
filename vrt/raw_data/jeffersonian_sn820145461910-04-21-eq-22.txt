WHAT’S BECOME OF THE LIBE
RIA COMMISSION?
Dear Sir: —I am a subscriber to
both weekly and monthly Jeffs.
Can’t well do without them.
But, look here, Mr. Watson, I beg
your pardon, but did you ever get a
report of the commission that was
sent to Liberia to look after that
“cullud” republic? You promised to
publish it, and if you ever have I
have failed to see it. I think it
would be interesting reading.
MARTIN NEWLIN.
West York Lee, Ga.
P. S. —Since writing the above I
have received a copy of the “Wo
man’s National Daily’’, from which
I send clippings. There are papers
all over the United States that will
publish such items, but never a
comment —but you are not that
kind. M. N.
Comment.
The Commission has reported. We
are asked to become Guardian and
Wet-nurse to Liberia. Taft has so
recommended in a special Message to
Congress. Speak to your Congress
man, and pledge him against it.
We’ve got coons enough, already.

A FEW POINTERS ON RECENT
TARIFF BILLS.
Dear Sir: —Enclosed find one dol
lar for the weekly. Will you please
answer the following questions in the
weekly at your earliest convenience:
1. Should United States Senators
be elected by a direct vote of the peo
ple?
2. What influence put it in the
Constitution to elect by the State
Legislatures?
3. Give a few instances in which
the United States Senate defeated
important legislation favorable to
the people.
4. Discuss the personnel of the
United States Senate.
5. What proportion of the Sena
tors is connected with corporate in
terest? Any other information in
regard to this question will be great
ly appreciated.
I was one of the two boys, the oth
er one being six years younger than
myself, from Alabama in the 1908
St. Louis convention.
I am to take part in the con
test debate between the tw’O socie
ties of the county high school. Our
society is named after Robert E.
Lee, the other one is named after
three of the Democrats of the town
here. Os course, I know that you
can’t do everybody’s debating, but I
thought, as this is a national ques
tion, that you might give an edito
rial. If you can do so I will be glad;
if its not convenient, all right, and
may you live long to continue in the
great work that you are doing.
Yours very respectfully,
Moulton, Ala. J. D. L. BYARS.
Answer.
(1) Yes.
(2) The same that made the whole
instrument so undemocratic.
(3) When the Wilson tariff bill
was Gormaniz-ed by 1,100 Senatorial
amendments which absolutely revo
lutionized it. In those amendments,
the Sugar Trust and other greedy
corporations got what they wanted.
When the Anti-Option bill, which
the House passed, was killed by the
Senate.
When the Payne tariff bill (which
was abominable) was made very
much worse in the Senate.
(4) That would require a great
deal more space than we can afford
to give the subject.
(5) With a few honorable excep
tions, they all are.
If you would write to your Con-
gressman, you might get a copy of
the Congressional Directory, which
tells of the personnel of Senators and
Representatives.
This is election year, and the men
who want it some more are very ac
commodating.
AS TO BOND ISSUES.
Dear Sir: —Please allow me space
in your columns to again call your
readers’ attention to the schemes of
the money power. President Taft, in
his special message to Congress, has
recommended the issuance of $30,-
0 00,000 more of bonds for reclama
tion purposes, and says that if it be
necessary that he will recommend
the issuance of bonds to construct
dams in the Ohio river. Now, the
question is this: why should our law
makers heap debt on the nation by
issuing more .bonds, when they could
and should issue legal tender paper
money? If the bonds are good, based
on the credit of the nation, the
money would be good with the same
security. It was good under Van
Buren’s administration; it was good
under Lincoln’s administration, and
would be good under any other ad
ministration; but the money power
wants more bonds issued so they can
invest their idle money, bank cur
rency instead of legal tender money,
so that they can control it. The peo
ple need plenty of legal tender gov
ernment money, paid into circulation
through Government expenses. If
not put in circulation fast enough
that way, loan to the people through
the States. The issuing of bonds by
a nation is a crime, and ought to be
prohibited. F. S. TAYLOR,
Vice-Pres. U. S. Monetary League.
Rt. 1, Walnut Springs, Texas.
BELIEVES IN THE JEFFS AND
PROTECTIVE TARIFF.
Dear Sir:—l wish your paper was
in every home in the United States.
When I get mine I never quit till
I read everything in it.
I want to say you have got me on
the mourner’s bench on the tariff
question. I have thought that a pro
tective tariff was best for our coun
try, but this Payne-Aldrich law is
about to give me a bellyfull of high
tariff, and I think there are a great
many others in about the same fix.
Mr. Watson, how could you be op
posed to the rural carriers getting a
raise, when it costs so much to live
now? (I never was.—T. E. W.)
You certainly did go after that fel
low Howard about right. Wonder if
he is any akin to M. W. Howard from
our district, the 7th of Alabama. I
ink he (M. W. Howard) is going
to make the race this time against
John L. Burnett as an Independent.
The Republicans of several counties
have endorsed him, so if he runs
they will not put out a man.
I will quit before I worry you too
much. A FRIEND.
P. S. —I would like to know what
Mr. Roosevelt’s religion is. Have
heard he was Methodist. I don’t
want to vote for a man for Presi
dent who is too thick with the Ro
man Catholics—l won’t do it if I
know it.
(Teddy belongs to the Dutch Re
formed Church, but he is not famous
for piety.—T. E. W.)
THE JEFFS ARE DOING GOOD
WORK.
Dear Sir: —As I sit in my country
home, I wish to extend to you my
sincere and heartfelt congratulations
on the success you have made with
your pen, through the medium of the
two Jeffersonians, in extending the
true principles of our great reforma
tion. With best wishes to you and
family and all co-workers,
I am, as ever, yours sincerely,

IS INTERESTED IN RESURREC
TION OF WATSON.
bear Sir:—Your Magazine comes
to my house every month and The
Jeffersonian every week, notwith
standing other interesting reading
matter, but on their arrival all are
laid aside until I get through with
them.
On the eighth page of The Jeffer
sonian of this week’s issue, “Read
This and Tell Six Others,” etc., I
was especially interested, refreshing
my memory of our political wrangles
in the tenth district, and especially
in Augusta, where they thought to
have buried Thos. E. Watson; ignor
ant of the fact that it was only a
preparation for a more noble resur
rection.
And grateful am I to have lived
to see his form and noble spirit on
the top round of the ladder in both
the “political and Foreign Mission
world,” while many of his opponents
have died in both Church and State,
and scores of others dying and in the
last throes of death, to be no more.
I have six sons and one son-in
law in business in this county (Bul
loch) and two sons of my last wife,
Thos. E. W. and David, and you may
depend upon the whole push as strong
advocates of the cause and princi
ples you have espoused the many
years we have known you, and all are
readers after you.
Our children are all in this county,
and it has been an annual custom
with them to celebrate my birthday,
which next, if I live to see it, seventy
—2Bth of June.
At our last we had with us our
friend, Rev. J. J. Pennington, who
spent the week visiting and preach
ing around for us; hope he will turn
up again. God bless you and the
cause for which you are fighting.

A LETTER FROM FLOYD COUNTY.
Dear Sir: —As I have read nothing
in your paper from old Floyd county,
1 will write a few lines to let you
know that we are all for you, will
agree with you on all of your work,
but some of the people don’t fully
understand your stand on Missions.
Some think you are working against
Foreign Missions, and some say you
don’t believe in mission work at all.
If you don’t, I don’t understand why
you are working for the Sunny South
Brotherhood, when that is just a
home mission work. lam just with
you on the Foreign Mission line; I
don’t believe in it at all. Yet I have
been a member of the Missionary So
ciety, but since I took your Jeffer
sonian and read what I have I cut it
all out. I wish everybody in the
world could read your paper; if they
would the world would fare better.
The people don’t know what is go
ing on in the world till they read
your Jeffersonian. I wish I could do
something to help you in your hard
battle, but I don’t think you need
any help at all, for you hit them on
every side and twice in the middle. I
hope you will print a piece in your
Jeffersonian of what you fully believe
in the missionary line, so the people
will understand it more fully. lam
just with you on the S. S. B. line; I
am willing to do, and will do, every-

thing I can for the poor, afflicted peo
ple that are not able to help them
selves. I don’t know of any invalids
in our county, but I will do all I can
for any I can hear of. So I will close,
wishing you a long and a happy life
that you can live and do more for the
people.
Yours for the S. S. 8.,

PRIMITIVE BAPTIST
Martin, Tenn.
“I had a curiosity to see
whether the Primitive Baptist
was as unfair, hide-bound, ar
rogant and abusive as the pa
pers run by missionary fa
natics. . . . To my agreeable
surprise I found that the
whole build and spirit of the
paper was up to my ideal of a
Christian paper. ... In choos
ing your religious reading,
you might give the Primitive
Baptist a trial, even though
you are not of that faith and
order. You’ll get some really
religious literature, if you
do.”—Thos. E. Watson in The
Jeffersonian of February 17,
1910.
