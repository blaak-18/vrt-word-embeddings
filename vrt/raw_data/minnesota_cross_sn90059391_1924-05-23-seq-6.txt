Time To Think
By REV. E. T. ALDRICH
Pastor, Saint Andrew’s United
Brethren Church, Des Moines
I have on my desk a little magazine
published in New York city that
la strictly a business magazine. Many
firms in America present a copy of
It every month to each of their em
ployees. The one I have came from a
Jew firm. I speak of this because I
want you to see that other people be
sides the Ku klux Klan are alarmed
about some conditions in America.
No one could claim the following
statement a biased opinion.
Under the title “Makes the Blood
Boil,” a magazine called The Silent
Partner has this to say:
"There is a city of 60,000 inhabit
ants within the city limits of Detroit
and it is called Hamtramck. The
Residents recently held a mass meet
teg and demanded ‘Polish rule,’ voted
‘evacuation of the state police,’ de
clared themselves for ‘the removal
of all but Polish people from the
community/
“Two prominent judges attempting
to speak in English in defense of the
federal court and federal laws, were
booed into silence and told that only
the Polish tongue should be heard.
'This is enough to make an Ameri
can’s blood boil, and a thinking man’s
blood run cold.”
And so think we all. May the
American people wake up to the
alarming conditions facing us at this
very present.

NEW ALASKA ROUTE
Flyer, Lost in Arctic Dark
ness Cuts Time 16 Days
Washington.—Lost In an airplane In
the stygian darkness of an Aiaskan
night, without a star above or a light
below to guide him, was the experi
ence of Carl B. Kietson, air mall pilot,
on hia first trip over an experimental
route between Fairbanks and Mc-
Grath. Alaska, according te his report
received recently by Postmaster Gen
eral New,
So Interesting was the report of
Elelson's adventure that the postmas
ter general read It at cabinet meeting
and President Coolldge wrote s per
sonal letter to the air mall pilot con
gratulating him. Accompanying this
letter went a similar one from Mr.
New.
T congratulate you on the conspicu
ous success of your undertaking,” the
President said. “Your experience pro
vides a unique and interesting ehgptw
In the rapidly developing science of
aerial navigation.”
Elrlson made the first leg of his trip
from Fairbanks to McGrath without
mishap. He began the return trip at
2:35 p. m.
“I expected,” Kielsoa said In his re
port, "to get home by 5:10 p. m„ at
dusk. In one hour and fifteen minutes
later I reached Lake Mlnchumlnu,
which Is nearly half way. Later 1
passed over a stream which was not
on the map and I thought It must be
the Kautishua river. Still later I
reached this stream, but thought It was
the Tunana river.
‘To the left I saw a bluff which
looked like the Ncnana bluff. I struck
for the bluff and everything was all
right except that the town of Nenana
was not In Its place. By this time It
was pitch dark. I could not believe
that I had got 50 mllos off my course
after the same compass coarse had
brought me half way exactly on the
course. I left the river, going east
T wandered around oompletely lost
for most of an hour. I went back to
the big river and, while following It,
saw a flare In the distance. ! hit for It
and U turned out te be my home field.
There was • light In front of the
hangar."
Among the tetter* brought from Mc-
Grath by Elelson was one addressed
to Paul Henderson, second assistant
postmaster general. This letter ar
rived In Washington 16 days earlier
than It could have had the first stage
of its Journey been made by dog team.

I, JacewMah's Solamn Warning to
juuan (w. 1-7).
The Lord commanded him to stand
In a conspicuous place In the Temple
and proclaim the judgment which was
about to fall upon them because of
their sins. The object was to provoke
them to repentance (v. 3). If they
would not repent, God would make
the Temple as Shiloh (v. 6). Just as
Slilloli was once the dwelling place
of the Lord and now fallen Into decay
and abandoned, so wiil it be with the
Temple. Jeremiah was sent to speak
the words which the Lord had told
him and not to diminish a word.
11. Jeremiah on Trial (vv. 8-11).
1. Cause of Arrest (v. 8). It was
for faithfully speaking all the Lord
had commanded The one who speaks
boldly what God commands shall he
opposed. The time-server and self
seeker will not stand for such a min
istry- The Isaiahs and Jeremiahs
must suffer.
2. The Charge (vv. S, 9). It was a
capital crime. They said, “Thou shalt
surely die.” His guilt according to
their charge was twofold: (1) Pre
tending to speak for God; (2) Speak
ing agAlnst the temple and the city.
According to their charge he was
guilty of blasphemy and sacrilege.
The ewe who prophesied without
Gad's command was to be punished
by death (Deut. 18:20). Blasphemy
was also punished by death (Lev.
24:16). Both Jesus and Stephen were
accused of blespuemy.
3. The Princes Sit In Judgment (w.
10,11). When the excitement reached
the ears of the princes they came to
Judge of the merits of the case. Mat
ters of state were not entirely In the
hands of the priests and elders, but
were partly controlled by members of
the royal family.
111. Jeremiah’s Defense (vv. 12-15).
Threats of death did not deter him
from preaching, but only made him re
peat his message.
1. Reiterates His Divine Commis
sion (v. 12). He had nothing to deny,
but to repeat what he had said. He
plainly told them that In opposing him
they were opposing God, for he waa
God’s messenger.
2. His Exhortation (v. 13)< He
urged them to amend their ways and
obey God, and God would not bring
upon them Judgment.
8. He Gave Himself Up (v. 14). Ha
did not resist the powers of govern
ment (Rom. 13:1). Knowing that he
was sent of God he was content to
trust God for deliverance.
4. Warns of Fatal Consequence (v.
15). He frankly told them that God had
aeot him, and if they killed him they
would be guilty of defying God. Woe
would not only fall upon them, but
the nation and city would suffer.
IV. Jeramiah Saved (vv. 16-24).
He wus acquitted. God Is able to
raise up friends and advocates from
the ranks of those who oppose u*.
1. Judgment of the Princes (v. 16).
They pronounced him not guilty, as he
had spoken in the name of the Lord.
Jeremiah’s words convinced them that
he was speaking the truth.
t Speech ef the Elders (vv. 17-23).
Ah fl»e princes probably represented
the king, so the elders represented the
people. The elders pleaded for Jere
miah and adduced several eases in
Illustration:
(1) Mlcah (vv. 18. 19). Mlcah had
prophesied against Jerusalem, hut King
Hezeklah Instead of putting him to
death, repented and thus turned aside
the punishment which wa» Impending.
(2) Urijah (vv. 20-231. Vrijah
prophesied against the city and land
and thus Incurred the wrath of
Jehotakim, who even brought him back
from Egypt whence he had fled and
slew him.
Though all this was done. Judgment
was not thus thwarted. Killing God’s
prophets does not prevent God’s Jmlg
ment, but Intensifies It. In the case
of Hezeklah God’s Judgments were
turned aside through heeding the words
of the prophet, and in the case of
Jeholaklm Judgment fell upon the na
tion because of refusal and maltreat
ment of the prophet.
3. Rescued by Ahikam (v. 24). Ahl
kam must have been a man of Influence
to be able to interfere at such a time.

Boy Scout, Selling
Klan Newspaper, is
Hard Lad to Bluff
MASON CITY IA., May 17.—A local
Boy Scout, dressed in the uniform of
his organization, was selling The lowa
Fiery Cross on downtown street#
here last Saturday.
Scoutmaster ’1 nomas seeing him
informed hint that he had better not
sell the Klan paper as he didn’t want
any sectarianism brought into the or*
ganization. The scoutmaster mad#
the statement that The lowa Fiery
Cross was an anti-Catholic paper.
The Seoul., nowever, continued tor
sell his papers. Finally the lad’#
mother was called up, but learning
that there was no provision in the
Boy Scouts’ constitution and by-law#
which prohibited them from selling
the Klan paper she allowed her sotr
to go on with his sales.
The sectarian cry Is all against the
Klan paper. When a Roman Catholic
clergyman talked from the Scout
truck in the boys’ week parade a few
weeks ago, Scoutmaster Thomas had
nothing to say about sectarianism be~
ing injected into his organization.
