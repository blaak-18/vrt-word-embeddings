S Of the causeq for this threatened
79 "'exouse" the DI) MnRAT (can fnod
- none, as the eleotlo wVe peaceful,
quiet and lawful; nor has there
bhen a sloale outbreak or collision
between the races duriag the year
'ers anywhere throughout the State. tbe
PER Constitution guarantees them all
that they might ask and the prom
E. lees of the white people are as liberal
m as eould be expectesl.
lk. Yet the exodsus in threatened.
&ad And the DEMOCRAT very wisely
says:
There is but one comment, consistent
with dignity andl wisdom, to be made
upon Ihis situation, and that is to say
8th that, if the colored people are dissatis.
fled and wish to adventure in new fields,
they had better go in peace oand prompt
ly. We shall regret it. We shall be
trg- sorry to see the relations of so many
ov. years distunrhbedl and, in onr conservatism,
we shall lind it diflicult and unwelcome
to accommodate ourselves to a new or.
der of things and to set about arranging
bat the problem ofour prosperity under new
of conditions and starting from unacns
tomed premises. Nevertheless, if the neo.
S ros want to go, let them go. We 'san.
not possibly gain anything worth having
by keeping them againsttheWr will, and
is we may gain much by beginning afresh
upon an entirely clean slate.
Such has been our views all along.
'a That temporary ills will follow the
his wholesale emigration of the colored
laborer we do not doubt, yet even
these ills can In a great measure be
ter mllttated: and as the DamockP
he wisely ays, "wermay gain much by,
he beginrlng afresh." Ceftafnly we
cal overcome the want of labor In
the putting In and the cultivation of
our cotton and core crops. Thanks
in to the longenuity of man, machinery
Is superceeding manuel labor even In
al our fields. Nor is there any doubt I
)n of the practiblilty of the machinery,
such as the sulky plow, the cotton I
chopper, the corn planter, and the
a spiky ultivator for both core and
cotton. Even this year Major Broad.
ol. well, one of our moseet practieal and
1 smeedesfual planters, lnforms as that 4
he has tested the sulky cultivator In
.sl cotton to his entire satileactlon.' He I
worked one, with an Englisbhman,
and tbilq 1 firt season l Louisiana, '
let who cultivated forty-five acres of
cotton from. which was ploked over
fifty bales. Of oourse the one laan
ooild never pick his crop but that is
a small matter, for we could get
thousands of laborers to do that
work.
Evidently the battle as it Is now
