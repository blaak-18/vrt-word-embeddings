she was going in
for literature there
)r were those among
e us who scoffed.

girls with arllring faces-the sort of

c° Suddenly she wearied of the endless
Ad round of gayety and fashion to which
a from her teens she had been ac
as customed, and amazed her coterie by
or declaring her intention of writing re
alistic novels. Of course, every one
said it was merely a fad and would soon
blow over. But it didn't, that was the
ns astounding part of it.
e. Her first novel attracted more than
be passing notice. She was commended
ýg for her original and audacious style,
e- her clever plot and a certain dainty
x- feminine touch. She was written

st From being merely a typical society

and thought of nothing but her miser
able ambitfon.
Local oloring came to.be an absolute
mania with her. She was always prat
tling of "atmosphere" and "realism."
One can stand a lot of infernal non
sense from a pretty woman, but really
poor Violet often grew actually tire
some with her endless rhapsodies about
"the divinity of realism."
It was Just after publishing her sec
ond novel, a combination of ingenuity
and wickedness, a smartish, brackish
story you wouldn't have liked your sis.
ter to write, that the girl decided to go
to the far west in search of "local col
or" for her next attempt.
"res," she drawled, with the fine
lady air of disdain she had assumed
since her success, "yes, I am going in
search of local color and a hero. I may
take a cowboy for the latter - who
knows? They tell me those fellows are
delightfully original and as breezy as
the winds from the Rockies."
She made up her mind she had not
been misinformed when a month later
she met Jack Weatherby.
Weatherby was a child of the plains.
He had never been east of the Missis
sippi and had an infinite contempt for
the land of the rising san. He had
hunted for a living; he had been a cow
boy, and raised as much of a rumpus
in mining camps as the next fellow.
Now he owned his own ranch and herds;
had settled down somewhat, and had
begun to think he would like a wife
and home.
We was a handsome fellow, as fiery
as the mustang he rode, and as tender
hearted as a woman-some women.
His ranch lay In the shadow of the
Sangre do Christo range, next to that
of the Athertoms, whe the New York
girl wa stseping. Its acres stretched
to the sbadowy Hat hills and over
them seUme the sle*, well-ed crest
arm et whih he wap as prod.
It was two ays aftnr her arival that

crony, and had come down the rall
with his customary "Hark" and
"Whoop." As though riding the sight
less couriers of the air, he dashed up
I to the little flower garden, spurs and
I chains jingling, sombrero flapping, an('
a letting out a yell which could navle been
r heard in Denver. And there by the
side of pretty Mrs. Atherton' sat a
stranger, a vision, an angel! The as
s tonished ranchman blushed and stam
r mered like a schoolboy as he bowed
- awkwardly and apologized for his
3 Apache-like descent.
Who is this divinity in palest pink,
this radiant creature with hair like
3 gold and eyes of heaven's own blue'
r "My friend, Miss Lingard, from New
York," Mrs. Atherton said.
1 Pshaw! She was a celestial being
straight from Paradise.
I have always pitied Weatherby.
Never for one moment could I blame
1 him. He was a primitive man with
savage instincts lurking in his breast.
3 Brave, loyal, straight-forward himself,
1 how could he dream of the treacherous
cruel blows one little soft white hand
was capable of dealing?
Violet found this sturdy, brawny
ranchero a delightful study, and de
1 cided he should be the hero of her next
novel. His quaint wit and poetic fan
cies born of the mesas and mountains.
1 his forcible and often ungrammatical
I speech were faithfully noted; his emo
tions were played upon, his heart was
probed. And he neler dreamed he was
i being experimented on. He loved this
exquisite creature, this dainty, soft,
purring beauty, as he loved his life.
He coveted her and longed to shut her
close to his big, faithful, honest heart.
At last came the night when Violet
I carried her passion for "atmosphere"
and "local coloring" to its climax. They
t had gone for their customary evening
stroll, and had climbed up a lofty
1 butte to a broad ledge of rocks. At
I their feet yawned the canon, tremen
dous, awful, black, save where the
moonlight touched the opposite wall
with ghostly fingers. Back of them
r- loomed the range like the battlements
of a phantom city. While far, far be
to low sounded the faint rushing of water
t- -the river tumbling and foaming along
over its rocky bed.
1- "What a weird place," cried Violet, .
ly with a pretty shudder, "and what a
e- ghost-like night. Why did we never
it come up here before, Jack? What a
scene!"
c- Weatherby was lying at her feet
.y where he had thrown himself to rest r
h after their climb. b
I- He turned his face, white in the
;o moonlight, toward her, and fixing his t
I- dusky, unfathomable eyes upon her, a
said: n
oe "I kept this place for this hour. I o
4 meant to bring you here when I got s
n my courage to the point where I could
y say all that is in my heart. Many a
o time down there," pointing to the
,e ranch lying below, "I have looked up
j here and thought of the time I would
bring you to tell you how I love you." P
t For one instant Violet felt a queer
r little thrill. The simple dignity of his
declaration almost moved the worldly, a
s. cold-blooded girl. Then she thought of e
- her local coloring.
r "Whit a situation for my novel," she a
d said to herself; then aloud, gently: ti
"So you really love me, Jack?" L
a "Love your' he echoed passionately,
!. as he roe and sat down beside her,
I I"Violet, look," taking her hand, "my
I heart lies here in this dear little hand." a
a Then throwing all reserve to the a
winds, he seized her and kissed her a
T madly, tempestuously. ' n
r She strnggled to free herself and at 1
length sueceeded.
s "How dare you?" she demanded, 0
t "how dare-"
t "How dare I?" he cried. "Why, dear- b
I est, I love yea-I love you, do you hear? b
r And you, you love me a little, do you d
not!"
He was approaching her again, whea kI
t she said eontemptuoasly: a
r "No, not a bit. I have simply been t
r studying ye." T
tr oiustod i t e ostearoe,.
II "Studying me," be said. in a queer
63 voice, "studying-why-why?" he say
it- agely demanded, as he caught her
IP wrist and held it it an iron grip.
1d "You were so different," she faltered,
r' :i bit frightened by his sudden ferocity.
en "I wanted a new type for my book, you
be I know. I suppose Tom told you I write
a books-"
S- An absolute murderous look swept
n- over Weatherby's face.
ed "No," he said. "no one told me that.
is So you write books? And you wanted
to put me in it--was that it? Answer
k, me, answer me."
ke "Yes." she murmured, faintly.
"And that was all? You never loved
w me--never meant to marry me?"
"Why no, how could I? I am to be
Ig married in the fall to a man in New
York--"
v. A snarl like that of an infuriated
ne beast interrupted her. Livid with
th rage he sprang toward her. Once again
it. he crushed her, shrinking and trem
If, bling, to his breast, then dragged her
us to the very edge of the canon, gaping
ad like the bottomless pit to receive them.
And as her agonized screams pierced
v the soft summer night, Weatherby, still
_ holding her against his outraged heart,
xt stepped off.
i- They found them next day in the
s, bottom of the canon. Violet's lovely
al face was past recognition, but on
- Weatherby's lingered a smile of such
o
as awful triumph as would have pleased
as the arhfiend himself.-From Truth.

It, PRAYING ON THE SIDEWALK.
et Tn Barclav Street Devout Catholic
t Kneel Before Images.
In Barclay street are several stores
that display images of Christ, the vir
gin and other Roman Catholic emblems.
A bare-headed old man stood on the
sidewalk the other day and gazed rev
t erently at a large statue of the virgin.
After a time he repeated, in a low tone,
several prayers. His devotions lasted
about five minutes, and then, after
blessing himself, he walked slowly
away.
"That old man has been coming here
every day for about two years," said a
truckman, whose stand was near by.
"Almost at the stroke of five he shows
up and prays for several minutes."
"He's not the only one," the truck
man continued. "Several others, most
ly women, come to this block in the
early morning, and even get on their
knees outside the windows where
images are shown. From their looks I
should think many of them are Ital
lans."-N. Y. Press.
She Was Dressed Like a Man.
Dr. George M. Bassett, of Vandalla,
Ill., and Miss Allen Bumgardner, alias
Mattle Murphy, alias Mattie Howe, of
Hillsboro, Ill., were arrested in St.
Louis the other night, because the girl
was masquerading in the attire of a
young man. At the police station both
declared their masculinity. The ef
feminate looking one was taken to the
city dispensary, where the wise doctors
soon discovered that the prisoner was
a sure-enough woman.
"This is simply a spree, and I ac
knowledge the corn," said Dr. Bassett.
"When I get out of here I shall go home
to-my family. I have two pretty little
children, 4 and 6 lears old, respectively,
and I love them dearly. While I cannot
get along very well with my wife, yet
I never dreamed of eloping with the
young woman who is with me."
Bodily Health.
The man or woman, says Dr. Ward
Howe, who trains himself or herself in
the best bodily health makes the best
of life. Bodily welfare is important,
not for itself only, but because the
health of the mind so largely depends
on the health of the body. A good en
gine outlives many of its masters be
cause they attel to it more carefully
than they azfa to their own bodies.
SThe usual relations of the age of ma
turity to length of life, Indicating a
ratio of one to five, suggests that a man
taking twenty-one years to mature
should live 105 years. The fact that
such life is exceptionally attained
shows its possibility and it is owing to
a errors that it is not more widely at
r tained in the human species.
