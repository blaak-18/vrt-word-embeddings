A SHIRT WAIST FIGURE.
 ew to Ieee.asslly Pat oa the P.,.
alar /e ssoa
The femiine m turns to the
question of shirt d' ashlon
givres its opinion be
makes the shirt waist so popu
lar? As simple looking as it is a shirt
waist takes as much time to put on
properly as an evening dress. For
there are ways and ways of putting on
a shirt waist. A woman ne'er looks so
trimly dressed, so altogetbhr "chipper,"
as she does in a shirt wast that is well
put on or so slouchy as In one that is
badly put on.
For the sake of4bhose dear women
who for lack of k6owledge or inspira
tion Have never arned to do the thing
properly one of/be shirt waist wearers
gives a few rles which itf followed to
the letter will guarantee a "shirt waist
figure" to those who have dreamed of
one, but have heretofore had no person
al acquaintance with it.
_irst, then, take the corset you are
wearing a straight front, of course, for
they Can be bought now in the cheaper
models as well as the most expensive,
and just at the end of the eyelets at the
bottom of the corset sew a loop of inch
wide ribbon es either side.
Now put on your shirt waist, fasten
ing it with the tiny pearl buttons which
are to be so fashionable this summe,
and tie your stock, taking care to lap it
neatly in the baek.
Then, with two small safety pins, pin
ebelt of your shirt waist at the back
_ the roops of ribbon as tight as you
tan stand it without being uancomforta
ble or making yourself feel like a horse
with too tight a checkrein.
Now take your hand mirror and turn
around and look at oaur back. Did you
ever get quite that fat edect before?
Did your shirt waist ever fit so smooth
y between the shoulders? For my own
waists I alwars have the belt sewed
down Jost to the side seams and then
hangi:.r tree so that I may plait the
front .t the Waist to suit myself.
Smooth the waist down weu then an
ter the arms and ever the hips and pin
it on each side. Then plait the fullness
left Into side plaits and if you are thin
enough to stand It blouse it a little in
front
Now fasten the loose ends of your
belt, and there you are, I warrant you,
with a better shirt waist figure then
you ever dreamed could be yours

Cape Town, June 26.-Details of the
engagement between General Elliott'l
column and DeWet's force near Reitn
on June 6 show the British surprised

seeing that their captors were not In
strong force, the Boers returned and
charged with great determination and
after desperate fighting recaptured the
convoy. Meanwhile Colonel Delisle ar
rived with reinforcements and fighting
was renewed. The Boers lay beneath
their wagons and fired volleys between
the, wheels, while their comrades en
gaged in spanning and driving off that
portion of the convoy furtherest from
the British. The latter pushed in among
the wagons using their bayonets freely.
General Delarey was present and per
sonally used a rifle. A man at his right
was killed and a comrade on his left
hand was wounded. The affair ended
in hand to hand encounters and fierce
melees, the Boers eventually being driv
en off. One of General DeWet's staff
ofloers was wounded and captured.
