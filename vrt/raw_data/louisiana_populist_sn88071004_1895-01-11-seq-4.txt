A Lucid Explanation of the
Bond Scheme.
Once upon a time, an inventive
genius constructed what he called a
a "Hen Persuader." It was sima
ply an ordinary nest with a hole in a
drop through ito a receiver be
low.
As she arose to cackle, she di.a
covered that there was no egg in
the next, so she would go back h
and lay another, with the same re.
sult, and kept it up until at last t
she laid herself to death, or prac.
tically so, for there was nothing t
left of her but a few feathers and
eonce. The old parties have con
struted a financial nest, called a
"Gol Persuader." Uncle Sam b
gets on and hands Wall Street a h
5_,S000,000 bond, and Wall 8taeet
cackles, and Uncle Sam Is at once e
enabled to lay a *50,O00,O00 golden *
egg, which drops through the hole
in the bottom of the nest, and re
deems ,50,OO,000 of W.l Street's a
