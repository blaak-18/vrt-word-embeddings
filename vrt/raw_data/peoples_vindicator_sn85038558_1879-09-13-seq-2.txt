ICome New!
Our esteemed contemporary the De
Soto DEmOCRAT, we are quite sure
was In one of its petulent bhumors
when It evoluted the following fabu.
Ions assertlnna:
Editor. " " * *
Whether the NEw Constitution 1i
S1i9. adopted or not. is of no consequence.
for the old is about as good as the
new one.
nl The DsxocrT is not treating its
by at readers tirly nor discussing the sub
rlen. jeot of the NEW CoIarrrTIrox with
that candor for which It is anted. It
has not pubolhed nor furnished to 4
its traders the Constitution that they I
STo might se, read and judge for them. 4
Mdise selves; It has not pointed a single I
lows: argument or an Iota of reason agIainst
L . the new Constitution, but has per. c
sistently and dogmatically denouno- I
Lras. ed It in the quoted manner.
prM. Now, the DEmoc AT has not a sin- t
until gle fact to sustain so sweeping a f
charge as that which we produce c
from its last Issue. Ii
Is the saving annually to the peo- t
tlon ple of $1,009,600 In the saw, not bet. a
ter than the oLn?
Is not a reduction of taxation ina
d to the usw of six mills from eleven and I
one-half mills in the oLD, something
better9 It
h Is not the destruction of monopo. a
lies, the abrogation and reduction of ti
fees In oftice, and the reducing of ti
bthe number of oiclaials by the Naw p
a CoNsrrrtIoxN, better than the oLD, tU
whihob fostered the oneand sustained pi
the others ?
as It is true that there are some pro. a
me rislone in the xxw not as we would tb
aob wish them, but they are not of such r,
moment as would make us reject a tb
fundamental iaw, the handwork of st
h our own race and party, and throw ed
e ourselves headlong Into the support th
Red of a Constitution born of fraud and a
er Ignorance.
The talk of Warmoth "out gener
mt lin" any ody In the Convention Is at
o the slliest of twaddle. Warmoth w
has been a bug-bear 13ng enough, lit
and we are of the opinion he got e
out of the Convention worse batter. i
LE ad than his adversaries. t
lad If the Oonsttution just framed and p
se about to be submltted is to be resist so
on. ed and dofeated by Democrats, let us fol
reason the cause for it Let our
esteemed contemporary, the Dino.
nrr state its objections plainly, and
~perhaps we may be shown why we sh1
should not favor the Constitution tw
a oursell We never aake any one's th
assertions; he must prove his de- dos
We may yet have he Coastitutona La

SIt is important from the fact that dl
d it shows the animus of the Grant t

"If," says General Garfield, "they A
(the Democrat.) show a determined tI

nominated."

That this answer is true, we have ito
i but to cite General Garfield; he by
says: "But should the electioNs this fall
be strongly in favor of the Republl

In other words, the whole talk proves Mi
conolusively that Garfield means to no

No amount of sophistry can ex
