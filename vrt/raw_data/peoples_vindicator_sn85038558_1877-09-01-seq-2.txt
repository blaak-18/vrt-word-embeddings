What has caused the difliculty of i
navigatiion iu lid Rl ivei of late Tanil ' of

i ty-live years ago the Fails at Alexan. fog

gation would lie greatly impioved. cc
SIt was cldonle, and what was the re- s
t, suilt! The first year afterwards navi- se
hI gation was ell i'elyjsuispeºilid for near- c
o ly live months; and the 're'ason wwas t
\ very plain. Thie Falls acted as a at

The Corn Crop.
bs Notwithstanding thie loss of cotton
sustained by manuy fromnt the early de
predation of the caterpillar this year, a
we are of the opinion our farmers t
have reason to congratulate them
selves upon the certainty of a slargoe .
et and ampille corn crop.
eu For a inumnber of yeats our granary
in has been thie WVest and the small
Spri rofits from short cotton crops were
rk swallowed ip ini the lipurchluise of crll )
anld meat. Tllis year wroe will not be (
Isconilpelled to "go Iw'est" ftl bread. On
the conitrary, we will IhaveO an abun
lhe dance for all purp,es- not only for (
on 'r bread bilt with which to fatten C
ICe soitme i ieat. VWhat Ilolley is maide
tor fiom the cotton crop of thie iarish
- this year will be expended in imipro
ior ving and developing farins and not (
nd in the lpurchase of corn from the r
SWestern States. e
Ifour farmers would only fatten I
25 per cent of their meat this year s
L1 that much would he saved. We hiope
tt' they will do so, for we contend that I
ri- witlh plenty of meat and corn in the
eor coantry we can stand the caterpillar t
he amazinglhy well.
