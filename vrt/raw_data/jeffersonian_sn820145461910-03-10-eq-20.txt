All readers of the Jeffersonian who
have sick friends, suffering from rheu
matism or kidney trouble, will be In
terested;
FINDS NEW KIDNEY CURE
Dr. T. Frank Lynott, New York Specialist,
Discovers Remarkable Remedy.
At last a perfectly harmless and positive
cure appears to have been found. Dr. T.
Frank Lynott, formerly of the New York
University, New York, later of the fa
mous Bellevue Hospital, and now a cele
brated specialist in Chicago, has a very
quick-acting formula which has been ap
proved by the best doctors.
The editor of the Jeffersonian saw the
above clipping from the Inter Ocean and
wanted to know of this new formula for
curing kidney trouble.
Arrangements were then made by
which Dr. Lynott offers the Jeffersonian
readers a free treatment. Dr. Lynott,
however, says that he proposes to give the
free treatment only for a limited time to
convince the public in every part of the
United States of the positive wonderful
efficacy of his treatment.
Furthermore, Dr. Lynott wants to make
it clear that he has no “cure-all.” He is
a specialist in kidney and bladder dis
eases and rheumatism, so please do not
write to him unless you have one of these
diseases. If you write at once, both the
medical advice and the medicine are en
tirely free.
The editor of this paper, the Jefferson
ian, feels that with such a free offer, any
body who stays sick with kidney trouble
or rheumatism deserves to be sick.
I know that a good many free offers
have been advertised where the public
had to send money, but this free offer
really IS A FREE OFFER. And remem
ber that instead of getting an ordinary
physician, you get the medical advice free
direct from America’s greatest of all spe
cialists on these diseases. See Free Treat
ment Certificate at bottom of this page
and get relief right now.

Writing of Dr. T. Frank Lynott, who
gives the medical advice free, a brother
specialist writes as follows:
“I have for years been considered an
authority on urinary diseases; but I
must confess my respect, my profound
sense of esteem, for Dr. Lynott, whose
wonderful success in treating urinary
diseases has surprised us all. Dr. Ly
nott, by the way, is making a most re
markable free offer —the most genuine
and generous offer ever made by a
high-grade physician. It seems to me
the medical world ought not to be
jealous of his success, but should praise
him for what he has done and is doing
for humanity.”
