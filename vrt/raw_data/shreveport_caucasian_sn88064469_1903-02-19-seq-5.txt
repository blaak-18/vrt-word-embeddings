L'ART NOUVEAU IN THE REALM OF
GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES.
Examples of the Incominng Mode-A
New Fad In the Luney Union of
Opal and Turquoise-Beads of All
Kinds Extremnely Popular.
The delightful curves of Fart nouveau i
shape the jewelry that is strictly the
latest. Beauty of form and beauty of
color are its attractions. The new art
avoids the monotony of yellow gold and
tinges the precious metal with tender t
green, with rose, with amber and with I
flamelike hues. It shows straight lines t
and employs every rounded and ser- I
pentinie modeling for which nature can i
afford a suggestion. Its precious stones s
are placed not according to convention,
but to please the eye of the true art- i

ist, for that is what we have now-not
mere mechanics, but art workers, in
jewelry.
The illustrations given are of the
new art.. The shell shaped brooch of
l sea green enamel set with perfect
pearls is not only a dream of loveliness,
but it exemplifies the present fad for
green and whit. The spider web col
lar shows an extreme aspect of the
new mode. Frtunately the spider is
kept well In t background, and the
point that attr cts the eye Is the beau

crude pearl Bfanked by transparent
enamel wings.
The decolletage ornament affords a
better example than the last of I'art
nouveau as it is 4,ommonly seen. With
its curiously cut sapphire center drop
and tasseled side pendants In black and
white pearls, It touches an evening
bodice with exceptional elegance.
Beads for the neck have rolled their
way silently but surely into our affec
tions. Plain gold, turquoise, opal, coral
and amber all exercise their fascina
tions and principally in single strand
throatlets. A variation in these neck
laces is a single row of pale pink coral
t beads divided eac) from its fellows
by a pierced diamond. Opals are treat
ed in the same way. The union of pink
t coral beads and pearls is uncommon
and pleasing.
But the most chic fad and as yet the
property of a few of the "top crust" Is
to combine opals and turquoises, the
well known good fortune of the latter
offsetting any lingering shred of ill
luck that may cling to the opalescent
beauty.

WOMAN OVER THE STEWPAN1
Should a George Eliot Pry Bacon or 1
a Charlotte Bronte Make Hauhk
A very distinguished potentate, not
disinclined at any time to give his opin
ion upon any subject, is reported to I
have made recently the following pro- t
nouncement: "Women should stick to
three things-church. 4hildren and I
kitchen." I seem to see America hold- I
ing its sides as it hears these fateful
words, and even old Engtind smiling I
gently. Germany no doubt most ar- I
dently agrees with the solemn utter
ance. Now. I suppose that we are here,
men and women alike, to progress. The
ideal of the worker is progress. The
thinker is always endeavoring to think
himself forward to a clearer, wider
mind. Men wish to move on, and do
move on, with however faltering steps.
Why, in heaven's name, should women
remain hovering eternally over the
stewpans?
I have no patience with the man who
obstinately ignores the capabilities of
woman and goes on duejaring against
all evidence that she is meant to be a
domestic drudge. That women who
bear children should attend properly
to those children is certain enough.
Some duties stare one in the face and
do not admit of argument. It is also
fairly obvious that an' woman who is
a believer in a religion should not neg
leet her religion.
But what magical law, what strange,
mysterious commandment. links all wo
men in man's mind with the rolling
pin and the basting machine? And
why, when a woman has washed her
offspring, put on the clean dresses,
been to church and cooked the dinner.
should she be debarred from reading
Marcus Aurelius, from practicing Bee
thoven, from writing a novel or from
working out a mathematical problem?
I have known a case of a woman
who was gifted-by whom? The evil
one, $ suppose the church, clildren
and kitchen gentlemen would answer
with a brain. She married. Her hus
band died, and she was left penniless
with certainly two, and I believe three,
young children. She stuck to those
children and has been sticking to them
ever since, supporting them and her
self by using her brain. She is a writer.
If, instead of becoming a distinguished
writer, she had meekly bowed to the
opinion of the potentate and the many
who think with him and had become a
cook, what would have happened to
those children? ibhat would have been
their education?
I know an extraordinarily gifted wo
man musician whose name as a com
poser is famous all over the English
speaking world. Well, she cooks
"Scotch eggs" and "devils" turkey as
no one else can. But she does not do it
every day or even every week, and it
would be agreat pity If she did. She
has done far more for mankind by sit
ting at her piano than she ever could
by bending above the gridiron or by
investigating that sacred thing the
saucepan.
Different women, different duties.
I Why should a Gjiorge Eliot fry bacon
I or a Charlotte Baonte m~ake hash?
If a good plain cook, with the brain
of a peahen. insists on trying to write
novels whem she is only fit for boiling

Secrets of Social Power.
In the art of conversation lies to some
extent the secret of social power. Seek
by every possible means to remedy any
deficiency and by reading and fre
quenting the libraries where books and
magazines are abundant gain thorough
acquaintance with every timely topic.
In due time will come the pleasure 1
of entertaining guests in one's own
home, and in this connection there Is a
never to -be forgotten fact that there
should be an Intimate correspondence
between the circumstances of the host
ess and the style In which she enter
tains. By the use here of the word
"style" It is not Intended to convey the
idea that one may not stamp her enter
tainments with the hall marks of ele
gance and at the same time with sim
plicity.
The unwriten laws of our social life
declare hospitality a reciprocal thing,
and no young woman who seeks to be
honest with herself and the world
should fall to return in some manner
her social obligations unless Indeed by
her talents she has added luster to the
entertainments of others. Even the
bachelor maid may if she have a friend
with her manage many delightful af
tairs.-Table Talk.

L'ABT NOUVEAU RECEPTION GOWN.
It would seem, to work its way out is
the l'art nouveau style. Here is one
specimen of it. with its waved lines,
jewels and rich color effect.
The low blouse, with full elbow
sleeves and three tier skirt in ca
nary yellow satin. red lined, is set off
with reedlike leaves in green satin out
lined with white silk cord. The belt,
epaulets and a huge butterfly motif in
green velvet are embroidered with gold
traceries and inlaid with red stones
by courtesy, rubies. A similar ruby
clasps the belt, and yellow silk stock
ings and gilt kid shoes give the finish
ing touch of color.
As modified panniers of lace or em
broidery have appeared on the hips of
French evening gowns, the picturesque
and gay vogue of Watteau rises among
the probabilities and pleasantly appeals
to youth and a light heart.
Full, rich colors-emerald green, im
perial purple and royal blue-contrast
with nature's tender scheme for early
sprig. Wood brown. too, fills an im
portant place.
The large versus the small hat will
be one of the exciting questions of the
season. Parisian elegantes who are
foremost in the van of fashion seem i)
clined to throw their Influence in with
the latter. But it is not amiss for the
average woman to consider well wheth
r er she will forsale the friendly and be

Neck wraps for the spring entirely

It behooves us to remember that the
box plait and strapping are everywhere
fast replacing the tuck.
The nun's plait in a series similar to
several wide hems appears on some of
the latest evening gowns.

How te Press Moth.
When woolen cloth is to be pressed,
but not washed, it is sometimes a ques
tion of how best to give it the damp
ness that will enable the hot iron to
remove folds and wrinkles. Good re
suits are to 'e had by wringing a sheet
out of warm water, spreading it on a
large table, arranging upon it the
pieces to be pressed and then folding
or rolling all into a bundle. After lying
thus for sev'ral hours the cloth is even
ly damp, but not wet, and all creases
and folds softened to the best possit'ie
condition for the ironing. The pressing
rather than ironing must be done siov,
ly with irons not too hot or too cool,
moving them just fast enough to pre
vent one from printing its outline on
the goods. Hot enough to raise a steam,
but not hot enough to scorch wool, is
right for the irons. Lady's cloth treat
ed thus loses every crease and the too
clinging softness lent it by wear. Thin
ner goods are handled the same way
with equal success. The process is of
course that followed by all tailors and
called "sponging." except that no press
ing follows the dampening of new
cloth, it being merely spread smooth
and left to dry.

[Special Correspondence.]
New York, Feb. 9. - Now indee@
spring seems to be here, for we have
all the lovely and tlowery cottons and
linens, with their dainty colorings and
their sheer delicacy, laid at our feet.
Challies take the lead easily in the
lightweight wools. They ar' as eves
exquisitely printed in tlh loveliest flo
ral designs. where each flower is showy
so near to nature a; to resemble a min

stripes in alT the newest colors. among
them being pearl and silver gray, bis
cuit, tan, golden Drown, royal. navy
and marine blues and awariety of othe1
colors and tints.
Some of the eolieune is sil! and woA
mixed. which makes it most desirable
stuff, and added to its natural beauty
there are iourette stripes. This is in
black, all black sometimes, and then
again it will have white stripes of the
bourette along the black. In many
other cases there is a ground of reseda,
one of the grays, tans or blues, and on
that there is a stripe of white boi*
rette. This is very beautiful. It is a
high priced novelty, costing about $2
a yard, and is forty-four inches wide.
) Very little trimming is required, the
stripes being raised so above the sur
face that it looks entirely to. sumpty
ous to cheapen. s
Flecked eoiiennestavete ground in
one of the colors above mentioned, ant
all over it are flecks of white silk floss.
This is especially dainty on biscuit
light blue or gray. It is expensive, but
so much the more desirable. A twinu
cloth with white bourette tufts and
knots is very stylish and will be one
of the favorites, as Ot is strong, yet
transparent, save where the stripes o0
the bourettes are.
After the voiles one looks to see what
there is to be in the way of suitings.
We find Scotch tweed, novelties in the
way of English tailor suiting and fine
cheviots. Some of the cheviots are in
the colors of the season, but the best
are black. Black is always in fashioio
and no woman can afford to be with
out a black dress.
After the weaves mentioned above
comes the mohair. Last fall I saw
signs that led me to think this would
be a great season for mohair, and I
was not mistaken, for mohair is one of
the best and most popular of all the
silk and wool goods made. This
spring's output has something new in
the treatment that renders the mohair
softer and takes away that harsh feel

and the challies for home gowns for

French challies have black ground and
colored flowers, large or small, to suit
each taste.

making them more valuable. These art
for shirt waists and for house frocks.
Among more expensive and iucidenf
tally more fragile cottons we find "
beautiful French mercerized voile in
all the season's colors, very sheer and
fine. This comes double width. There
are linen grenadines. black with white
brocaded stripes, printed pongee ull,
looking so nearly like the silk that it
takes sharp eyes to see the difference;
and a cotton and silk material called
panne silk. It is intended, like the
pongee mull, for evening wear or for
reception dresses. It comes plain, dotted
or with floral, striped and dresden fig
ures. A reception gown is shown made
of this dainty and inexpensive fabric,
for it costs but 30 cents a yard. The
dress is fitted to the figure by folds and
is trimmed with black chantilly lace.
The dress is ivory white.
The new pattern hats are almost
ready for inspection. and I may say
that never did I see such exquisite
