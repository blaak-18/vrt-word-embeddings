The commencement sermon at
the Epicopal church on last Sun
day, by Rev. I)r. Beverly Warner,
was a most beautiful and pertinent
one, and will, we trust, be long re

The audience was large, and close

paid the best of attention to the
interesting sermon.

The presentation on last Friday
evening of "Tony, the Convict,"
by our local amateurs was a sur

to render this play in several of our
neighboring cities, and we predict
for them much success.
