rHIS GIN hans been in use for the past pnt
I three seasons, and several recent im
pr,,venments have been added. It obvi- onu
ates all friction at the ends of the cotton
box, prevents the roll from braking, and
gives a LARGER YIELD OF LINT from Bel
the sanme amount of Seed than any other nie
Gin iuusc. The Revolving Head light - Ju
ens the drafthnd emupes the Gin to run
faster with less driving' 1wer, thus do- thi
ing a great deal more work H iOhi, the
sameI time, while economtinltg steat or
animal power, than any other Gin. The WC
seed being ginned very close,, the length tlih
- of the staple is increased, producing cot -
ton on this account of a greater market 0o
Svalue. This improved value, given by be
length of staple, with extra production o
of lint, added to increased amount of le
work done, more than covers the cost to
of *he Gin in every 100 bales ginned. tl
