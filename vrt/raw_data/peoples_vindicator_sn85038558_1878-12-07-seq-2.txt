Backing Down.
We are told that Hayes has weak
ened on the bloody-shirt element of
the North, and that public sentiment
in that section was not ripe for a re
turn of sectional politics. If such is
the case, which we see no reason to
doubt, we owe nothing to the Demo
cratio papers of the North for this
back down. On the contrary, they
enoouraged its renewal, and many
of them were as vociferous in our
denunciation as the Republican jour
nals.
We publish elsewhere an extract
from the Cincinnatti (Ohio) Enquirer,
:-ea a specimen of Democratic "slush"
north of the Ohio river. The Enquirer
has never risen to the dignity of un
derstanding the questions at issue in
this country. Violations offunds
mental law could be fully recti8fied,
end the violators panished, by the
enactment of a wild money echeme
so said and acted the Enquirer. In
fact, Mr. Vance, M. C., from that
State told the writer in 1876, that the
Enquirer with its idiotic notions had
coat the Democracy the State of
Ohio more than once.
We desire our readers to observe
earefully, that part of the Enquirer's
article which we have Italicised, where
It is intimated that the loss of a few
Congressmen South, would have been
desirable by the Democracy North.
Now, we assert that this was the
"plan" of the Northern Democracy.
'They have never yet had the spunk
to make an honest square issue with
Radicaliam. They have, on the con
trary, met every charge of the enemy
by temporizing and apology. Even
this year, our District was marked
down as Republican, notwithstand
ing the fact, that ever since 1872, we
had elected a Democrat. Can the
purpose of that "marking down" be
mistaken t Bayes was to be appeased
by the return of Wells to Congress,
and the white men and honest peo
-i e of the 4th Congressional District
of the Commonwealth of Louisiana
were expected to do the dirty work of
the Northern dough face I .
But enough. These details are
sickening, but they are truthful nev
ertheless, and go to make up the rea
sons for the defeat of the Democracy
ha the North.
Judicial Outrage.
Natchitoches has just undergone, or
is rather now undergoing her quoto
.f Bayes' "Southern policy." This
poHioy differs from Grant's, inasmuch
ws the machinery of the army is laid
saide and that of the judiciary substi
t'lted.
Failing to overawe, intimidate or
"rrorise the Southern white men
with troops, recourse is being had to
*tnited 8tStes Marshals. It remains
o Lae seen what superior effacacy the
Fitter possesses over the former.
On Sunday, one Bannon, United
states Deputy Marshal arrived here
with his posse of three. The Chief
was, of course, drank; and in that
sondition prepared to execute the
will of his masters to the letter.
What is that duty, judging from
their acts on the ground ?
Simply to strike as much terror as
Paeir duty(t) will allow them. This
1 is patent from the fact that citizens of
'oir eity visited him, and stated that
tlhe parties for whom he had warrante
weuld promptly report for arrest if
:~rw rames were given. This, he most
,oelhively refused to do; accompany
"eg that refusal with a braggadoeio
etatement: that he "was going to
* the arrests unless he was killed

Our Christmas Edition.
We are so far pleased with the soc
cess which has attended our efforts to
issue the promised Christmas edition
I of the VINDICATOR. If circumatan
ces justify, it is our purpose to issue i
at least four thousand, and we hope
to dispose of the issue to our mer
chants, mechanics, professional and
business men for distribution. Our
charges will be three dollars per hun
f dred copies ; two dollars for fifty, and
Sone dollar for twenty-five.
Orders should be handed in in time
Sto secure attention.
SBeyond the advertisement medium,
. which it will be, the valuable infor
s mation we propose to expend, will
r amply repay any citizen interested in
rour future well-fare who desires to
Sassist as in the enterprise. This in
formation will embrace in part, the
settlement and early history of our
town and parish; habits and customs
Sof its early settlers; soil, climate and
'productions; value of lands. Also,
Natchitochee as a cotton market and
a supply point; with statistics of
Schools, &c., &c.; besides much inter
esting and useful information. Notli
ing of the kind has ever been attempt
ed here before, and its success de
pends mainly upon' the support we
may receive from our citizenls.
Scope of Authority.
We understand that Deputy Mar
slial Bannon has asked if any one
proposed to resist his authority. We
beg to answer, No !-but the scope of
that authority must be considered.
Deputy Bannon most not imagine
that he is an autocrat. On the con
trary his powers are very contracted
although his dignityanod celf-poise
may be large. A Deputy United
States Marshal has the same power as
that enjoyed by any, ward constable
in this parish. The ward constable
can ariest and confine as many men,
can do it under similar authority and
can exercise functions only, which
are laid down in law.
The ordoinary six-penny dignitary
in America has begun to regard him
self as a small sized edition of a Czar.
The sooner he divests himself of such
arrogance, the better. Law is law,
but brute force lends victory only to
the most powerful.
The Arrests.,
At this writing (Wednesday) no
citizens have yet been taken in charge
by the 'Federal United States Mar
shale, four of whom arrived here on
Sunday last. Before we go to press
perhaps they will execute the war
rants, of which they have nine, so
we understand. On Monday three of
the Maiehals went below in the direc
tion of Clootierville to make, it is
supposed, arrests in that section.
Who the persoIs, to judicially bull
dozed and outraged In this section,
are yet remains a profound mystery.
No resistance will be made or was
ever contemplated to the regularly
constituted oficials of the United
States courts. We propose, however,
to resist in the courts to the last ex
tremity any attempt to revive a law,
pronounced oneonstitutional, for the
purpose of persecution. If we are
persecuted, our malignant enemies
shall snffer as well.
Hayes and his disgruntled crowd are
in full cry upon the mode which is cal
colated to solidify for all times the
Solid Sooth. The arrest of citizens
under color of law for refusing to
vote the republican ticket-nay,
for prefering, as is their right, to cast
their ballots, for the Democratic can
didates, brings about that compact
ness in the South which was serioue
ly endangered by the greed for oflce
of a horde of Independents. Let
them therefore "whoop us up." Let
their earthly hell, in all its horrors
come. If there is a single person
whose eye has qasiled or whose
cheek has blanched in face of Hayes'
"new departure" we have yet to see
him. On the contrary, deep indigna
resounds from all sides. Martyrs are
the seeds of principle. Let Hayes
and his minions plant a full crop
that the harvest of justice and right
may be abundant.

Arrest of Loyal and Law Abid
Ing Citizens.
Deputy Marshals Cullum, Casey
and Muilen, arrested, on Tuesday
last at Cloutierville, 30 miles below
this, seven of our best citizens. They
are Dr. S. 0. Scruggs, Messre. WVi.
Airhart, J. B. Rachal, Manuel Board,
E. Masson, James Johnson and Wash
Coekfield.
The affidavits disclose the fact that
Horneby has had these parties arrest
ed upon the charge of "preventing
him from voting for a member of
Congress." The character of Horns
by is so very notorious that all good
people are shocked that the nmachine
ry of a judiciary should be let to an
outcast of his kind, in order that de
cent people should be trampled upon
and outraged.
"Here are brave souls that can vie with
the Spartan
Loyal and true as e'er monarch could
crave ;"
but a deep sense pervades them, that
a foul wrong has been perpetrated in
the name of law, against, not the
gentlemen arrested, who are person
ally inconvenienced and dragged
from their homes and business, but
the whole community.
No one in this parish ever ordered
Hornasby off; no one ever prevented
him from voting for any candidate,
and the reason for his departure is,
that he fed from fear of arrest for at
tempting to kill a citizen in a private
difficulty, which had no connection with
politics whatever.
The prisoners speak in terms of
praise of the conduct of Messirs. Cul
lum, Casey and Mullen, the Marshals,
who had opporiunity and did learn of
what character Hornsby was.
The Apostate.
It seems that the persecuted peo
ple throughout the weorld furnish from
their numbers the material with
which tyrants outrage their victims.
Ireland, the down trodden minion of
Great Britain-the theme of story
and of story-furnishes her quota of
of Marshals, to dog and harass the
down trodden and wronged South;
but, like the struck eagle, we view in
the fatal dart that now is buried in
our bosom, our own feather. South
ern white men arresting at the beck
of Northern masters, their own blood
and civilization!
Would man believe it ?
Yes, 'tis so; and they claim to be
Democrats, and justify, in their own
minds, their conduct upon the sicken
ing plea of a "question of bread."
Judas plead in bar for his crime,
which these men but imitate, that it
was for the support of the Apostles
that he betrayed his Savior.
The civilized world scorns his apol
ogy.
Can there be any excuse framed for
men who, for any reason, would lend
themselves as persecutors of their
own race;. as agents to destroy their
own civilization. Let the cold finger
of scorn meet them at every turn
let them be cursed of every thing
virtuoos.
Eternal misery awaits the apostate.
Those that deal with us once,
always come again. Our prices
are the lowest, H. A. Walmsley
& Co.
Three of the Deputy United States
Marshals who came up last week are
not to be included in the charge of
drunkeness and rowdyism. Messrs
Cullom, Mullen and Casey, the three
accompanying, discharged their duty,
disagreeable and outrageous as it is, in
a gentlemanly manner, and their con
sideration for the feelings of their fel
low American citizens has been re
ciprocated by kind treatment at the
hands of our people.
We invite your attention to our
large and handsome stock, H. A.
Walmuley & Co.

SMonday, Decembher 2d, 1878. dIawn
ed clear and beautiful. Early in the
morning number ia of citizens began
to arrive in our city to attend Court
as jurors and witnesses, and by 12
o'clock M., the parements in front of
the Court House, atnl the hall of tIhe
building were tilled with people, not
withstanding sutroe excitement which
prevailed, on account of the arrival
in our midst of four U. S. Deputy
Marshals, with wartants to arrest a
number of our citizens, the Judge
t promptly opened Court at 12 M. The
members of our talented bar and
SCourt officers were present ready for
f busuiness, as the Judge took the
. bench.
Mr. Alex. E. Sompayrac was se
lected as Foreman of the Grand Ju
ry, and the following persons drawn,
duly empaneled and sworn, vis:
A. E. Sompayrac, Foreman; J. J.
McCook, H. F. Weaver, It. W. Mur
phy, S. F. Quarles, B. S. Sweat Jr.,
1H. C. Garrett, T. E. ProthIro, G. T.
Rowe, W. P. Cannon, C. F. L'Heris
son, Wade H. Lowe, Ursin Lambre,
J. B. `W. Mc'Cook, J. S. Trichel, J. M.
Stokes.
The Judge in his usual impressive
and lucid manner, delivered his
charge to the Grand Jury, instructing
them as to their duties, and especially
charging them as to violations of the
franchise laws.
On Tuesday, a number of motions
and exceptions were filed in various
civil suits, and criminal cases fixed.
Upwards of sixty criinial cases,
which had for years encumbered tihe
docket, and become in a manner, dead
letters, were stricken therefrom on
motion of District Attorney W. P.
Hall. The case of the State vs. Jas.
Atkinson was then taken up, and af
ter a lengthy trial, lasting far into
the night, a verdict was rendered of
not guilty.
Wednesday was occupied entirely
with the trial of Anthony Thomas,
colored, for manslaughter. This case
has been pending for some four years,
and is one of three growing out of the
same trouble. Thomas was ably
represented by Messrs. J. H. & M.
J. Cunningham, and W. H. Jack Esq.,
and was found not guilty by a Jury
of white citizens.
With this case closes our report for
the present week. It is observable in
tihe Court room that rhe utuost order
and decorum prevails, thanks to tIhe
dignity of the presiding Judge, and
tihe instant punishment of any person
who exhlibits any disrespect to the
Court. The wheels of justice run
smoothly, and thie routine of Court
business goes on without a jar or dis
cord. Without intending to commit
wvhat is called half scandal, that is,
self-praise, we doubt greatly if there
are many parishes in the State which
can excel Natchitoches in their ses
sions of District Court, or in the af
fability and learning of the Judge,
the eloquence and legal ability of its
lawyers, and the intelligence and
thorough knowlede of their duties of
Court offcers.

Formation of Frost.
We take pleasure in printiug the
following note from the United States
Signal Otflcer at this port, on the snb
ject of the formation of frost at rela
tively high temperatures:
To the Editor of the Picayune:
In reply to your inquiry of "How
can frost be formed at a temprature of
480 7
I have the ironor to say that frost
will form at any time whlen the tern
prature of the "dew-point" falls be
low320 Fahrenheit.
The "dew-poiut" is the temperature
at which tire moisture of the air is
condensed; it may be found by cool
ing a vessel, or any article, until the
moistore of the air is condensed on it,
and then taking the temprature of the
article at the moment this deposition
beings, which is the dow-point.
When the air is saturated with mois
tore, or the relative humridity is 100,
then frost will not form at a tempera
tore above 32 Fahrenheit; but the
more dry the air is, that is the less
moisture it contains, the less the tem
perature will have to form frost.
For example: Suppose the tempers
ture of the air to be 480; suppose
the temperature of the wet bulb to be
400 wihch will give a relative humid.
ity of 43per cent., and the "comple
meet of the dew-point," or time differ
ence between the temperature of the
air andthe temperature of the der
point will be 16 80, which, subtracted
from the temprature of tire air, 480,
will give 31'20 for the dew poin t, and
frost wlii be deposited under these air
cumstances, which is often the case
here.

servant, A. (J. Sixox,
