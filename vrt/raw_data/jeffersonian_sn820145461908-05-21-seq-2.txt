Hoiv the Governor Palks About
Mr. Watson.
i
From several different towns at which
Gov. Smith has made speeches come let
ters from different writers who feel that
I should know how the Governor talks
about me in private conversations.
I give two of these, omitting the
names of my correspondents for obvious
reasons.
(First.)
Bainbridge, Ga., May 3, 1908.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir:
While listening to a conversation be
tween the Hon. Hoke Smith and several
of his supporters in this city, on last
Thursday afternoon, soon after he had
finished his 2 1-2 hours’ speech, one of
his most prominent supporters in this
section asked Mr. Smith this question:
What effect did he think your not be
ing for him this time would have on his
majority in the election on the 4th of
June? Mr. Smith laughed and said:
“NONE AT ALL, OF COURSE, AS IT
IS ALREADY A WELL-KNOWN
FACT THAT TOM WATSON HAD
LOST HIS FOLLOWING IN GA.
AND THAT HE WOULD AS SOON
THAT HE BE AGAINST HIM AS
FOR HIM, AS HE WOULD NEVER
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND
DID NOT CARE A STRAW FOR
WHAT WATSON THOUGHT OR
DID.”
At first I did not think that I would
tell you of this at all, but when I re
member your grand work for him two
years ago, and noticed his utter disre
gard for your kindness, I felt it my duty
to tell you.
(Second.)
Americus, Ga., April 30th, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
My Dear Sir:
Several people who heard Mr. Hoke
Smith’s speech at Cordele last Tuesday
say, that he was asked “why you refused
to give him your support,” and he replied,
“that he did not know unless you were
angry with him because he refused to
pardon the red-handed murderer, Glover,
of Augusta, Ga.,” and then he explained,
in a very dramatic style, what a cold
blooded brutal affair it was, and that
your request was made as a personal fa
vor.
Now, I am satisfied that Mr. Smith
misrepresented your attitude in connec
tion with this matter, and as I have pro
found respect for your sincerity- of pur
pose, I will thank you to let me know if
Mr. Smith has told the truth, and the
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
whole truth about this matter.
With sincere good wishes, I am,
Yours truly,
Time and again, I have shown that the
Governor was not asked to pardon Glover,
and that the application which was made
for commutation of sentence to imprison
ment for life, was based upon the fact
that the Board of Physicians making an
examination of his mental condition re
ported him “defective” and “decadent”;
and that my name had been lugged into
the case by Boykin Wright—the bitter
est personal and political enemy that I
ever had—to prejudice the jury against
the crack-brained Glover, who was spe
cially hateful to Boykin Wright and the
rest of the Augusta Ring because he was
an obnoxious Populist who had always
defied them.
When the Governor states that he was
asked to pardon this man, and fails to
state that the examining physicians offi
cially reported that he was a decadent and
defective— MEANlNG, OF COURSE,
MENTALLY UNSOUND,—he alto
gether misrepresents me and the case.

Holv the Wall Street 'Rascals Buy
the Pribilege to Rob.

T( that glorious National Convention
which the Democrats held in St. Louis, in
1904. the Virginia delegation was cariied
by Thomas F. Ryan. He carried the pa
triots in his private car, and duly deliv
ered them to Parker, whose nomination
was being bought by Wall Street.
Among the Wail Street stock juggkrs
and railroad wreckers, Thomas Ryan
holds a proud and dominant place. I: is
probable that a grander rascal never
walked the earth. He is now the owner
of more than fifty millions of wealth, not
a dollar of which was produced by his
labor. He has accumulated his riches
partly by robbing other Wall Street rob
bers, and partly by robbing the innocent,
ignorant, cowardly public. In his wreck
age of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, in
his dealings with Trust Companies and
banks, in his manipulation of the New
York street car lines, he has plundered
weaker plunderers and a patient public
with equal audacity and impunity.
Recently a Grand Jurv and a Prosecu
ting Attorney have been questioning Mr.
Ryan about some of his financial doings,
but as the Grand Jury was packed by
the Wall Streeters and the Prosecu
ting Attorney (Jerome) is a Wall
Street henchman, Ryan was permitted to
gloss over everything in his own way, and
no indictment was found, although his
testimony abounded in self-evident fabri
cations to hide crime.
This much, however, did crop out, that
Ryan and the late William C. Whitney,
who was a member of Cleveland’s Cabi-
net, had put $;oo,ooo, at one time, into
the Republican Campaign fund.
At another time, they paid $20,000 to
the Republicans and $16,000 to the Dem
ocrats, in New fork, to secure protection
from both parties.
Protection from what? Protection from
legal molestation while they were robbing
ompanies which thev controlled.
Such a chapter in crime, in deliberately
planned thievery as that which is dis
closed bv the manipulation of the New
York traction corporations by Whitney,
Belmont, Ryan, and a few lesser thieves
can only be found when we investigate
some of the deals and reorganizations of
J. P. Morgan, George Gould, E. H. Harri
man and E. C. Morse.
It absolutely reeks with rascality of the
most atrocious and Hgantic kind.
And whv could it never be checked and
punished ?
Because the big rascals bought safety
from the politicians of both the old par
ties.

Is 'Bryan Catering, to the Negro
Vote?
What is the inevitable conclusion to be
drawn from Mr. Bryan’s studied silence
concerning the Brownsville affair?
On every other subject Mr. Bryan is
voluble, not to say garrulous. But while
the whole country has rung with Browns
ville and the negro troops, for two long
years, not a chirp on that subject do we
get from the most talkative man on
earth.
Upon all other matters, our strenuous
President has had the endorsement of Mr.
Bryan. On Brownsville and the dismiss
ed soldiers, the silence of the eloquent
Nebraskan is emphatic.
Every American who can talk or write
has had his shot at the Brownsville is
sue, excepting that particular American
who makes a specialty of talking and
writing about everything.
Why this studious and persevering
silence?
The negro leaders have “served no
tice” on the quaking Republican leaders
that if Roosevelt or Taft is nominated
the negroes will knife the ticket.
They can only do this by voting the
Democratic ticket. Has Mr. Bryan based
his calculations upon this threatening at
titude of the negroes, and is that the
reason why he has been mum on Browns
ville?
By the way, Mr. Bryan, what do you
think of Mr. Roosevelt’s dismissal of
those negro troops?
Was he wrong, as Foraker and Till
man contend, or was he right, as all the
rest of us claim?
It is a fair question:—ANSWEß IT,
MR. BRYAN!
