Natchitoches Parish presents
M J. CUNNINGH %M ESQ.,

For Sheriff.
We are authorized to anoonnce L. A.

subject to nomination by the Democratic
Convention of this parish.
Monopolies.
"-'h ter defines "Monopoly"--"the
,ver or permission to deal; ex
â€¢e command or possession, &c.;"
Uo. of late years every species of bu
sine~s where competition does not ex
ist, is denounced as a "monopoly."
The New Orleans and Red River
Transportation Company comes in for
a share of this tirade, when the fact
is, that Company can no more be
classed as a monopoly, per se, and in
the sense indicated by those who so
vigorously assail it, than Bob Brown's
only cross road store in a country
neighborhood can be denounced as
such.
If this Transportation Company
had a "monopoly of Red River" then
no other Boats than those of their
line would be permitted to come with
in ites waters. Such, however, is not
the case, for the monopoly attained
by Captain Aiken and his Company
is one of which they should be proud.
It has been gained by the strictest
attention to the wants of the people,
whom it has supplied with boats at
regular times, while freight charges in
comparison with the old days of
steamboat sloshing up and down the
river is much lower. The business
attention of this Company has at
tracted friends and warm supporters
to its help and sustinance. System is
the first requisite in business and that
is reduced to perfection by the able
President of this Company.
Now let us see what this Company
has done for Red River beyond the
mere transportation of freight. We
speak now from personal knowledge.
Capt. Aiken has been the most per
sistant friend our valley has ever had
in securing appropriations to improve
the navigation of Red River. He has
made, last winter and spring, not
less than two visits to Washington,
where he remained and worked for
weeks at each time to secure appro
priations tor ,the Mouth, the Falls;
for Tones' Bayou, for the Raft, and to
remove snaggs and obstructions, and
to jetty the bars in low, water, there
by insuring high water freight tariff
the year 'round.
Will those who ignorantly attack
the "Pool Line" be kind enough to
name a single "Independent" steam
boatman who has ever done any
thing for Red River, save to run a
steamboat for accommodation (!) and
receive his pay for it t Captain Ai
ken is not supposed to do all this
for love to us, pure and simple; but,
he has business relations with us
which demand and receieve all his
thought and energies, and his doing
it assists him while it greatly bene
fits us. "High freights in low wa
ter" is the standing demand of all
these croakersu who yell like blaseA
for an "indeplndent boat,"' andistill
not a steamboatmsan, before Captain
Aikens' Company wasorganized, ever
made an effort to secure us the boon
of high water freight at all seasons,
and Captai Aikena has !
We make this defense in justice to
Captain Aiken, and we at6 assured it
meets the hearty approval of the mass
of our business men and shippers.
Kearney, the "sand-lot" Californla
agitator, is noit the demogogue the i
sa would tnake him. Unles
4 political parties recognize the
' of the peolh, "Kearneys" will
be as thick as betries in Junoe, all
over the United 8tate. The Demoe
racy of this State have planted thewn
selves aloogside the people, and we
recommend their platform as an anti
dote for Kearneylaie.

How They Did It.
In June, 1877, the democratic Po
lice Jury took charge of this parish
and for the first time were able to ar
rive at a correct statement of the in
debtedness of the parish incurred by
the radical party since 1868.
They found, according to the pub
lished report of Mr. A. E. Lemec,
parish Treasurer, the following judg
ments and floating debt, which these
thieves and scoundrels have left us as
a sweet legacy :
Balance due on judgments $61,533,81
Interest on same to Ist Dec.
1878, 5 years at 8 per
cent 23,813 52
Amount of warrants certi
ficates, &c., issued in '76
and previous years out
standing and in circula
tion 24,561 04
Grand Total 8114,918 37
This is what was found to remain
unpaid of the amounts squandered by
these radicals from the people of Nat
chitoches,
Now what amount did they steal
beyond this; for they got away with
this *114,918 37 . That is readily
told.
18-8...... $18,000 00
1869...... 17,000 00
1870 ...... 20,000 00
1871...... 35,600 00
1872...... 16,640 00
1873...... 26,500 00
1874...... 19.200 00
1875...... 13,000 00
1876...... 14,1100 00
1877...... 13,500 00
Total.... $193,440 00
These are the regular expenses year
ly during the whole of the radical
reign. Nor is this all ! The amount
cash paid by the people on account of
the judgments, which amounted in
all to $164,663 28, was-8-100,129 41.
GRAND STEALINGS
Add all these amounts together and
you have the grand steal, viz :
Paid on judgments $100,129 41
Levy for regular expenses 193,440 00
Still due 114,918 37
$408,487 78
In other words, the radical party
stole .L ten years one third of the ralue
of al rthe personal and real estate in
parish in the shape of parish taxes
alane !
And yet these fellows are fixing up
a reform ! ticket, and are going to
elect it and be honest in future. Bah !
Manton Marbles' Letter.
Thiis gentleman has written a letter
in which le makes public for the first
time Mr. Tildens' efforts to secure the
presidency and his opposition to the
electoral commisson.
We have been satisfied all along
that great injustice has been done Mr.
Tilden. His silence has been taken
advantage of by those very men who
spurned his advice and adopted a plan
instead which led to the disgraceful
defeat of last winter.
This letter will be attentively read
and will do much to silence tihe yelps
of a great number of small men
against Mr. Tilden.
Those Amendments.
The Democracy in Convention as
sembled treated the Amendments
with marked disfavor. They were
not even deemed worthy of mention.
With such a "start" the hopes their
friends may have entertained of their
adoption of course have gone "'a
glimmering."
So'much for the attempt to nsnrp
the prerogatives of a sovereign peo
pie.
Enforce It.
11th. That it is the sense and judna
ment of the Convention, that the legis
lature of this Stare at its next Sesion
should provide for the calling and as
;embling of a Convention in the earli
sat possible time tlhereafter, and to
frame and establish a new Constitu
tion of the State of Louisiana.
The above, from the platform of
the Democrae: of Louisiana, contains
rhe very germ. of our political exist
ance and it must be enforced to the
very letter. And how t Simply, by
andlngto the ]egsilaiure only those
men, good, true and tried, who will
obey the behests of the party.

.The popular faith in the honesnty,
sincerity:and courage of the Adminis
tmtion cannot sustain itself on repeant
ed disappointment. People are apt to
forget their preference for Evarts,
Schnrs and Sherman, over Belknap,
Robinson and Delano, when they see
sa4h appointments as that of Levisee,
one of the Presidential electors of
Louisiana, to a federal rllee. The
general improvements in the tone of
etvil service makes these relapses all
the more emompieauouns and ezaspera.

Maijor 1llCnenre failed of oliniila
tion from a comibination of 1unf1toreseeni
circunistances over which he had no
control. The first, and in the end
fatal, blow he received, was from the
candidacy of Col. Richardson, of
Ouachita, as the an ti-Constitutiolal
Conceintion man. The second set
back was the yellow fever in New Or
leans, which caused him to loose the
moral support of the presence in per
son of at least a hundred able dele
gates, and last, but not least, Major
Moncure suffered from the want
of a sagacious leader on the floor
of the Convention.
It is all settled now, however, and
to the satisfaction at least of every
one, but as opinions were being freely
given all around, we beg to record
ours.

HISTORY OF EPIDEMICS IN NEW
ORLEANS.
According to the best writers, the
great epidemics that have scourged
New Orleans in the past may be tab
ulated as follows, with timeof break
ing out and whole number of deaths
)Deat hs.
1817- June 18 ................ 800
1819 -July 1................. 2,190
lk47-August ..................2,259
1853-May....................?7,970
1854-July.................. 2,453
1855- June ..................... ,6710
1858-June...... ..........3.889
1867-June 10..................3,039
These were the years in which Yel
low Jack's chief ravages occured, but
the disease has been in New Orleans
every year and fall since 1817, except
three years during the war, when
Gen. Bottler kept the city so clean
and so isolated from West India vcs
sels, which almost always imports the
fever, that New (urlerns during 1862.
'63 and '64 remained perfectly healthy,
not a single case of the malady ap
pealing. So much for quarantine.
During several years not mentioned
above the fever was pretty bad in
New Orleans; as, fot instance, in 1822,
when 239 deaths occurred; 1829 215
deaths 1837, 442; 1839, 452; 1841, 541
1848, 850. In 1873 the fever broke out
in the most filthy quaiter of the city.
Thet e were 223 deaths, but the disease
was successtfly stamped oat by car
bolic acid. At present the prospect
for a great epidemic is promising.
Yellow Fever.
[Shreveport Times Telegrams.]
New Orleans, August 9.-New cases
to-day 44; deaths 12. The fever
continues to spread and is now well
distributed through the first and se
coud districts with occasional cases,
in other quarters of the city. The
board of health continue the use of
carbolic acid as a disenfectant, but
will try lime in a few days, Mr. J. C.
Clark general manager of the Jack
son road, having presented ten car
loads of fresh burnt lime. Arrange
ments are also being perfected for
irrigating the city by flushing the
gutters with river water. The hopes
of thile health officers of checking the
disease by carbolization seemt to
weaken. This city is generally con
coded to be in a tilthier condition thau
for fifteen years-in fact, since Gene
ral Butler had it cleaned. The fever
prevailing here is of a mild type, and
the board of health as decided to con
tin ue quarantine against visitors from)l
ilft'ected plots on the ground that
more malignanit virus might Ie intro
duced. The Bee, complhuning of the
withdrawal firom .publication by the
board of health of yellow fever bul
letin of new cases, observes in rie
gard to death register: "These re
ports relate only to mortality cause
ed by yellow fever; at least they
are given as such, although including
some very strange cases of deaths.
For example, deaths of children loru
here and of Creole parentage we must
:icknowledge that it is difltcult for us
to believe that these children, doubly
Orleanaians both by reason of their
birth and race, should be the victitims
of yellow fever. Can it be that we
have some other malady prevalent
amongst us "

YELLOW FEVER REPORT.
(Shreveport Stanrd:rd.)
New Orleans, Angst 13.-Yellow
fever for the past twenty-four ho is
--new casesforty-three; deaths twen
ty-one.
The Auditor complains that local
quarantines prevents him from send
ing the necessary blanks and official
drcuments to tax colecters and other
oflicials.
MEMI'hIS, August 13.--Excitement
here over the news from Grenada.
The Bord of Health is nmikeinrg every
exertion to prevent, its introduction
here.
iOLLY SPrIIx'.s, Miss., Aug., 13,--It
is reported that the yellow fever has
broken out among the troops. The
city is clean.
Jackson, Miss., August 13.--Reports
from G0renada and Vicksburg, causes aI
great panic thronghout this section.
Nurses from New Orleans passed up
to Grenada to-day.
Grenada, Miss., August 13.-One
hundred cases of yellow fever have
occurred: twelve (leaths ; ten deaths
in the last twenty four hours.
Vickshurg, August 13.-There was
a general rush out of town yesterday
and to day, on acclunt ' of one fatal
ease of yellow fever originating here.
There are three other cases in the
city hospital.
New Orleans, August 12.-Among
the recent deaths from yellow fever
is Rev. Mr. Davidson, Jewish rabbi,
aged thirty-nine. The Bord of Health
continue cariolization and points to a
slow increase of the disease as the
result. The Howard association ad
vertise for fifteen experienced nurses
to go to Grenada, Miss. It is nider
stood physicians will also be sent to
that place.
Port Eands, Angst 1-.-Three new
cases and one death. Mrs. Mann wife
of Capt. Mann and three childaen
have the fever. Several of the sick are
not expected to recover.
We commend the following to those
of us who are acting physicians with

The little town of Grenada, in Mis
sissippi, has the yellow fever, and it
-is spreading with great rapidity. As
Grenda is thie place where the Menm
phis quarantine officers put off New
Orleans passengers, it is evident that
the disease was imparted by contact
withi some of thoese. As long as plain
men see before their eyes tie nalked
fact that people who come in contact
with others who have the fever, will
take it; that it spreads in this uran.
ner ; and that of a given number who
take it may die, they will not be apt
listen to lonig-windled discussions as
to the origin of the fever, but will
take tlie precaution which naturally
suggests itself. No town wich is in
dantger of receiving passengers frour
infected districts should neglect a
strict quarantine. We ihope our own
vigilant Biaid of Health will not
relax its efforts in pro!eeting Sireve-.
port againiit this dreadful disease.
When all tihe dngirigr is over, rwireni
we shall have had our eyes gliddened
by tire sight of a black frost, we cair
then organize a debating society fior
those who are Irore interested in dis
covering thie cause of the disease ilan
in keeping it aunay from us, to dis
cuss it to their heart's content.
Slreveport Standard.
Grenada is a town in the healthy
salubrious hill of Mississippi, and this
fever was brought there by contact
with New Orleans.
Quarantine.
The necessity for a rigid quarantine
none can gainsay. As long as boats
come to this parish from New Orleans
there is great danger to be appre
liended from an introduction of the
scourge now prevailing in that city.
Stop cmrunnnication with New Or
leans and we are safe.
Why some people, with these facts
staring them in the face will oppose
a quarantine we cannot understand.
Do they desire yellow fever here ?
We do not believe they do.
Business of course will be affected,
but we must all suffer for the good of
thie public.
