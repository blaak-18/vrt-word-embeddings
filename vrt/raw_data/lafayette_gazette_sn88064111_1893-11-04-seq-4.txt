of the Age.
KENNEDY'S
MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
DONALD KENNEDY, OF ROXBURY, MASS.,
Has discovered in one of our common
pasture weeds a remedy that cures every
kind of Humor, from the worst Scrofula
down to a common-'Pimple.
He has tried it in over eleven hundred
cases, and never failed except in two cases
'both thunder humor). He has now in his
possession over two hundred certificates
of itg value, all within twenty miles of
Boston.
A benefit is always experienced from
the first bottle, and a perfect cure is war
ranted when the right quantity is taken.
When the lungs are affected it causes
shooting pains, like needles passing
through them; the same with the Liver or
Bowels. This is caused by the ducts being
stopped, and always disappears in a week
after taking it.
If thestomach Is foul or bilious it will
cause squeamish feelings at first.
No change of diet ever necessary. Eat
the best you can get, and enough of it.
Dose, one tablespoonful in water at bed
time. Read the Label. Send for Book.

8 the Co 1 umbian
fair draws nearer
to its close the fun
grows fast and
furious. Thet is to
say the bustle and
excitement grows
apace. Day in and
day odt the great
programme of
events is carried
out, and so numer
* ous and varied are
its features that
several of the greater events are often
crowded into one day. For instance,
last Saturday, September 9, the Grand
Army of the Republic held a grand
meeting in the fair grounds at the same
time the Californians were holding
high carnival at their state building.
Another momentous event occurred on
the same day, namely, the dedication of
the new Liberty bell, which had just
.arrived from its birthplace at Troy, N.
Y., where it was made to the order of the
Daughters of the American Revolution.
The grand army men and the Californ
ians took an active part in the dedica
tion of the new bell and the three events
were combined, making of the day one
of the most memorable periods of the
world's fair season.
The bell is one of the finest castings
ever made. Not a flaw is in the metal.
It is composed of a curious compound
of precious and base metals. More
than ten thousand dollars' worth of
old gold and silver ornaments, coins
and jewelry were contributed by the
patriotic members of the order. An
old cent which was worth one hundred
dollars fromn its historical association
was contributed. The tone is very
sweet because of the quality of the
casting and the metaL It weighs six
and a half tons-thirteen thousand

pounds. Although it is one of the
largest bells of the world, it does not
approach in size that of the enormous
bell at Moscow, u hich weighs twenty
five thousand pounds.
The bell is six feet high-and eight
feet in circumference at the mouth. It
has a bright luster of a brassy nature.
There are three inscriptions on it, one
at the top ryige, another in the center
and one at the lower edge. The upper
one reads: "Glory to God in the high
est; on earth good will toward men."
The central inscription is: "A new
command I give unto ye, that ye love
one another." The lower is: "''Proclaim
liberty throughout the land and unto
the inhabitants thereof."
This Columbian liberty and peace
bell is attracting world-wide notice,
and it is indeed a worthy successor of
the old clarion of independence; but it
is not nor never will be regarded with
the same reverence that is lavished on
the decrepit veteran that rung defiance
to the forces of Great Biritain, wvhen
this great nation was but a puny com
monwealth taking its first lessons in
self-governmnent on the shores of the
Atlantic.
The dedication ceremonies of the new
bell were very impressive and inspiring,
many noted people taking part and de
livering eloquent addresses. The bell
is suspended from a huge framework
immediately in front of the eastern en
trance of the Administration building.
from which proud position its tones go
ringing through the grand Court of
Honor and out upon the blue waters of
old Lake Michigan.
At the present writing there is in ses
sion at the fair the greatest assemblage
of religious leaders the world has ever
seen, representative exponents of every
religious creed under the sun. This
meeting is certainly a most extraor
dinary affair. and it is undoubtedly
of great import among the religions of
the world. Durtng the sessions of this
most remarkable congress the different
leaders of moral and religious teach
ings ventilate their respective views
and compare notes on the means of
bringing the people of all lands to a
higher state of morality and intellectu
ality. To behold the fraternization of
teachers of men so widely divergent in
their tenets and views is in truth a
marvel for the age to contemplate with
the most earnest commendation.
The celebrations among the various
state buildings are still attracting
immense crowds. During the last few,
days New York, Kansas and Maryland
as well as California have kept open
house to the world, and in each in
stance the affair has been a kreat suc
cess. The state of Indiana has fixed
upon September 27 as Indiana day at
the fair, on which occasion the Hoosiers
will doubtless create a big splurge.
The big cows and horses have about
had their day at the fair, and they are
to be followed by the smaller stock an
imalS in their turn. The live stock
show has been an unqualified success
thus far, and the management is to be
cong'atulated uaon the eminently sat

PEOPLE WHO. EAT.

World's lair Vsntors.
- inng in the ppen air is one of the
enjoyments of the fair. Never before
has anyone seen so many people eat
ing in open nooks and corners as may
be- seen almost any day; except Sun
day, at the_ great exposition. The
.weather just now is peculiarly agreea
ble for this sort of gastiononio enter
tainment. There is usually a cool, re
freshing breeze fnoh the lake which
seems to act on the system as a tonic
and '"appetizer," like a cocktail or a
glass of sherry before dinner.
The visitors who bring their lunches
are legion, and they seem to be eatlng
at all hours and in every imaginable
spot where seats can be found. They
are nearly always in faminly groups,
obliviout to their surroundings, and
fully bent on taking solid comfort.
They carry their lunch, as a rule, in
boxes or cheap wooden baskets, which
can be discarded when the contents have
been swvallowed.
The live stock pavilion, with its
great amphitheater of shady seats, now
that it is not occupied, furnishes a most
desirable lunching spot for visitors
from the country. Over along tue lake
shore, wherever benches or boxes are
found to sit upon, many lunch parties
are always to be seen.The terraces at the
tops of buildings, the porches and veran
das of state buildings,the shady corners
under the peristyle, and above all the
green spots on the wooded island, offer
special attractions to the piznic parties.
The scenes at these places between
twelve and twvo o'clock are most di
verting and sometimes quite amusing.
The impromptu tables are filled with
all sorts and conditions of people. A
party of four, two pretty women and a
couple of men in summer attire, will be
seen next to a group of students in
queer costume with flowing cravats.
Near by a couple who have no time to
observe their surroundings will be
busily engaged with each other. Bu'
! most of those who arieating engage in
animated conversation about the mar
vels of the fair all around them, making
gestures, pointing out certain buildings
which they wart to inspect more com
pletely, and sometimes laughing aloud
at a witticism offered by sonme vivacious
member of the party.-Chicago Inter
Ocean.
WORLD'S FAIR VISITORS.
They Are as Iuelh orf a Sight as tile Ex
htlbiton Itself.
The best cataloguers would not have
included in their lists all the sights of
the fair. One of the most interesting
sights of all, for example, is the sight
seers themselves-quite as amusing and
as instructive, too, for the curious ob
server of humanity, its foibles and its
. virtues. as anything in Prof. Putnam's
department of anthropology. The
crowd is not exactly of the kind that
flocked to the Centennial exposition in
1870, and decidedly not of that sort
that thronged the Champ de Mars in
Paris in 1889. It is more sophisticated
than the former and less joyous and at
the same time less truly appreciative of
its opportunity than the latter. The
Americans have grown perceptibly in
culture and grace since the Centennial
I brought them together to exhibit them
selves and their crudeness to commiser
ating foreigners, and the growth is
strongly impressed upon the observer.
Along with the linen duster,wvhich was
the distinguishing outward mark of the
American citizen at Philadelphia in
1876, we seem to have discatled a good
deal else that was bucolic in mental at
titude as well as in physical appearance.
The people now here impress you as a
rule as being people who are well-read
in contemporary human history, and ac
customed to seeing something of life.
They know how to carry themselves
with a fair degree of dignity and grace,
and are well-informed of what has
been going on in the world in recent
years.-Providence (R. I.) Journal.

"Did I understand ye to read that
there was up'ards o' two hundred an'

show in one day, IEzry?" inquired Uncle
Tobias Slocum of his son.
"Them was the figgers!" responded
Ezra, solemnly.
"An' there wa'n't .so crowd, even
then?" asked Uncle Tobias, after a
' pause.
"No crowd anywhere," said Ezra.
There was a long silence, broken
only by the fluttering of the newspaper
in Ezra's hand, as the breeze blew in
at the window.
"Well," said Uncle Tobias, at last,
drawing a long breath, '"I ain't pre
pared to doubt the papers, an' I know
they've got a powerful lot of land set
apart fer that show, but it does appear
to me that if I'd ben on hand along

A BANQUET TO BE A CLIMAX
To Be Given by World's Fair Directors to
a Distinguished Company.
A committee of the board of directors
of the world's fair has been appointed
to take charge of a great exposition
banquet to be given to the foreign
commissioners, President Cleveland and
cabinet, the governors of the states
and great dignitaries of the world, Oc
tober 10 or 12. The intention is to dis
tance anything heretofore attempted
in America, and the plans are upon a
scale in keeping with the country, the
fair and Chicago. Expenses are not to
be thought of until after the event is
over. The guests are to number five or
six hundred. For h banquet hall the
present intention is to use the Audi
torium, Central Music hall, or some
large theater. A great floor is to be
constructed and the decorations are to
be unlimited. Sweet music is to come
from hidden minstrels while the wines
ofi'the Orient are used to pledge the
future of the Occident The purest of
oratory is to flow along with the rarest
of champagne as the greatness of the
fair and the good will of all nations to
Chicago is told in song and story. At
present artists are working on the
elaborate invitation cards. If Chicago
men can do anything great the exposi
tion banquet will be greater than any
other yet attempted.-Chicago Tribune.
A Model [Manager.
A more graceful, gracious and able
presiding officer than Mrs. Potter
Palmer can hardly be imagined.
Beautiful and always faultlessly
dressed in pretty summer gowns which
fit her charming little figure to perfec
tion, Mrs. Palmer stands at the long
table in the board room of the lady
managers of the world's fair, wielding
her little mallet with judgment and
tact. All sorts of unpleasant elements
are to be met in the little company.
One state thinks itself slighted in the
general distribution of jurors of award;
another complains that her scheries
are not followed; a third asserts that
she has been maliciously treated, and a
fourth wishes passes for her family to
the third and fourth generation. But
Mrs. Palmer's mental endowment is
fully equal to her physical gifts, and
she keenly foresees and averts con
troversy. She told a belligerent mem
ber, who lately insisted on examining
the secretary's minutes, that "no busi
ness will be transacted until members
are seated," and thus she ingeniously
guides her troubled bark away from
shoals and quicksands. It is a fine les
son in parliamentary law to spend an
hour in studying her methods. The
man who sits by, and who is said to
have been her teacher in these matters,
is rarely consulted now.
From the World's Four Corners.
A little of something from rall the
world's four corners seems to be gath
ered into the world's fair corners, and
with so many strange people, new
buildings, strange customs and curiosi
ties, it would be a wonder if unusual
events did not succeed each other with
great rapidity. The thrce quaint cara
vels, the Santa M:aria, the Pinta and
Nina, exact reproductions so far as pos
sible of the veritable ships in which
Columbus brought his crew to America
four hundred years ago, have sailed ip
to Chicago from Spain, the gift of that
government to our own; thousands of
singers from the musical societies of
the large western cities have gathered
in Chicago for a festival week and sung
sone of the choice works of the masters
of music; France has celebrated the
taking of the bastile with great energy,
as is its annual custom; Machinery hall
tower has been struck by lightning,
but escaped further injury; the Viking
ship and its Danish crew have been
welcomed with great firing of guns and
waving of banners; and so the busy
days go on, each with its special inci
dent or excitement.
"The C1o,oOO Beauty."
The first Columbian half dollar, for
which Wyekoff. Seamans & Benedict
paid the exposition #10,000, is on exhib
ition in the Remington booth, section
"F," block '2," northeast corner, main
balcony, Manufactures building. A
special Columbian guard keeps watch
over the coin constantly from nine un
til five o'clock, at which time it is locked
up in one of the Cary screw door fire
and burglar-proof safes, with time-lock
attachment. The coin is inclosed in a
heavy case of cast brass and plate glass,
and with it are displayed the certificate
from the mint and other documents te.
tifying to its identity.-Daily Colum
bian.
A Notable Event.
Odd Fellows' day at the exposition
has been officially fixed for September
26. A great programme has been out
lined for this the triennial celebration
of the order. September 25 there will
be a splendid parade of all branches of
the order including the Sovereign
grand lodge and the chevaliers of uni
form rank. The celebration by the
brethren will be supplemented -by one
given by the Daughters of Robekah,
with exercises iqnBeeital hall.

There is a time in the life 4, every
girl and boy when thqyseen tb be all
arms anid legs, lhausdsand feet and are
as sprawling and- ungraceful as one
could imagine. At this time much may
be done by judicious dressing to mod
ify theirphort-comings, and it is well
to bring them through this period of
embarrassment aqearly as possible.
Girls of fifteen when of medium height
and figure have the dresses just above
the instep. When they are very tall
and mature-looking they are worn
longer; but when they are small and
rather childish, the dresses need not be
so long. This is, however, often a
matter of taste with those who have
charge of their wardrobes.
A very stylish hat for a girl is of
chip. The brim is rather wider than
that of the average sailor and is rolled
up at the back and slightly pinched in
at the sides. The trimming is of loops
of wide ribbon with a few daises, some
black-eyed susans of plain soft bird
wings.
A comfortable and appropriate dress
for a child is a striped gingham with
narrow ruffles at the hem, full sleeves
with narrow cuffs, a full waist with
turned over collar and a short Zouave
jacket with some pointed trimming or
with gimp edged with little drops.
A pretty English dress for a girl of
fourteen is of cashmere in the color
most becoming. It is made with
straight skirt and round waist with
leg-o'-mutton sleeves. A yoke and
shoulder ruffles With shirred belt are
of soft bengaline, surah or ottoman
silk.
The new colors in duck and pique
make very desirable dresses for girls of
all ages. The come in tan, blue and
white and various mixtures. White is
among the favorites, but is usually re
served for more dressy wear.
The people who are able to buy the
best goods, those of them at least who
are considered as entitled to the de
signation of laders of society, dress
their girls in the plainest fashion.
There is nothing more becoming to a
growing girl, who may be somewhat
angular and possibly a trifle awkward
in her movements, than the soft blouse
and jacket.
Girls of twelve and thirteen years
wear chally, gingham and similar cot
ton goods, and for traveling or mount
ain wear, flannel, serge or medium
weight camels'-hair.
Skirts of medium-weight wool mate
rial with shirred waists of cheviot or
blouses of surah or any of the pretty
cambrics are much -liked.
Tiny girls may be picturesque and
fluffy-looking, but it is much better for
growing girls to be dressed in the sim
plest fashion.
Girls wear hair-ribbons matching the
leading color in the dress. It is also
well to have the ribbon on the hat to
match.
Growing girls, quite as much as their
grown-up sisters, need have special at
tention paid to harmony in color.
Quill-feathers, wings and small birds
are among the most popular hat and
bonnet trimmings.
Blrowns of all shades end blue and
green in the darker hues are preferred
for street wear for girls.-N. Y.

"Auus
Flower"
I have been troubled with dyspep
sia, but after a fair trial of August
Flower, am freed from the vexatious
trouble-J. B. Young, Daughters
College, Harrodsburg, Ky. ,I had
headache one year steady. One bottle
of August Flower cured me. It was
positively worth one hundred dollars
to me-J. W. Smith, P.1M. and Gen.
Merchant, Townsend, Out. I have
used it myself for constipation and
dyspepsia and it cured me, It is the
best seller I ever handled-C. Rugh,
