The local committee on arrange
ments for the State Agricultural
Convention is doing some excel
lent work in advertising and pre
paring for the meeting which will
begin at this place next Wednes
day. A big welcome and a profi
table time is in store for all who
attend.
A painful accident occurred on
our streets last Friday. Master
Clyde Levy was handling a small
rifle rather carelessly when he dis
charged it at little Pearl, d(laughter
of Mr. Geo. W. Adams, the ball
passing through her wrist, inflict
ing a painful but not serious
wound. Many such accidents have
terminated with fatal results, and
parents can't be too careful in al
lowing their children the use of
firearms.
Mr. E. J. Gamble of this city
attended the Cotton Grower's meet
ing at Shreveport this week. He
is one of the most untiring work
era in the interest of the farmers of
his parish and state. But come to
*think of it their interests are indi
rectly his and he is only exercising
good judgment rather than philan
thropy. __ _

Police Jury.
In their election of officers for
the ensuing year the police jury at
their recent session selected a gen-ll
tlenman (Mr. T. F. Porter) living
some three miles from town, for
clerk of their body. We thought
at the time the selection was a bad
one, on account of the distance
from town. whatever might be his
qualifications, but since that time
a number of men have already
been put to a great inconvenience
and somie expense to lunt this of
ticer lip to transact the business of
his office with him.
On last Monday, several gentle
Wmen, somei of them coming, _o
miles to town, had to go 3 miles
above here to transact business
which every reasonallce man ex
pects to be done at the courthouse.
This is not right, and the police ju
ry at their next session should
takeC this burden and expense off
their people.
And while on that subject, we
might remind them that though
Mr. Porter is doubtless well quali
tied for the position, it does not
look well to have one man for par
islh treasurer andia his brother fir
clerk of thie polite jury, as the
clerk is, or ought to be the auditor
of the parish funds.
It seems to us that there are plen
ty of mcen right here in this town,
and that too outside the Porter
family, who could possibly fill
the position of clerk. In fact,
we never heard any compllaint
against Mr. Fleaming, the old clerk.
Our intelligent but wayward
police jury acknowledged the man
ifest injustice of their effort to en
force prohibition on April 1st next
(nine months before licences had
expired), by rescinding that part
of their ordinance on Thursday
morning, which was after our ar
ticle censuring them for it was in
press. We now ask an indulgent
public to give them all the credit
that is due them for retracting that
which nearly everyone joined us in
saying was wrong.
We have been told that they did
not relish our strictures of last
week, but they did not mend the
matter much Oby reccinding what
we had condemned and thus prov
ing that we were right.
We simply thought their action
showed an over zealousness in the
cause that was not warranted by
the exigencies of the situation and
for which we could account only
as we did. If we did them an in
justice they must take comfort in
the fact that public officers are le
gitimate subjects of pubhc criti
cism, and the most desirable part
of an office is the salary.
Suppose a town of 1,000 people,
more or less, was to be deprived of
every piece of money. They might
have business running, stocks of
goods, and all the things in a well
regulatedl community-but no mon
ey. Everything would stop. A
man could not buy a box of match
es, even if he had lots of property,
forl he could not pay for it. Men
would be discharged, factorise
closed, merchants baakrnpt (if
they were in debt at all), and mis
erywould be every present, be
cause the people could not trade as
before. All the wealth-food,
clothing and raw material-would
tb theru, bat they could not do
bnusiness-that is, if they were like
oar people. If tlhey knew enough
they would meet and devise some
script and estabMlh trade, but if
thbey believed nothing but gold or
liver waMld do they would starve.
Ilt thaisconditioua man with a
little money should go to that towrn
be wouald be bhailed with delight
sad could boy property at his own
price. But if be were wise he
would mtablishba ah, Isse his
promises to pay, loan tem to the
pe .sad soon get aD the proper
