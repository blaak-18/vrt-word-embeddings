1$ Trice's Landing the Flood Con
tinues to Pour Through the ('re
vasse and the Rush of the
Water Is Terrific.
Memphis. March 20.-It is believed
t'.at the rtrt of the Mississip i ricer
flood has reas"'.e! Yemphis anl tha;t a
fall will begin within less than twenty
four hours. However, the conlitions
that exist above Memphis with the
gap In the levee at Trice's Landing.
Ark., make- it a most difficulk and un
certain matter to forecast what is
likely to occur in the flood situation.
The gauge Thursday night showed 40
feet and stationary, a rise of two
tenths in twenty-four hours.
While-the crevasse has not widened
to any appreciable degree, the levee
is overtopped a short distanc further
to the north and the flooded Missis
sippi is discharging much water at
both this point and at the crevasse.
A difference of between four and five
feet exists in the height of the water
on either aide of the levee at the crev
asse, and the rush of water through
the opening is terrifid. The St. Fran
cis levee board made a second effort
to send the tug Diana and a barge
through the crevasse to assist in res
cuing people and livestock in 4rkan
sas. The Diana and the government
steamer Abbot went to the crevasse
with the purpose' fully formed of send
ing the tug through in charge of Cap-i
tain Fogleman, who had volunteered
for the dangerous work. When the
situation was carefully inspected the
idea of putting the tug through the
gap was abandoned, as the fall is so
great and the rush of the water so
strong that it was feared the tug
could not-safely pass through. About
100 yards west of the levee there is a
belt of heavy timber and the current
sweeps against the large trees with
force sufficient to make them sway
with violence. This condition made it
most probable that the tug would be
swept into the timber by the force of
the current and disabled or even over
turned. These and other unfavorable
conditions make it impossible to ease
the tug through with cables as was
contemplated, and consequently the
task has been abandoned for the pres
ent at least.
. A special to the Commercial-Appeal
from Marion, Ark., received at a late
hour Thursday night, tells of great
havoc by the flood at that point, and
says that such extremetles have been
reached by the people there, that it
was decided at a conference of prom
inent citizens to dynamite the levee
at once at Mound City, Ark., unless
the St. Francis levee board sent a
rescue boat through the break at
Trice's landing at once.
Water is running, eight feet deep
through very street of the town with
fearful force, and a rapid rise is in
progress. Twenty white persons of lo
cal families are quartered in the sec
ond story of the courthouse, and fully
200 negroes, many without food are
penned up in various buildings of the
Village. Several hundred head of
stock, without sufficient food, are on
platforms in tha village and the first
story of all -houses are under water.
The Frisco railroad tracks are cover
ed and washed for six miles, and a
handcar, bearing General Manager B.
L. Winchell, was put through from
the west with·'the greatest difficulty,
and grave risk. Mr. Winchell stated
that he saw no hope of opening the
line throught to Memphis foP at least
a week after the water shall recede.
Sheriff Williamson of Crittenden
county and other prominent citizens,
attended the meeting at which it was
decided to dynamite the levee. The
citizens -have sufficient of the explos

where the private levee was overtop
ped last week, the water pouring in,
washing away the levee and flooding
the western end of Jefferson county.
Nothing can be done with the levee
there and planters must wait until
the river goes down. About four hen
dred head of stock were brought down
from Ashlanq and stabled here in
Natchez. A heavy rain began here
Thursday iight.
The inflow from Bougere crevasse
is filling Black river, that river show
-ing a rise of one-tenth at Jonesv!lle
and still rising.
The Betsy Ann came in from Bayou
Sara with another lot of refugees and
stock. She cleared as quickly as pos
asble to get another load. She was
compelled to pass a lot of stock stand
ing in water below Fort Adams, but
the -river will- have swept the stock

The river rose .35 - n the twenty

above the danger line and rising.

GOMPERS APPEALS.

Federation Organizers.
Washiingtosl Marc>. 20.-Samuel
Gompers. president of the American
Federation of Labor, sent the follow
ing trelegram.
Washington, March 19.--Chief of Po
lice. Tampa, Fla.-In the name of or
ganized labor, as well as every liberty
loving citizen, I demand full protection
to cur organizers, James Wood and
James A. Roberts and others whose
lives have been threatened. These
men I know to be law abiding citizens
and w0,uld not be guilty of an unlaw
ful aet. r ciy Lave a right to organize
workingmen and if necessary in de
fense of their rights, to strike for the
cnforcement of them, if no other means
of redress is afforded. The kidnapping
and making way with a number of
Tampa's workmen less than two years
ago wa,'rants belief that the precent
threat is serious and emanates from a
capitalistic organization of banditti.
SAMUEL GOMPERS.
This telegram as sent by Mr. Gom
pers on receipt of statements from the
organizers mentioned that the sub
joined communications had been re
ceived by them:
"Tampa. March, 1903.-James Wood:
You are hereby commanded to leave
the city at once and never return. Our
men have been watching you since
your arrval and- we are convinced
that you are a trouble-maker. Leave
the city and save yourself the* trouble
of our being compelled to remove you
which we will do if you are in the city
24 hours after receiving this letter.
Take your big guard and leave the city
under paid of death, for we will not
have or tolerate any more strikes in
this city. Leave or you die.
"COMMITTEE OF TAMPA AND SUR
ROUNDING COUNTRY."
"Tampa, March. - 1903.-James A.
Roberts: You are hereby commanded
to leave the city at once. You con
spired to bring nigger William back.
You brought Wood here. You are con
spiring with the anarchists in order
to bring on a strike. You brought
them anarchists from Key West to
bring on a strike and we think your
next move for the good of Tampa will
be to leave the city, and if your ever
come back you do so at your own peril.
To remain 24 hours after receiving
this letter means death for both you
and Wood. Get out of the city and
save us the trouble of removing you.
"COMMITTEE OF TAMPA AND SUR
ROUNDING COUNTRY."
Mr. Gompers announced that.he had
been advised that letters similar to
these also were served on Jose Diaz,
Geo. Bristow and Frank Kelly, mem
bers of the Cigar Makers' Internation
al union.
Will Be Protected.
Tampa, Fla., March 20.--Chief of
Police Jones Thursday night received
a lengthy telegram from Samuel Gom
pers, president of the American Feder
ation of Labor, demanding protection

received threatening letters several
weeks ago. Chief Jones answered that
the men will be given all protection
necessary.
CUBAN. TREATY.
Reciprocity Measure Adopted and Senate
Finally Adjonrns.
Washington, March 20.-After rati
fying the Cuban reciprocity treaty the
senate adjourned sine die Thursday
at fifteen minutes past 5 o'clock. Prac
tically the entire day was spent be
hind closed doors in executive session.
Most of the time was devoted to con
sideration of the Cuban treaty. Sev
eral speeches were made in opposition
to the treaty and in favor of it and
then pr6mptly at the agreed hour, 3
o'clock, voting began. Roll calls were
had on a number of amendments and
the treaty itself was made the sub
ject of an eye and no vote. The mo
tion to ratify was adopted by a ballot
of fifty to sixteen, so'mewhat more
than a three-fourths vote, where as
only a two-thirds vote was necessary
to secure a ratification.
Immediately after the doors were
closed a few minutes past 11 o'clock,
Senator Foster of Louisiana took the
floor in order to make a set speech in
opposition to the treaty. He spoke
for about two hours and a half. His'
address had been prepared carefully'
and on its conclusion Mr. Foster very
generally was cqmplimented on his
manner of presenting the opposition
view to the treaty. In the main his
speech wah an appeal for the protec
tion of the American sugar producing
industry.
Senator Allison and Cockrell were
alppointed a committee to visit the
white house and notify the president
the senate was ready to adjourn if he
had nothing further to communicate.

whereupon sine die adjournment was
taken.

SYSTEM OF SUCCESSION.
\Vhen it comes to endorsing the thor
oughness, efficiency and honesty with
which our State government is adminis
tered, T'.e Felicianas is an administra
tion organ. When it comes to opposing
the idea or principle of an administra
tion endeavoring to perpetuate itself, or
name its successors, or to throw the
weight and power of its influence in op
position to a free and untrammeled
choice of the people, then it is anti
administration.-The Felicianas.
The "free and untrammeled choice of
the people" is a delusion. The people
have been "snared" so often until they
have about lost all energy of resistance.
In no State of the Union is there such
autocracy maintained in the name of
Democracy. This condition, however,
will continue until the Democracy, the
Democrats who vote, shall resist and
overthrow the outrageous system of suc
cession.
THE LOUISIANA DEMOCRACY.
The Felicianas, published at Jackson,
La., says: "Louisiana Democracy re
minds one o fa certain game of poker
that a novice participated in, being as
sured that it was only a friendly, so
ciable (?) game among gentlemen. He
helds threes, fours, straights, flushes. s 1
dom less than a full hand-but was in
variably beaten. Finally, when his ring,
watch, and every other asset had fol
lowed his cash, he exclaimed, with a
voice filled with emomtion: 'Gentlemen
-if you are gentlemen-you hold some
of the ------ hands of any set of gen
tlemen I ever played with.'
"With a high tariff delegation in Con
gress--with old reconstruction methods
designed to disfranchise Republican ne
groes rammed down the throats of its
members-with a disfranchised Republi
can negro population included in the
basis of representation for white Demo
cratic conventions-without the right of
a primary voice in the selection of offi
cials-we can truly say: 'Gentlemen, if
you are Democrats, you have some of
the - methods of any Democrats
we know."

"QUITE ENOUGH OF BRYAN."
"It must be evident to the supporters
of William Jennings Bryan-the writer
was one of them in the campaigns of
I89g5 and 19oo-that the Nebraskan has
developed into a political marplot and
nuisance, of whom the country is grow
ing awfully tired. The Bryan of today is
riot thie Bryan of eight years ago. Then
he was a man of gentle temper and per
fect self-possession, but having been
beaten in two presidential elections he
has become 'a man with a grievance' and
an insatiate appetite for revenge. He be
lieves, or pretends to believe, that every
man who did not blindly follow his
financial theory should be driven out of
the Democratic party, especially Grover
Cleveland, and those closely associated
with the ex-president."
"As we have already remarked, the
Democratic party is getting tired of Mr.
Bryan and his deliberate mischief mak
ing, and it is to be hoped that when the.
next Democratic National Convention is
held he will be dumped overboard and
given an opportunity to 'organize a party
for his exclusive use.' It is as certain as
anything can be that the Democratic
party has quite enough of Mr. Bryan,
that its 'exclusive use' by him is no long
er possible. He is now engaged in unak
ing trouble for the Democracy that has
twice honored him, but in the end we are
quite sure the trouble will roost at his
own doors. The Bryan party of 1904 will
neither be formidable nor frightening."
New Orleans States.
QUITE ENOUGH OF CLEVELAND.
In the same time and temper, as indi
cated by the excerpts from the New Or
leans, we may say that it is quite evident
that the Democratic party, the six mil
lion and more of Democrats who op
posed the Cleveland-McKinley combine
and were steadfast. to Bryan and the
platform of the party, are getting tired
of Mr. Cleveland. and it is about time he
was being dumped overboard. The great
body of I)emocrats who fought for Bry
an and I)emocratic principles when
Cleveland sulked and indirectly if not
directly aided and abetted in the suc
cess of McKinley, have no confidence in
Cleveland and who will oppose his lead
ership of the party. We do not think it to
be good policy to belittle Mr. Bryan or
to strive to place him in a false attitude.
Any and every such attempt will only in
cite a retaliatory feeling towards Mr.
Cleveland and the others who, with him,
deserted the IDemocracy in the hour of
need, during the progress of the battle
again_-: McKinleyism when Democracy
had the right to expect the loyal support
of every man who claimed allegiance to
the party. It is not true that Bryan i,
"engaged in msak ng truble for the
Democrac. etc. r c c iHii s.nipl d irecti;:g

the principles of Democracy. have quite
enough of Cleveland.
