BRYAN, PERPETUAL CANDI
DATE.
Who said it would not come? Here
it is:
“I would much prefer to retire to
private life, and I hope that four
years hence circumstances will not be
such as to force me into the cam
paign-; but if circumstances should
force me to battle, battle I will. 1
do not desire ever to be a candidate
for office again; but it is a difficult
matter to make a rule for the fu
ture. If the Democratic party and
contingencies demanded it, I would
again become a candidate.’’
These are the words of Mr. Bryan,
the peerless strategist in the art of
winning defeats, the unrivaled or
ganizer of routs and landslides, the
conquistador of the Never-Never land.
Does the Democracy, that battle-
Bcarred old veteran, think it will es
cape without another fight? Not if
Mr. Bryan knows himself! It shall
not escape so easily. 11 Circum
stances” will force Mr. Bryan to bat
tle, and battle he will; and he will
defeat Democracy again, if it doesn’t
look out. The Democratic party is
one thing that Mr. Bryan can lick,
anyhow. He has subjugated it, and
bitted it, and spurred it, and lar
ruped it to his heart’s content.
Suppose some Democrat like John
Johnson should show signs of vital
ity in 1912. That would be a “cir
cumstance” calling Mr. Bryan to bat
tle. Suppose a good-sized portion of
the Southern Democracy should sug
gest a Southerner for President.
That would be another “circum
stance” acting like a bugle call to
the great Nebraskan, forcing him to
become a candidate. Any incident or
movement tending to extricate the
Democracy from Bryanism is a “cir
cumstance” requiring the perpetual
candidate to stifle his desire for pri
vate life.
There will be plenty of circum
stances. The woods are full of cir
cumstances. Let the Democracy show
the least bit of contrariness, the
slightest desire to throw off its Old
Man of the Sea, and circumstances
will become thicker than blackber
ries, all calling the great Nebraskan
to battle.
Did anybody venture to suggest
that Mr. Bryan was not a candidate
for President? Bah! Mr. Bryan is
alive, is he not? He has his voice,
has he not? Well, then! It was
not necessary for him to announce his
candidacy for 1912. He made the an
nouncement from force of habit. —

RUSKIN.
Ruskin, Tennessee, was founded by
the leading socialists of the United
States. A writer who recently visited
the place gives the following account
of it and the reasons for its failure.
At first the colonists were swindled
by worthless land at a high price, but
this error was corrected by getting
better land and moving the buildings
five miles. Robert Shilling says:
I visited the colony after it had been
in existence some years and I never
met a number of more intelligent,
wide awake and progressive people.
One might say that they were the
pick and flower of the progressive
element of the country. They con
ducted their affairs in the line of
modern socialism, everything being
conducted in common, even the
kitchen and dining room. Their laws
included the initiative, the referen
dum, the recall —in fact, every up-to
date reform.
Yet the conditions existing at
the time were simply horrible. The
membership was 65, but the popula
tion, including women and children,
was 213. The seven original mem
bers with their wives had fourteen
votes. By “judicious” wire pulling
and intriguing these fourteen held
enough additional votes to control the
colony and elect themselves and their
adherents to office and pleasant posi
tions. At the dining room the favor
ites had the best food and the oppo
sition was stinted. The colony held
regular monthly business meetings,
but the arbitrary rule of the ring
caused such continuous and vicious
quarreling that the monthly meetings
were entirely abolished, and only one
meeting a year was held to elect trus
tees, and this board “managed”
things to suit themselves until the
next annual election. Although a
special meeting of the members could
be called at any time, the “opposi
tion” found it useless to call such a
meeting, because the ring would con
trol anyhow.
The working of the model was
worse. Each member was required to
pay an admission fee of SSOO, and
then he could pick out a piece of land,
50 by 100 feet, on which the colony
built a house worth SSO0 —not more,
as a finer house would cause envy
and heartburn on the part of the rest.
One man selected a piece of land and
when spring came, he wanted to raise
vegetables ond flowers on his land, but
found that in his ignorance he had
located on a gravel bed in the creek
bottom that would not grow weeds,
even. He appealed to the trustees to
permit him to cultivate another piece
of land, and though there was plenty
of idle land, the request was refused
on the ground that it was a special
privilege.
One man bought a cow, to have
fresh milk in quantities for his sick
wife. He had to dispose of it, by
order of the trustees, because it was
special privilege. Another asked
leave to buy a goat and was refused
for the same reason. None should
have more than another, though he
was willing to work over time for
the sake of beautifying his home with
flowers and have fresh vegetables.
When, by the admission of addi
tional members, the ring was over
thrown, these people appealed to the
courts and the bubble burst. There
is no longer Ruskin colony.
When the attention of prominent
socialists, Eugene V. Debs among
them, was called to this experience,
their reply was that Ruskin being sur
rounded by the “competitive” sys
tem, it was no criterion of socialism,
tab* 'Stffersonlan
but if socialism were universally in
troduced it would be successful. —Pe-

ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC.
Men who contribute money to buy
votes and to bribe the people’s rep
resentatives, as well as those who
disburse it, are deadly enemies of the
republic. Their greed and love of
power are greater than their love of
country. They impair popular re
spect for law, which is the only safe
guard for life and property, and it
will be an evil day for the nation
when its preservation depends upon
their patriotism and courage. They
may masquerade in the garb of righ
teousness and address the people in
the language of patriotism, but their
virtues are assumed; they are hypo
crites and assassins of liberty, and
would welcome a dynasty rather than
shed their blood in defense of popu
lar government. —Johnston News-Mon
itor.
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
Electoral college, we have ail fall
en in the habit of saying, but each
state has its own college. The col
leges never have a joint meeting. The
whole body of electors never comes to
gether. By the provisions of th3 con
stitution the electors of several states
meet at the state capitals on a speci
fied day and vote by supposedly se
cret ballot for candidates for presi
dent of the United States and vice
president, only one of whom may be a
citizen of the same state as the elect
ors. A list is made of all the votes
cast and this, after it has been signed
by every elector and duly certified, is
sealed in an envelope and sent to the
president of the United States sen
ate. It is one of the constitutional
duties of this officer to open these en
velopes, on a specified day, in the pres
ence of the senate and house of rep
resentatives in joint session. The
elecoral votes are then counted. If
there is no choice, the house of repre
sentatives elects a president. The law
specifies the second Monday in Jan
uary after their appointment as the
day for the meeting of the electoral
colleges. Congress counts the electo
ral vote the second Wednesday in
February.—New York Times.
THE RECLINING ANCIENTS.
We stand and sit too much, accord
ing to the views of Dr. Gelbke in a
lecture before a body of German phy
sicians. Chairs may have been known
to the ancients, but they were used
only on extraordinary occasions. Per
sons of culture as well as the bar
barians took their meals and their rest
reclining. Dr. Kruche of Munich says
that to this day the primitive peopies
prefer the reclining to the sitting pos
ture, and the fact that they lie not
upon the back but upon the stomach
accounts for the better and more sup
ple figures of these people.—London

SOME ‘‘KINDLY BUT FAIR”
WAYS IN WHICH OIL TRUST
TREATED RIVALS.
Here are some of the ways in
which the Standard Oil combination
has “kindly but fairly,” as John D.
Rockefeller says, bought out or
squeezed out its competitors in the
kerosene business. The methods here
described are those testified to under
oath in various proceedings to which
the Standard was a party.
The South Improvement Company
got a rebate from the railroads, not
only on its_jU£n oil, but also on the
oil of other shippers transported by
the roads. In one locality the rail
roads charged all oil shippers $1.50 a
barrel and turned $1.06 of that sum
over to the South Improvement Com
pany. Under this deal the Standard
actually paid 44 cents a barrel freight
and its rivals $1.50 a barrel.
Though the Rockefeller group con
trolled at that time but a small part
of the shipments, they collected as
high as $3,500,000 a year from their
rivals, through the railroads, in the
shape of freight rebates. As early as
1875 nearly all the interior petroleum
refineries had been thus driven out
or forced to sell.
According to the late George Rice,
of Marietta, 0., the Oil Trust ruined
him through a secret agreement with
the railroads by which the trust paid
10 cents freight a barrel while he was
paying 35. The railroads paid 25
cents out of the 35 to the trust.
According to William C. Bishop, of
San Francisco, the Standard got an
“emergency” rate in the Far West
of 90 cents a barrel on oil, as against
$1.25 paid by its rivals.
Charles Wright, of Cobleskill, N.
Y., peddled oil that he bought from
the Standard for eight cents a gallon.
When he bought from the independ
ents for seven cents a gallon, the
Standard sent out its own peddler,
who distributed the oil on Wright’s
route for 5 1-2 cents a gallon.
The Standard forced the Manhat
tan Oil Company to sell out by buying
up the visible supply and boosting the
price so that the rival lost millions in
carrying out its contracts.—N. Y.

GEORGIA’S LOVE FOR POETRY.
The Hon. John Temple Graves, the
Atlanta Lanier, has achieved a person
al and professional triumph in his
own state, and his months of melting
song have not been in vain. Eighty
five votes were cast for him, for in
this case his associate, Mr. Hisgen,
did not count. Thus Georgia shows.
her abiding love for beauty and
poetry.—New York Sun.»
NATURAL VAGRANTS, ALL OF
US.
There has never been a time when
men did not wander from a desire
for a change, a desire to flee from the
monotony of mere existence. There
is a fever in the blood which drives
men to wander, affecting rich and poor
alike; and this is a factor which no
legislation can ever entirely eliminate
in dealing with the true vagrant class.
