Looks Like Fra ud Again.
The trial of Jones vs. Freeman
was had last Friday and Saturday.
The jury was empannelled the
first half day with Albert Hailey,
Foreman. The rulings of the
court were eminently fair, and Mr.
Jones' Att'ys began the introduc
tion of evidence in high spirits.
The ward 3 tally sheets were in
troduced and the court ordered the
box counted in the presence of the
jury.
But in objecting to the filing of
ward 3 tally sheets, Freeman's
lawyers filed the affidavits of Find
Icy and Oliver-not as evidence,
for the plaintiff had not closed and
they could not begin the introduc
tion of testimony--but only in
support of their objection.
They succeeded however in fool
ing the stenographer into puttine
it down as filed in evidence, wheth
er by accident or on purpose--so
far as the lawyers were concerned
it was evidently on purpose, for
they socn after proposed to rest
the case, and Jones' lawyer, think
ing they had introduced no evi
dence against the ward 3 box,
agreed to it, and when the jury
retired to consider the case, they
found the affidavits of Oliver and
Findley in the record as evidence
and undisputed, when of course,
they ,brought in a verdict for
Freeman.
Our lawyers do not propose,
however, to be beaten by such
cheap practice as this, and have
re-opened the case on a motion for
a new trial.
Mr. Freeman has gained all he
had to gain at the outset-a little
more time. He seems to be as
happy over that, however, as if he
was honestly entitled to the office.

Col. NORTON for BRYAN.
The Candidate of the Middle-of-the-road
Populists for President writes a Stong I
Letter to Chairman Butler It has the e
True Ring.
lHe says the election of Bryan is of the supremest importance. And
appeals to every Populist to put patriotism and country above
every other consideration.-He says that Bryan's election is a
triumph for the principles of the People's party ; is a triumph
for American principles, is a triumph over every evil that the
People's party contends against. Let all bickering cease, and let
every patriot.fall in line, touching shoulder to shoulder.-Tremen
dous issues at Stake.-The people's opportunity.
Recently, Senator Butler, Chairman of the People's Party National
Executive Committee, wrote a Letter to Col. S. F. Norton, of Il
linois, whom as the candidate of the Middle-of-the-Road Populists
at St. Louis, for President asking him what he thought was the
duty of every Populist and every patriot in this crucial test. Col,
Norton promptly replihed with a strong and patriotic letter, and
appeals to every Middle-of-the-road Populist to line up for Bryan.
He especially appeals to every honest man not to allow any party
feeling or prejudice to cause him to fail in his duty, when so great
a battle is being waged between the people and the enemies of
good Government. The letter is as follows:
jVAA q J U f VA vr c
Chicogo, Oct. 15, 1896,
' Hon. Marion Butler, Chairman
I People's Party Committee :
Dear Sir :
However much Populist may
have differed at St. Lonin as to the
correct policy to adopt ; however
much some of us may still believe
a that mistakes were made, under
r existing circumstances there is on
ly one course to pursue, and that
e is to loyally and earnestly support
e Mr. Bryan-not so much for the
sake of elevating him to the Presi
e dency, as for the purpose of de
feating what may be appropriate
ly and most expressively termed
Mark Hanna Republicanism. Al
though some of us may regret cer
tain fusion arrangements which
have been made, it is a noticeable
) fact, that no other man in the
) United States is so much troubled
about it as the manager of the Re
) publican campaign. I never reali
) ged before how highly Republicans
) have always "respected" and "hon
o ored" the Populist Party "till it
fused with the Democrats." If
say consolation is needed, howev
er, for this loss of Republican es
) teem it may be found in the tact
Sthat Messrs. Cleveland, Carlisle
) and Palmer have become the loegs
) tees thereof.
Our political allies in this cam
paign may not have treated us as
fairly and justly as they ought, in
the matter of representation of
vice-presidential electors ; and this
seems to be the chief cause of
) complaint, for 1 have yet to meet
) with a Populist, who does not ad
)mit that Mr. Bryan is the ablest
and most fearless champion of re
form principles, that the reformers
themselves have chosen in the last
twenty years. It is an event in
history to find a man, backed by
more than four million voters, who
Sas the patriotism and courage to
) stand up front faced before the
) combined money power of the
world and hurl in their teeth the
burning words of defiane : "You
Sh4l not crucify mankind on a
crois of gold!" Mistakes may have
) beed made and injustice may have
) been done, especially in the south
era states where the lower of the
Populist army is to be found, but
this is not the time to settle ac
counts, adjust wrongs, discuss dif
- ferences or correct mistakes. We
are in the face of the enemy we
Sare upon the field of battle, the
welfare of our country is at stake,
a sacred cause is trembling in the
r balance, our opponents are danger
ously well equipped and thorough
ly organised, and the contest is
f eree and relentless; all personal
e ambitions therefore should be sup
s pressed, all personal grievances
should be forgotten, and all minor
diiferences shold be detferred till
the battle is won or lost. Every
gun should be turned upon tile
, common enemy.
a Whether Mr. Bryan is a Pop
list or not, one tling is absolutely
aerl, every enemy which re
lormers have encountered during
a the last twenty years we fad to
day imong his bitterest an moat re
lentlesse opponents. Every mo
nopohlistic corporation, every op
pressor of labor, every land grab
ber, every trust and combine, eve
ry robber syndicate, every million
air stock jobber, every subsidized
newspaper, every well-paid corpo
ration lawyer, every millionaire
coal baron, every shylock creditor
and every plunderer of the world's
wealth-producers-all of these old
time enemies whom reformers have
met on so many battlefields, are
to-day Mr. Bryan's enemies. If
they are his enemies he must be
our friend. His success is their
defeat; their defeat is our victory.
We the pioneer workers, have
all fondly hoped that we might
have the satisfaction and the glory
of carrying to victory the time
honored and battle-scarred flag of
reform which the old guard has
held aloft so bravely and heroically 1
all these long and trying years,
and anxious solicitude as to the
outcome may be excusable. But
let us not be unnecessarily alarm
ed about the future of the reform
movement. It has passed the dan- I
ter-point. It is capable of taking
care of itself under any and all
circumstances Traitors cannot be
try it; time-servers cannot sell it
out; injudicious friends cannot
destroy it; defeat cannot demoral
ise it ; its opponents, however pow
erful and crafty, cannot crush it ;
even the gates of bell cannot pre
vail against it. For twenty years,
although subjected to all the dan
gerous pitfalls, perils and quick
sands incident to the development
of a new party, it has grown to be
the greatest factor in the arena of
American politics to-day. And,
if eleeted, I believe that Mr. Bry
an will not be slow to recognise
this fact, and that he will soon
learn to rely upon the counsels and
support of the new party which
has revolutionized the politics of
the country, forced to the front
new and vital issues and made it
possible for the people instead of
offioe-seeking politicians to place a
champion of progressive ideas at
the head of the government. I
believe that he will appreciate the
fact that we have placed in the
hollow of his hand, not only the
unselflsh hopes and patriotic aspi
rations of the Populist party but
the most macred cause that was
ever entrusted to living man, sad
that he will not betray the trust.
In conclusion, permit me to say
that if my twenty years of work
entitles me to the confkleae of my
co-workers let me ask them to lay
aside every other consideration and
help elect Mr. Bryan-not for his
sake, but for the sake of the prip
ciples which we all hold dear and
sacred. If success is achieved the
Populist party can never be deni
ed the glory of the victory. If
defeat awaits us, and our standard
bearer falls let there he no Popu
list arrows found either in his
breast or intis back. Let tbe res
ponsibility rest upon other should
ers than our own.
Sincerely yours,
S. F. Noroes.

We notice that N. A. Dunning
is out in an appeal to Populists

in what way is hardly clear.
The last we heard from Watson
he was urging the support of Wm.
J. Bryan.
But this man Dunning winds up
by saying that he intends to vote
for McKinley, and that tells the
tale of how he came to have tl a
money to do such a purely patri
