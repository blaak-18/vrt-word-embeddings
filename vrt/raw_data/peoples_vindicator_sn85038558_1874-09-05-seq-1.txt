Will Kellogg Resign.
We heard a very startling report on
the streets yesterday, and experaced
such a thrill of delight in listening
thereto that we cannot refrain from
pernlitting our readers to share our
pleasure.
We were gravely told that there
was a movement on foot, the object
of which was to induce Mir. Kellogg
to resign his position as de facto Ex
ecotive, a position which he usurped,
anltd which he has so flagrantly die
I graced and the duties of which he has
I administered with so little discretion
and judgmenlt as to plunge the State
into virtual bankruptcy.
This movement, we are assured,
had its inception among our very best
and most conservative citizens and
tax payers, members of wealthy and
respectable mercantile firms, presi
dents of banks, insurance companies
and other corporations, and that it
has been brought about not only by
the fact that Mr. Kellogg is. distaste
fuil to the people by reason of his hav
ing usurped a position to which an
oh ther was elected, but by reasan of
' the disasters which the usurpation
has brought upon the State au:l city,
- and the ruinous effect which it has
", had upon the credit bf the State.
Boeads, that even under the Warmnoth
administration brought, readily, eigh
ty cents in the New York mmarket, to
ea, day are shunned by capitalists at 20
and even 15 cents on the dollar. He
hasplaced over the people Ip the par
ishes a set of thieves and low: fellows
who have plundered right and left in
the most barefacted and shockisg inap-.
ner, and so far 'froni restoring peace,
and quiet has really been the cause
of most of the trouble in the country,
and in one notable instance was the
prilme mover in a dreadful riot in
which numbers both whlite and black
were killed. He has failed to iilspire
confidence in anybody and stands to
day dete~ted by the more decent men
, in his own party as well as bythe
Swhole 'white population.
. He lobbies lhroigh his mongiel
Legislature, acts which are oppressive
- and outrageous, and which never can
Sgain the sanction of the people. He
has, in short, exhibited neach a mark
ed incapacity for the office and de
veloped so many objectionable traits, l
and has succeeded in so brief a time
in making Louisiana a byword and
reproach, not only among the States
of the Union, but abroad, that we
conceive there can be no impropriety
in asking him in the name of the peo
pie to "step down and out.n
The admirable results which have'
attended the action of the people in '
the parishes, and the readiness with
which the objectionable'ofticials hitve
handed in their resignations, leads as t
to hope that Kellogg will follow the t
excellent examples set' him by his
own subordinates, and yield a cheer
ful acquiescence to the v rv reason
able demand for his resigantion, when
it shall be presented.
The absence of ,eBveral promipent '
men from the city 'at this tBnie is t
thought to bhe significant. Sonieiave
pgne to Washinglton 'to bolster tip
Kellogg, while others bhave go to
show the ruin he has wrought and
the ablsolnte'netessity fir a change.

the advisability of asking not Qomly

How President Grant Performs
Id, His Duties.
!d (Prom the Washigtoa Capital.I
, We questioned a gentleman who is
fl on familiar terms with Gen.. Grant as
es to how this intellectual personage
it managed to put in his time. Our
by friend replied slowly, as if trying to
. remember between sentences :
"Well, lie rises about 9 and smokes.
n- Then he breakfasts and smokes. Af
of ter, his secretary opens his mail; and
)D the President smokes."
, "Does he ever read the papers ?"
as "Oh, no; his secretary reads them
e. and when he sees at passage or para
tl graph likely to interest the President
li- he marks it, The fles thus marked
o- the Presidedt sonetimes- looks into,
but he seldou l gets beyond one, and
le thishe does not kbeep long unless it
r- happens to be a sporting journal. Af
vs ter this iutellectual effort he has via- i
in stors."
''"And ,the President listens and
e smokes t '
, "He smokes certainly ; but there is
a popular delusion anent that silence.
l Among his iqtimate friends and tiuui
in ly he talks incessantly-that is, if the
lk subject is n::t Iilitical. When p11
ities are touched he suddenly grows
. reserved and sinks intosilence." I
"And after i"
Is "Well, tlhu comes an early dinner I
and more smoking. After dinner I

e "Why, does he give no time to af
, faire of thne government t"
My dear'riUend; he gives air his
e time here, as in Washington, to Gov
ernment matters. This is done by
" talking. Our Government is carried
on through talk, in a social, pleasana t
Sway. Every man, and sometimes the
n woman, Itas an office to be got, either
for himself or fridod. That is Gov- e
e erument business, and hie or she talks
i it at the President. Or there is a con
tract in question. This is Govern- t
iment bustnees of course."
"And so we pay a hundred thiens.
and dollarsa year directly and indi
rectly, to have a man talk politics.
However, that is a very inoffensive j
t sort of a way to put in the time. How

Is the North 1ntera3tad.
We copy the following from the
New York Sus, which is a full answer
to the question, whether the North is
anxious for us to have a good, honest,
capable government in the South :
The people at the North may im
agine that they are not sufferers by
the atrocious robberies which have
been perpetrated upon the people of
the reconstructed States by the hlu
man vultures who' have represented
the Administration there, receiving
the support and encouragement of
President Grant; but if they think so
they are greatly mistaken, for one
part of the United States cannot be
brought to ruin by misgovernment
and excessive taxation without the
rest of the country suffering thereby
in many ways. There are many
manufacturing cities and towns in
the Northern States whose future
prosperity largely depends upon a
restoration of the Southern trade
which formerly gave employtient to
numerous mechantic and flactory ope
ratives, but which has been greatly
decreased or entirely lost, owing to
the impoverished condition of the I
Southlern people. Millions of dollars
in Southern Stpte bonds are held by
Northern capitalists. which yil;ld no
income because the funds of these
States have been stolen to enrich
corrupt politiciaus. And failure of
such States to meet the inutrest on
their bonds held in Europe is proving
ruinous to American credit abroad.
The present scarcity of money
throughout the country is owing, not
to a lack of currency sufBicient to t
meet legitimate demnands, but to the
fact that the management of public i
affairs in Washington, and in most
of the Southern States, has been cor
rupt and inefficient, the great aim of
those intrusted with the highest pow
era, having apparently been to accu
mulate wealth for themselves, their I
relatives and thleir personal friends,
regardless of the interests of they,ieo
pleat large. In order to afford ille
gal gains to comparatively a few per
sons, the whole country is exhOrbi
tautly taxed, and its best interests
are mercilessly sacrificed.
Confide in Your Children,
In American society there is an I
amazing separation of old people
from young. It comes, as we believe,
of the lack of family intimacy be
tween the old and yqung. To most
parents children are incapable crea
tures, to be taught, provided for, rul
ed, disciplined, mentally condescend
ed to, from babyhood to that aston
ished morning when they discover I
that the babies are young men and
women in whose plan of existence '
they have little vital part. The moth
er buys the daughtes's handkerchiefs
and pins, up to the time her troussea
is hmeeded. The father decides all t
questions for his boy till the 'boy is
ready to leave the home roof. oy t
and girl go outside the household for a
their intimates and their. interests.
They are not expected to bear their
part in the entertainment of guests or
cast a vote in the household commit
tee of ways and means. The deep
social questiou of the time, she does
not discuss with her daughter. T'he
issues oif war and peace, of politiei, t
of hard tinra, private st raits or pub- a
lie dangers, the father talks over with
his st4ipid neighbor, but not with his
quick-witted, eager smos. Not i.ak
ilg their children their companions '
and'friends, parents are yet smitten C
with pain and hitter sense of Ingrati- .
tede, when they find that their holdl- '
dren, young men and women, do not a
care to make companions and friends ti
of them. Perhaps this parental re- d
serve is a legacy of the stern puritan
days, when the parental silee msmd
authority were so sagnilied that the

r If the land is plowed near large fruiti
trees the plow should be adjuted to
run only a few inches deep. The
, ost plausible argument that can be
advanced against the practice ,f
plowing the ground arouad fruit tree,
of any kind is the fact that evezy
tree will send out a system of coruon
al roots just beneath the surface of
the soil, whichwill again throw *.ut
1 branch rootlets in a horizontal dizec
tion, all of which will continue t.o
f multiply until the entire surface of
the ground is completely occupied
with open mouths of hungry rootlets,
ready to drink in the first supply of
t nourishment that is dissolved by the
falling showers. It is as muuch a
legitimate habit of a fruit tree to
provide a close network of roots near
the suffice of the ground as it is to
send other roots downward into the
earth. Every fruit tree, most decid
uous oruamental and timber trees,
Sas well as evergreens of all kinds,
when growing on dry upland, will
send down a long tap-root, for the
purpose of reaching moisture to sup.
ply the growing branches during a
dry period in the growing season.
Let the tap,-root be removed, and the
tree will make but slow growth, be
cause its habit has been interfered
with. The same is truite touching the
,upper system of coronal or secondary
roots near the surlface of. the ground.
These are what are 'ronperly called the
fieeder of tlhe parent stein. They
should not be antilated nor remov
ed, as they usually are cut off and
turu away by the plow. All vegeta
tion should be kept down around
fruit trees as fair from the body as
th e extremity of the longest branches
by hoeing the surf ce over frequently,
or by the application of a few inches
in depth of a mulchh. Fruit trees
maiv bear \well when cvery coronal
root has been removed with the
plow; but if those roots had not
been removed the crop of fruit would
have been more abundant.--New
York Paper.
SHOULD HORSES WAR BLINDERS
We never could see ' ahat vice or de
formity lay in a horse's ey4 that
should make it necessary to cover it
up, and shut out its owner from at
least two-thirds of its rightful field of
vision. The poets say that old ago
looks backward; but we never heard
such an idiosyncrasy charged upon
the horse. The theory that a horse
is less apt to be frightened when shut
out from everything behind him, we
suspect to be a fallacy, else saddle.
horses and war-horses would be duly
blinded. Every horse is as familiar
fith his own carriage as with his owua
tail. and, as far as his "personal"
fortitude is coneerned, is no more
disturbed at being persued by one
than by the other. As for the other
scare-crows th;at come up behind,
they are mostly so familiar to the
animal, that, the more fully the horse
can perceive them, the more quietly
does ,he. submit to their approach.
Then it is such a pity to ove~ eup one
of the most brilliant features of this
most brilliant creature. The horse
has borne such a hand in the civili
zation ofthis rgh-and.tumble world,
that it seems not so mnosh a etruelty as
a dliIcorurtesy, as well as adisgrace,
to hide his form with emlbarrassing
toggery. No wonder we estimate the

Wonder the Roeinus and the Germane,
