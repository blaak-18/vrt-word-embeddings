The K-K-K in its Relation to the Church
To the uninformed church men and
women who have not taken particular
pains and made special effort to know
and understand the Ku Klux Klan in
its true and real makeup and pur
pose, there is ever present the ques
tion as to what the relation of this
so grossly misunderstood organiza
tion is to the church of Jesus Christ.
And, because of ignorance of the
principles and workings of the or
ganization, too often they conclude
that it is hostile or opposed to the
real spirit of the church itself. Hence,
there is ever being asked such ques
tions as, “Does it not try to displace
the church?” “Are the things it
stands for not un-Christian, and,
therefore, to be condemned by the
church?” “Is it not a fact that its
membership is largely made up of
that class and type of men who
neither go to or support the church?”
“Does it r.ot inject into the church a
spirit of hatred for certain races and
classes of people, and, therefore,
make of no effect the commandment
of Jesus when he says, ‘Love thy
neighbor? ” etc.
Klan a Movement of God
On the other hand those churchmen
and women who are in full touch with
this wonderful movement, for it is a
movement and a movement of God
for the bringing of righteousness to
America in all the various phases of
her life, fail to understand how the
great church of the living God can
be so slow to grasp such a wonderful
opportunity for the bringing the king
dom of God here on earth.
For ages we have been sending up
our plea that somehow God would
make His will to be done here on
earth as it is done in heaven. But
when we stop to note the too an
tagonistic attitude of the Protestant
churches toward the Ku Klux Klan,
we are sometimes made to ask our
selves the question, “Is it not true
that after all, we want God to do the
thing, but do it in the way and by the
tactics that most appeal to us?” In
other words, we fear it is too often,
“Thy kingdom come, but come in our
way.”
We Must Reckon Well
History makes known to us one
great truth with which we must
reckon and reckon well. That is that
all through the ages when a people
or a nation have swung too far from
the things of right, God has raised
up a great man or movement, or
both, by which He has been able to
work out His will in His way. To
the informed man or woman, and by
informed we mean those informed on
the subject on which we are writing,
the Ku Klux Klan is a mighty move
ment, born of God for the redeeming
of the whole life of America. And
that America needs a cleaning is tod
well known by the student of her po
litical, social, religious and educa
tional life, of the present time.
Our Purpose
It shall be our purpose, then, in
this article to state clearly, if we can,
some of the things for which this
great organization is standing and
for which it came into existence. We
are not ignorant of the fact that any
thing which we may have to say will
be of little value to any man or
woman except those who are willing
to lay aside their prejudices and face
facts just as they are, whether those
facts are pleasing or not. Any other
class of individuals is not only hope
less, but dangerous as well. Knowl
edge is a composition of facts, and
facts are to be had by an open mind
only. The facts stated in this ar
ticle are given in the hope that they
may help compose a true knowledge
for some open-minded folks, who,
when they have obtained the truth,
will by it be made free from the mis
representations and malicious false
hoods that have caused them to take
a wrong attitude toward he greatest
organization, outside of the church
itself, that was ever formed under
the Stars and Stripes for righteous
Americanism.
Studied Klan Carefully
Over six years ago the writer be
gan a study of the Klan, and through
all the following years has been in
close touch with the various move
ments of same. We have also taken
careful pains to follow the daily
newspapers in their reports from
time to time that we might ascer
tain whether the reported misdoings
of the “Hooded Men” were based on
truth or falsehood, or a malicious
purpose. Our attitude all along has
been, what can be found out as truth
about this mysterious Klan must be
the ond thing which shall pass judg
ment upon it. We feel sure, then, we
are fair in all our considerations if
we are willing to apply this test to
the Klan as it relates itself to the
church.
We must needs consider some very
essential questions and determine
what the correct answer to them is if
we would speak with any degree of
certainty. This we all shall do, en
deavoring to leave the reader to form
his own conclusions then, as to the
value of an organization like this for
a time such as this.
Moody's Standard
Mr. Moody had one standard by
which he tested everything that re-
lated itself in any way to his life or
conduct. That was the one question,
“Is it right?’ If he could satisfy
himself it was right, no matter what
it was, he had a place for it in his
life experience and gave it his sup
port. Can we use a better standard
in applying our test to the Klan, es
pecially as it relates itself to the
church? If we can determine wheth
er it is right then I feel sure we have
decided sure what its relation to the
church ought to be at least. Or bet
ter said what the relation of the Pro
testant church to it ought to be. The
only test to use in determining the
right or wrong of anything or indi
vidual is, what are they doing? For
“can a bitter fountain give forth
sweet water?” We feel the church
might, with very great profit to it
self, read again that passage in Mark
9:38-10, and remember that Jesus
said to his disciples, “He that is not
against us is in our part.” No indi
vidual enlightened on the subject of
the Ku Klux Klan can truthfully
maintain that it is in anyway against
the church.
Winning Over the Enemy
When Moses was leading the Israel
ites out of Egypt there came a time
when they were compelled to face the
enemy in the person of King Amalek.
We are told that when Moses held up
his hands the enemy was defeated,
but when he let them drop down the
enemy prevailed. The hands of
Moses became very tired and he was
unable to hold them up longer. Then
it was that Aaron and Hur placed
themselves one on either side of
Moses and held up his hands, and
Israel prevailed, and won over the
enemy.
The Klan does not in any way dis
place the church, neither does it pose
as the church or as doing the work
of the church.
It is here to hold up the hands of
the Protestant church in its mighty
conflict to put to rout the forces of
evil in their deadly effort to destroy
the kingdom of God as it relates it
self to all phases of America’s life.
The time has come when the church
of the living Christ must give a bet
ter account of itself and cut a deeper
gash in the body of sin or God must
needs raise up some other way by
which He can bring His kingdom in
America and through America in the
rest of the world.
Klan Here to Help the Protestant
Church
The Klan is here to help the Pro
testant church to life up Christ so He
can draw all men unto Himself. Not
to be the church, but to be a helper
to the church.
And just how much influence the
Protestant church will have in the
near future in making the world
Christian will, in the opinion of the
writer depend very largely upon to
what extent it opens its arms to this
new God-sent friend and power; and
with an army of men and women,
such as the church has not been able
in a long time, if ever, to muster,
marches forth to battle afraid of
nothing, but sin wherever it is found,
and of nobody but the devil in what
ever individual or institution—re
ligious, political, educational, or
otherwise—he may be hiding like a
skulking pup to bite and poison
America’s life.
God sends opportunity to men and
institutions, but “he will not always
chide,” and there comes a time when
neglected opportunity becomes the
curse of the individual or the insti
tution that neglects it. We believe
this wonderful organization, this
mighty movement of God, is the
church’s supreme opportunity for the
winning of men and women to the
principles of Christ; and through
these men and women injecting them
into the social,, religious, political,
industrial, moral, educational and
family life of America.
When the Church Steps Forward
And when the church has done this
for America then has she stepped for
ward a long stride toward bringing
the rest of the world to the “Foot of
the Cross.” The Protestant church of
today is very much in the same po
sition, in its relation to the world of
sin, as was the young man who stood
with Elisha when surrounded with
the Syrian enemy. All he could see
was the chariots and armies of the
Syrians, the opposing forces.
He was apparently helpless in the
face of such a multitude as he com
pared it with himself and Elisha. But
that great man of God, Elisha, with
a vision so far superior to that of the
average individual, offered this pray
er, “Jehovah, I pray Thee, open the
young man’s eyes, that ho may see.”
Then it was that the young man was
able to see God’s chariots and armies
in the sky and say to himself, with
assurance, “They that are with us
are more than they that are with
them.” So those who have beheld
the hand of God in this movement
must pray as never before, that God
will open the eyes of the Protestant
churches that they may see. Then
they will be able to see the Klan as
the chariots and armies of God to
help them in a time like this when
the armies of sin are marching hard
against them and the kingdom of
By A Minister whom the Devil Hates (St. Paul, Minn.)
God. And when the eyes of the
church are opened it will look upon
this great body of real men and wo
men as united with itself in a com
mon cause and say, “They that are
with us are more than they that are
with them.” And the forces of sin
will begin to move out of America
as never in a long while and the
Protestant church will come into its
own, and God the Father and Christ
the Son will be exalted in all the na
tions of the earth.
The Klan Is Christian
Now our contention is that the
Klan is placing itself to hold up the
hands of the church. It is, therefore,
undoubtedly Christian, and if Chris
tian then right. It is holding up the
handsof the church, in what it be
lieves. The belief of the church is
summarized in the Apostles’ Creed.
Let us note just a few statements
from that creed as we use it. “I
believe in God the Father Almighty.
* * * In Jesus Christ, His only
Son, our Lord. * * * In the
Holy Spirit; In the Holy catholic
(church of God in general) church.
No man dare call these things un-
Christian for they are not. They are
the very incarnation of all that Christ
taught himself. Let us place along
side of these some of the things
gleaned from the creed of a Klans
man, if we may be allowed to call it
a creed. “I believe in the tenants of
the Christian religion; in God—in
Jesus Christ His Son—in the Holy
Spirit and the Bible as the message
of God to man. I believe that every
man owes it to himself, to his family,
his posterity, and his God to ally him
self with some Protestant church.
And that the church should unfalter
ingly stand for the principles of
morality and' justice.”
Klan Is With the Church
If these are un-Christian then the
above are also. But no man dare call
them so lest he place himself in the
same class with those Jews who
called the Christ a man of lies and
misrepresentations and then spit in
His face. Truly can it be said that
so far as its belief is concerned the
Klan is with the church. And let us
add that this organization is almost
daily (and nightly), emphasizing
these mighty truths before more men
and women than is the church itself.
And among these multitudes are men
and women whom the church never
got a chance to reach until through
the Klan they were turned into the
path that leads to the door of the
church. The preacher whose heart
is in this movement is finding an op
portunity to preach to more folks
than he who is opposed. And the
man who, with this God-given op
portunity, fails to drive home the
real gospel message to these men and
women who, through the influence
of this organization, are awakening
to the need of Jesus Christ in their
lives, is falling far below the wond
erful possibilities that have come to
him.
For these folks, for the most part,
are hungry for the gospel that saves
a man and makes him good for some
thing in this world. The church has
eliminated much of the real gospel
and put in something else in its effort
to catch men.
Klan Should Welcome the Klan As a
Helpmeet
The Klan is trying to help the
church beck to Christ in this sense.
Why should it not welcome a help
meet like unto this? No sane man
with a knowledge of the subject and
the real attitude and program of the
Klan can give a reason. He may of
fer an excuse.
The Klan is holding up the hands
of the church in its ideals. What are
the ideals of the Protestant church?
As we think of them we might state
them all in one, and say the ideal of
the church is for all men and women,
the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.
The gospel which the church has
been commissioned to preach is that
man must apply the principles and
teachings of Christ to every act of his
life whether it is political, social or
what. In other words we might state
it in the language of St. Paul when
he wrote to the Corinthian people
that he was determined to know
nothing among them but Jesus Christ.
That is to say that whatever phase
of their life he might touch he must
come unto contact only through ap
plying the principles of Jesus. Now
what is the ideal of the Klan?
Let me give it in the words of one
of the national officers of the organ
ization as he thundered it forth from
the platform where there were
gathered some fifteen thousand peo
ple. “The watch-word of a Klans
man is honor. The one and only
pattern for a Klansman’s life and
conduct is Jesus Christ. Let us em
blazon upon the sky that no man can
be a good Klansman unless he pat
tern his life after ‘The man of Gal
ilee.* And whenever we leave out the
Christian philosophy we no longer
have an organization worthy of real
men. Men, I charge you to affiliate
yourselves with and back up the Prot
estant churches.” . .
Jesus Is the Idtal of the Church
Jesus Christ is the hreal of the
church and His teachings are its gos-
th»,CAIX OrjrBKjKPKTH
pel. The Klan’s watchword is hon
or. Its worshiping place is the Prot
estant church. Its philosophy, is
Christianity. And its pattern and
ideal for life is Jesus Christ. Can any
man charge justly that it is either un-
Christian or undeserving of the
heartiest support and co-operation of
the Protestant churches of America?
If he do sd then must he also charge
the church of wrong ideals and an
unsafe gospel, and stamp St. Paul as
one who preached a gospel which was
incorrect. * >
Let us look now at some of the
ways in which the Klan is seeking to
make these ideals materialize in the
individual and national life of our
country. We hear a great deal about
the large part the church had in mak
ing our country dry. Very few min
isters but what had at least some
voice in the great temperance move
ment because they believed it right
and a part of the business of the
church. The church has done itself
credit in doing so. And since the
eighteenth amendment went into ef
fect we have spent much time and
speech on the subject of law enforce
ment.
No Protestant church that is
American will allow one spoken word
from its pulpit against this amend
ment. We give as our reason that it
is right and a part of our Christian
duty as being loyal to the interests
of the kingdom of Christ.
Where the Klan Stands
What then, are the things the Klan
: s advocating along this same line
and what is it doing? Again let us
look at the principles to which the
Klansm n subscribes:
“Just laws and liberty; the up
holding of the constitution of these
United States; he much needed local
reforms; law and order.”
it is ferreting out the “bootleg
ging joints” and demanding that the
bootlegger be dealt with accordin' to
law, believing that any judge or of
ficer who fails here is untrue to his
oath of office and disloyal to the
American flag.
It is insisting that every officer,
fiom the lowest to the highest, olay
a clean game or be removed from of
fice. And because of its fearless,
clean, Christian and American stand
on these things it has been instru
mental in doing more to clean up
corrupt communities than any other
body of men and women.
Klan Does Not Parade Its Deeds
True you don’t hear all abous it
because it believes in “not letting
your right hand know what your left
hand ish about.” Neither does it
stop to blow a bugle of false notes
every time it does its duty as a Chris
tian and an American organization.
Should the church oppose an organ
ization which is determined to en
force a law which was passed large
ly through its own instrumentality?
In other words, the church passed
this law because it believed in the
protection of the American home and
of American manhood and woman
hood. The Klan is helping to enforce
it because it believes in the honor of
the Protestont church and of the
American nation; and holds that
every man ought to respect that hon
or either voluntarily or by compul
sion.
The church has been making a plea
for bette" moral conditions in our
American life. Denunciations have
come from preacher and layman alike
of the corruptness that has crept into
our homes, our schools and our so
ciety. We deplore many of the con
ditions which we are compelled to
face today and are longing and hop
ing for some means by which we may
right them. Yet in the very face of
the church and its splendid efforts to
combat with these things we find
what were once Christian homes be
coming homes of sin and adultery
through the intrusion of un-Godly
men and women, who pave the way
to the divorce courts for these hus
bands and wives.
Hie American Home
And with much amazement we note
the rapidly increasing number of di
vorce cases in our courts until it is
now claimed that America leads all
other civilized nations in the number
of divorces granted. At the very cor
nerstone of America, the home, where
there ought to be things righteous we
find all kind of corruption, discord
dissention, and things which despoil.
Like a thief in the night has crept
the enemy, a wolf in sheep’s clothing,
into the very fold of the church it
self and stolen that which is, not only
the rock upon which stands the
church, but upon which stands all
that is American, the Holy Bible, un
til today the Protestant church and
beloved America must stand with
heads bowed wih shame as they read,
“Out the back door of the school
houses of four-fifths of America’s
cities has gone the Bible; kicked out
by certain hyphenated citizens.”
And apparently the church has
been as helpless as a babe to either
replace the ousted book or stop the
progress of its disappearance from
an ever-increasing number of our
public schools. The business and
goal of onr public school can be no
better stated than in the words of
Daniel Webster, when speaking of
education: “The feelings are to be
disciplined, the passions are t 0 be
restrained; true and worthy motives
are to be inspired; a profound reli
gious feeling is to be instilled, and a
pure morality inculcated under all
circumstances. All this is comprised
in education.”
With the Bible out and the dance
and other devices of the devil in, ap
parently producing a laxity of moral
and religious standards in our school
life, who dare say the church is not
justified of these things poisonous
and to replace the Bible to its right
ful place in our public school? Tru
ly, “while we slept the enemy came
and sowed tares among the good
seed.”
Society Is Honeycombed With Cor
ruption
One keen observer of the social life
of America has said: “The social
circles of our country have imbibed
so much of the social practices and
customs of nations with less morality
and decency, that it has become hon
eycombed with all kind of corrupt
ness and character-destroying ele
ments.” And on every hand we hear
complaint, and just complaint it is,
of earnest and anxious parents that
they stand in fear all the time lest
their sons or daughters be dragged
down into the cesspool of corrupt so
ciety in which they are almost com
pelled to mingle or be ostracized. Till
the parent problem of today is what
to allow and not allow in dealing
with their children. And the Ameri
can woman today can hardly tread
upon the street of any American city
without being insulted, directly or in
directly, by some moral degenerate
who has neither love nor respect for
things right, decent or American.
The church of Jesus Christ stands
against this type of citizenship and
looks upon all such characters as
being not only dangerdus but a men
ace to our community life, and unsafe
to the principles of righteousness for
which it is standing. Its attitude has
always been, and properly so, that
such persons must be restrained
either by a “new birth” or by law.
And the social task of the church has
been, and still is, to cleanse human
society by directing its course along
the pathway of the Galileean.
The Klan and Church Work For Bet
terment
The church believes all this is a
veritable part of the task of building
the kingdom of God here on earth,
and is included in the gospel of Christ
which it is commissioned to preach.
It will be neither overlooked or
neglected by the true servant of the
Master. No one would be so foolish
as to even venture a suggestion that
the church’s attitude on these things
is un-Christian. What, then, can we
say for the Klan as touching these
things which are so large a part of
the church life and task?
Let us here give you the “Home
Ideal” of the Klan in the words of
one of its national officers as he sent
it out to his workers everywhere. A
man with wonderful vision, a great
heart, a zeal for right, and a true
spirit of love. A man who, we be
lieve “has come to the kingdom for
such a time as this.”
Klan and Tenets of the Christian
Religion
In stating the purpose and ideal of
the Klan he said: “First, and fore
most we are trying to restore the ten
ets of the Christian religion to each
individual. By his we mean the ac
ceptance of Christ and His teachings;
the restoring of the family altar and
a little old fashioned religion.”
What that will do for the home life
in our beloved country we need not
stop to comment upon for well may
we still ask ourselves the question,
when thinking of our homes, “If God
be for us who can be against us?”
Does the church not preach indi
vidual salvation and through the in
dividual the salvation of the masses?
In other words, its text has always
been, “A little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump.” Has it not been the
earnest plea of the church through
pulpit and press alike, that the fam
ily altar be given first place in our
homes as of yore? Has not the song
of the church for more than a quarter
of a century been, “The Old Time
Religion,” and “Faith of Our
Fathers?” Why, then, should it not
welcome a friend and helper with mo
tive so pure, with vision so heaven
ly, with effort so earnest, and with a
purpose "so Christianlike, as the
above.
In the Ku Klux Klan
In the Ku Klux Klan is a great
company of men and women united in
the common cause of the American
home, that somehow it may return to
its Puritanic standard. They are
ready to hold up the hands of the
church in its efforts to defeat the en
emy of our home life. What is the
church going to say to them? Right
at this point it seems to the writer
he lines of he poet are very sugges
tive to the Protestant church of tq
day:
“B think, ere you stumble of what
may B fall,
B true to your self, and B faithful
to all.**
From the earliest time of which the
writer can remember, two things in
particular have been emphasized from
the Protestant pulpit as being an es
sential part of our public schools,
viz.: The principles and teachings of
the Bible for the building of good
moral character. And teachers in
whose lives the pupil might observe
these at work producing manhood
and womanhood. And the church has
been backed in its attitude in these
things by every great American who
has expressed himself along these
lines. It was Theodore Roosevelt who
said: “To every man who faces life
with a real desire to do his part in
everything, I appeal for a study of
the Bible. No book of any kind ever
written has so affected the whole life
of a people.” And in support of the
church’s attitude as to the teacher let
me quote Chas. W. Eliot: “Nobody
knows how to teach morality effect
ually without religion. Exclude reli
gion from education and you leave no
foundation upon which to build a
moral character.” Only the disbe
liever would attempt to claim these
things as un-Christian.
How Klan Corresponds With Church
How, then, does the advocacy of
the Klan correspond with that of the
church here? In one brief statement
we can put a summary of all it holds
along this particular line, viz: The
Stars and Stripes waving from every
school building in America, the Holy
Bible (and the whole Bible), on the
desk of and read in every public
school in America, every teacher in
our public schools a product of our
schools and willing to teach and prac
tice the principles of Christ in the
school room and out of it.
If this be un-Christian or un-
American, the above attitude of the
church and belief of the men quoted
are, too, wrong. If right, then in its
relation tc the church is not the
Klan “like a mighty army moving
with the church of God, marching as
to war” against the foe that is try
ing to destroy the comersone of the
institution where our boys and girls
are moulded for manly and womanly
leadership, “with the cross of Jesus
going on before?”
We feel that the Klan is upholding
the hands of the church here and that
the church ought to welcome it with
an
“Onward, then ye people!
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the Triumph-Song.”
Our Society Then Will Be Fit
In touching the social life of Amer
ica we feel that little more, if any
thing, need to be said in behalf of
this great organization. For when
the things spoken of above are ac
complished our society will be a fit
place and safe for any one, young
or old. And the Klan holds that noth
ing but the principles of the Christ
at work will redeem any society,
American, European or otherwise. So
suffice it to quote just a statement or
two from the principles to which
every true Klansman holds: Protec
tion of our pure womanhood from
those who, through lust or avarice
would destroy it; the closer relation
ship of pure Americanism, and the
much needed local reforms along
every line.”
All this the church has been trying
to promote since its beginning. It is
right that it should and it must if it
would continue o “fulfill its mission
high.” Its hands have been up a long
time in the noble fight. Now the Klan
hqs come to stay. “We will support
your hands till the Syrian of corrupt
society has been put to rout.”
So into hamlet, and city and coun
tryside has gone this new friend of
Christianity and uncovered some of
the cesspools of social corruption and
stench which breed vice, immorality
and crime in these places to justice.
Thus it is making the social deserts
if America in many places to blossom
at- a rose. Here again the Klan is
standing in closest relationship with
ibe church and only helping it with
the accomplishing of its own task
which seems to have become too large
for it, and has too long been delayed
in the doing. Will the church catch
the mighty vision of the Klan and
join hands with it in all of this? This
question the church must answer for
itself. On its answer depends many
things; things so vital that the answ
er must be made carefully, intelli
gently, prayerfully and without haste
or prejudice.
Klan Is Hopeful of the Best
The Klan is hopeful of the best and
patient in its waiting for the church
to grasp the vision of what it is try
ing to put across for Christ and Amer
ica. The attitude of the church so
far has been that of slapping it up
on the one cheek. But the Klan is
still loving enough in its spirit to
“turn the other also” in hopes that
the church may soon see in this new
movement a friend and not an en
emy.
The program of the Klan is to
clean up America. This it hopes to
do by being an instrument in the hand
of God wielded always for right. This
we believe to be in full accord with
the program of the church, and can
and will be done. For:
“How did the world get started son?
Why someone said: ‘lt can’t be done!’
That settled it. The troglodyte
Came out of darkness into light.
‘lt can't be done!’ somebody said,
A nd, lo the green fields gave us bread.
With that taunt ringing in his ears
Has man gone upward through the
years.
You should have seen the mill wheels
run
When someone said: ‘lt can’t be
done!'
'lt can’t be done!’ they said before
A sail put out to sea from shore.
Since world’s remote and dismal
dawn
Those magic words have spurred us
It drove Columbus where the sun
Went redly down: ‘lt can’t be done!’
‘lt can t he done!’ the weakling said,
And lo! the Wrights flew over head
'lt can’t be done!’ is what they cried
When Fulton offered them a ride.
They said it, and Marconi sent
His message through the firmament.
That is the way it happened son;
Praise God for this: ‘lt can’t be
done.’ ”
So we send this article forth in
hopes that we have in some small
way helped some one to see the better
side of this new movement, as the
friend of the church and of all that
is right and American. And to the
Ku Klux Klan we would say:
“Build on and make thy castles high
and fair,
Rising and reaching upward to the
skies;
Listen to voices in the upper air,
Nor lose thy simple faith in mys
teries^
WHY KLAN SUCCEEDS
DESPITE ENEMIES
1— Its members believe in God and
in the tenets of the Christian religion
and that a godless nation can not
long prosper.
2 They believe that a church that
is not founded on the principles of
morality and justice is a mockery to
God and to man.
3 Klansmen maintain that a
church that does not have the wel
fare of the common people at heart
is unworthy.
4 Like all real Americans they be
lieve in the eternal separation of
Church and State.
SNo Klansman can hold allegi
ance to any foreign government, em
peror, king, pope or any other for
eign political or religious power.

to the Stars and Stripes next to his
allegiance to God.

and liberty.

these United States.
9 Klansmen believe that our Free
Public School is the cornerstone of
good government and that those who
are seeking to destroy it are enemies
of our Republic and are unworthy of
citizenship.
10— They fight for freedom
speech.
11— And support a free press un
controlled by political parties or by
religious sects.
12— The organization believes in
law and order.
13— Every real Klansman is a pro
tector of pure womanhood.
14— They assert that laws should
be enacted to prevent the causes of
mob violence.
15— The Klan stands for a closer
relationship of capital and labor.
16— Its members favor the preven
tion of unwarranted strikes by fori
eign labor agitators.
17— Each Klansman believes his
rights in this country are superior to
those of un-naturalized citizens.

COLLEGE PRESIDENT IS
TEORIBLY UPSET
—K-K-K
Crosses Burned Outside University
of Dayton Grounds Worries
Rev. Mr. O’Reilly
—K-K-K
Dayton, Ohio.—“ Students of the
University of Dayton are losing sleep
and getting behind in their studies,
all because of the activities of the
Ku Klux Klan in burning fiery crosses
where they may be seen from the dor
mitories.”
Thus complained the Rev. Bernard
P. O’Reilly, president of the institu
tion, to Chief of Police James H.
Woodward, and he demands that the
police department put an end imme-
diately to the practice.
After the burning of a huge cross
recently, Dayton detectives made an
investigation, but reported they could
find no clues which might reveal the
identity of the participants. How
ever, the Rev. Mr. O’Reilly appar
ently wasn’t satisfied with the report
of the detectives, so he appeared per
sonally before city officials and urged
that immediate action be taken to
discover the identity of the alleged
Klan members.
