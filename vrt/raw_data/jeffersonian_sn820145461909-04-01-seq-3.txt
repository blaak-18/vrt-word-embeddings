WASHINGTON AND NAPOLEON
It is a peculiarity of the human
mind and sensibility, until trained out
of it, to imagine that it is impossible
to pay a compliment to a friend, in
troduce a speaker to an audience, or
worthily describe a departed hero
without drawing upon language and
upon history for the most extravagant
statements. The singer has “never
been equaled,” the preacher “never
surpassed,” the general the “greatest
in the world,” the statesman “infal
lible.” Our numerous editorials in
commendation of the life, character
and services of Abraham Lincoln
ought to convince any reader of The
Christian Advocate that he has no
higher estimate of the patriotism,
abilities and services of Abraham Lin
coln than the writer of these edito
rials. But we have upon our table
at this time, taken from a popular
magazine and quoted with approba
tion in a widely circulated paper, the
assertion that Lincoln was far greater
than Washington, that his judgment
was better, and that his services to
the country were greater; and a con
tribution from a religious journal of
high standing comparing Lincoln to
Christ. Several living persons have
lately been compared to Christ by
their enthusiastic admirers. The gen
eral public knows comparatively little
of Washington. The advocates of a
certain cult have been sedulously en
deavoring for years to lower him in
the estimation of the public, under
the guise of painting “the real”
Washington. In a similar manner
they might lower the standing of Lin
coln or any other notable. There have
been no perfect men, nor are there
any now.
Not long since a writer attempted
to belittle the military genius of
Washington by comparing him with
Napoleon. Those who underrate the
military genius of Washington have
not closely followed his career. No
great general ever had more limited
resources. Napoleon could raise ar
mies of half a million because he had
relatively an immense population from
which to draw. In Washington’s
time the colonies had a population of
but three millions, of whom one sixth
were slaves, and at least one sixth
disaffected toward the movement in
which he was engaged. Napoleon had
all the money he wanted; Washington
had none. Napoleon was himself the
center of a consolidated government,
which, while he reigned, moved with
the precision of clockwork; Washing
ton can hardly be said to have had
any government at all; nevertheless,
he was superior—in combination, in
advancing and retreating, and even in
actual combat —to Cornwallis, Howe
and Clinton; and yet they were Eng
land’s ablest living generals.
Washington was also a great states
man. His views of government were
deep, clear and comprehensive, and
his eight years’ administration of the
new and untried government proves
him the possessor of unsurpassed ex
ecutive ability. The monarchs of Eu
rope were engaged in administering
forms of government of long stand
ing. The channels of operation were
deeply dug, and except in times of
insurrection or revolution the stream
of affairs moved on in the usual di
rection. Napoleon ruled in the spirit
of martial law rather than by civil
government, between which the dif
ference is as great as can well be im
agined. Washington was the admin
istrator of a new government, and
that of a kind, in most particulars,
unlike any which the world had ever
seen —a government also formed in a
time of peace following a long war,
and made by thirteen differing and
jealous states, all of which abounded
in critics, agitators and adventurers.
Napoleon’s character, in comparison
with that of Washington, was~as the
lurid and startling lightning compared
with the light, if not the warmth, of
a noonday sun.
Washington had no ambition for
power or office. He never asked for
an office, civil or military, accepting
every one with unfeigned reluc
tance, and was dragged from his
loved retirement iixto the arduous
cares of public life. Some one has
said that history is like a vast conti
nent, consisting of extensive plains
diversified by many hills, but contain
ing few mountains. The moral char
acter of Washington is one of the
mountains. There is not an instance
in all history analogous to his volun
tary surrender of the power he pos
sessed, and retirement to the shades
of private life, and that when the
country was virtually without a gov
ernment. The Revolution was achieved
and the Commander-in-'C'hief of
the American armies resigned his
commission with all the simplicity of
unfeigned patriotism. Many of the
patriots and statesmen of the Revo
lution regarded a monarchy with fa
vor, and it is beyond question that
Washington was offered a crown by
men whose abilities combined with his
own would have secured it. But the
oauble which seduced Caesar and
ruined Napoleon had no charms for
Washington. The coup d’etat of
Louis Napoleon taught us what a de
signing or ambitious man would have
done. •
It is well known that Washington
was the object of a conspiracy design
ed to destroy his reputation, injure
his influence, and secure his removal
from the position of Commander-in-
Chief. The principals in this con
spiracy were Generals Gates, Mifflin

and Conway. It ignominiously failed,
and their names are covered with op
probrium. General Conway retired
to Philadelphia, and after a time, be
ing as he thought about to die, he
wrote a letter of penitence to Wash
ington, which answers every calumny,
and remains an irrefutable testimo
nial to the greatness of the Father of
his Country:
Philadelphia, July 23, 1778.
Sir: —I find myself just able to
hold the pen during a few tninutes,
and take this opportunity of express
ing my sincere regret for having done,
written or said anything disagreeable
to your Excellency. My career will
soon be over, therefore justice and
truth require me to declare my last
sentiments. You are in my eyes the
great and good man. May you long
enjoy the love, veneration and esteem
of those states whose liberties you
have asserted by your virtues.
Thomas Conway.
The testimony given by Judas to
the character of Christ when he threw
down the thirty pieces of silver and
said, “I have sinned in that I have
betrayed innocent blood,” is in a cer
tain sense more conclusive than that
of the faithful Apostles. Such is the
testimony of the contrite Conway.
A critical inquiry into the relation
of Washington to the Constitution
and form of government under which
he lived will show that it is improba
ble that a constitution would have been
formed at that time, or that, if one
had been formed, it would have been
of the conservative and at the same
time liberal character of that whose
benefits we now enjoy.
The Articles of Confederation made
little provision for the administration
of civil government. The document
contained many defects, and those of
a radical character. It vested the
judicial, executive and legislative func
tions in one body. It gave Congress
power to decide what was necessary
for the public expense, but no power
over the assessment and collection of
taxes.
The practical working of such a
government was fraught with mis
chievous consequences. A treaty of
