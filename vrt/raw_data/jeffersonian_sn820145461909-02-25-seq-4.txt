THE ANSWER TO QUESTION
FOUR.
From Spool to Cloth Room With the
Girls in a Great Cotton Factory.
By Julia Lester Dillon.
VERY seat was filled.
The girls had come troop
ing in by twos and threes,
until the teacher was in a
quandary to know what to
do with them in the brief
night-sesion of one and
one-half hours that was
allowed her for the teach-
ing. But the girls, must be taught.
Classes were formed, the grading
made as accurately as possible; the
spelling classes were assigned seat
work and wrote and studied while the
other classes in arithmetic worked out
their problems on the black-board.
The Night-School had been made
possible by the generosity of the trus
tees of a fund that had been left for
the establishment of schools for the
free education of the mass, before the
state schools provided education for
the mass as well as rhe class. These
trustees now expended this money for
the-instruction of those who were pre
vented by their daily occupation from
attending the day-schools. The build
ing was well equipped, was well heat
ed, lighted, and ventilated; and the
girls of that district showed their ap
preciation of the opportunity by the
avidity with which they seized the
chance to attend and the regularity
with which they came —for a season.
The girls were of varied and sun
dry types. There were thirty-five of
them in all, interesting as individuals
and as types. There was the delicate,
refined, gentle-faced girl, with the big
brown eyes, with the soft brown hair
that waved around her piquant face,
intelligence written in every one of
her dainty features, and grace in her
every attitude, a girl who would have
been at home in any gathering. Her
sister, with a mass of the most beau
tiful curling auburn hair, had not yet
realized the seriousness of life, and,
therefore, was a tax on the disciplin
ary powers of the teacher.
Closely allied to her in disposition
was Nancy, the irrepressible, the only
one of the girls who was boy-crazy,
the only one whose motive in coming
to the school was decidedly not to
learn, but to get out with the girls
after dark.
There was Susie and Mattie, girls
who were truly genteel. Refinement
showed in their hands, and faces, in
the care of their hair and the neat
ness of their dress and in the very
tones of their voices. Fully a dozen
of this type were among the number,
and it was indeed a pleasure to be
able to help them to realize them
selves and to open their eyes to some
of the beauties of life, as exemplified
in literature, music, and art.
The two little Moss girls, twelve
and thirteen, were of entirely differ
ent material. Mary it was who came
to the school one night with her hair,
Which was usually of a faded blond
color, dyed until it was of the most
fiery red. On being asked what she
Under The Vine and Fig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
meant by dyeing her hair such a vivid
color, she calmly said, “I got tired
of having such faded, ugly hair, so I
dyed it.” That was all there was to
it with her; but it almost paralyzed
the teacher.
There were young girls who had
never been to school —and there were
women of from twenty to twenty-five,
who were in the same class. One and
all, they were eager to learn and well
behaved, a most attractive set of girls,
in personal appearance and also in
their manners.
Inquiry as to the reason they work
ed in the mill developed the fact that
without exception, it was hard neces
sity that made them toil, not only for
their own daily bread, but in many
instances, for that of their brothers
and sisters, and, in some cases, for
the mothers and fathers as well. They
were happy, care-free, glad to be able
to earn good wages and to carry the
money home to the family. As to the
wages they made, they answered one
night, in answer to the question,
“ Some of us work by the piece, some
by the box, and some by the day.”
In explanation, they said, “When
the cotton is taken from the bale, it
goes to the spinning room, then it is
taken to the spool-room, and lastly
to the cloth-room.”
Those who work in the spool-room,
attend to the filling of the spools, and,
when a box is filled with spools of
thread ready for the cloth-room, they
received eight cents. Some of the girls
who worked in this room had made
as much as $1.60 in a day; but the
average was eighty cents, and some
times the “boss” does not allow them
to work fast; the spools must not be
filled faster than they are needed, and
this cuts down the wages a good deal
at times. The slower workers are
found here.
Those who worked by the piece re
ceived twenty-six cents for a piece,
which is a length of sixty-five yards,
and some days they made as much as
$1.82 in a day. Some of the best and
steadiest workers made regularly $1.50
a day, and the average wage was from
$5.00 to $9.00 a week. They also re
ceive five per cent additional for elev
en days work in two weeks, and six
per cent for twelve days work. But,
only one girl had ever received the
six per cent bonus.
This is a striking illustration of the
irresponsibility of the mill population
as a class. They stay away from work
on the least excuse. A headache, a
sore finger, anything that would not
be considered enough to stop a ste
nographer for five minutes, is a sig
nal for them to knock-off. The mills
have no redress, and the girls know
it. They need all the workers they can
get, and, if a girl is “fired” by one
superintendent, she can easily find
work in another mill in another part
of the city. This makes them inde
pendent, ifnd, with their care-free dis
positions and sufficient-unto-the-day
is-the-food-and-drink-and-cilothing-we-
have attitude, the mill-owners, super
intendents, and “bosses,” find keep
ing them in order anything but an
easy matter.
They are proud of the money they
make, but are not particularly proud
3e|’fersonian
of the way they make it. Ask them
if they make as much as the girls
who work in the shops down town,
and they will toss their heads, and
snap their eyes, and say: “Well, I
should say so. I make $6.00 every
week, and sometimes more; but those
girls at the laundries and White’s
and Kress’s and the other’ stores are
glad to get $3.00 a week, and none of
them make more than $5.00.”
**Then another put in: “Yes, they
think they are too good to associate
with us, just because we work in the
mill, and they h<ve to be dressed up
all day, while we do hard, rough
work. ’ ’
“Humph, they make me tired the
way they put on airs, so high and
mighty, as if they was too good to
breathe the air with us. Whew,”
and noses will go up and eager as
sent will be given the speaker.
“We may have to go to work ear
lier in the morning than they do, but
we get off every Saturday afternoon at
twelve o’clock, and they have to work
until nine and ten o’clock that night.
Who wouldn’t rather get up a little
earlier every day and have a whole
afternoon once a week?” was an ex
pression of sentiment that voiced the
thought and met with the approval
of the entire class as to the hours of
work.
On the way to a picnic at a near-by
park on the trolley-cars, one Saturday
afternoon, when the car was passing
through another mill district, one of
the girls said in rather a loud tone of
voice: ‘ 1 Yonder is Mary Evers, sit
ting on that door-step. Don’t you re
member she came to Night School be
fore Christmas and now she works in
that mill?” pointing to a giant struc
ture. that loomed before us on the ca
nal bank.
“O shut up, Lizzie, ”, said the irre
pressible Nancy, in a loud whisper,
“what do you want to give us away
for?”
“Give what away?” the teacher
queried.
“Oh, letting everybody know we
work in a mill,” several answered at
once.
“We are not ashamed, but we don’t
have to advertise ourselves,” explain
ed Susie Jones, apologetically, and all
the rest heartily agreed with her.
During the winter months, the en
rollment had been rather broken up
by constant entrances and exits; but,
with the spring, the pleasant weather
and the attractiveness of the school
had kept the attendance up to such a
high percentage that the teacher flat
tered herself that the girls came sole
ly for the love of learning, even
though it was only to get books from
the free library; but enlightenment
came unexpectedly, and the secret of
the success of the Night School was
disclosed.
It was in this wise. Late in April,
a new pupil came in, and on enroll
ment said, “Will you give me a pa
per saying that I come to Night-
School ? ’ ’
“Why? What for? None of the
other girls have asked for a certifi<gte
of attendance,” answered the teacher.
“I go to work in the mill,
and the boss won’t let me unless I
bring him a certificate saying that I
go to Night-School,” answered Mag
gie.
Sure enough, every one of them had
come in order to keep their places in
the mills; for, under the Child Labor
laws of Georgia, no child under eigh
teen can be employed in a mill, unless
he or she goes to school at least three
months in the year.
When the foreman asks them the
fourth question, “Have you complied
with Section Eleven of the law?” they
can answer in the affirmative because
of this school. The question arises
then if the trustees of the Free School
Fund had not seen fit to open this
class, how would the mills have been
able to get workers and keep within
the law?
Would it not be a wise provision
for them to establish these schools for
the benefit of their employes, as is be
ing done, by the largest mill in Au
gusta, and has been done for some
time by the Olympia Mills in the city
of Columbia, S. C. ?
Although the schools may be estab
lished for a selfish motive on the part
of the factories, in them the girls are
taught the principles of right living,
they are given an uplift, they are
shown that “Life is more than meat,
and the body than raiment.” They
are introduced to the best books of
the best authors, they hear good lec
tures, good concerts, and above all,
they are taught that it is neither pov
erty nor riches that makes happiness,
but the “Godliness with contentment
that is great gain.”
Ed. Note: Mrs. Dillon has well de
scribed one phase of our industrial
problem. There are thousands of just
such young creatures as she depicts,
whom dire necessity has forced to
labor for their own and others’ main
tenance. What is to become of them,
in turn, without education and indlis
trial training? After some years in
the shop or mill, experience shows
they become unfit even to keep up to
the old standard of wages. They drift
to piece work and make what little
they can, unless marriage offers a
way out. And mill or shop life as at
present wrecks the health and unfits
the girl for homekeeping or child
training, in the event she does marry.
NEW SALAD.
A delicious salad combines cream
cheese, green peppers, string beans,
and lettuce. To prepare the filling
take as small cooked string beans as
you can get, and have them as tender
as possible; mix them with some
cream cheese. Have green peppers
as nearly the same size as possible,
open them at the top, and remove the
inside. Cut them at the bottom so
they will stand up, and fill them with
the beans mixed with French dressing.
On the top of each pepper put a
spoonful of cream cheese and set the
pepers on lettuce leaves.—New York
Times.
