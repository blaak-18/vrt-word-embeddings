Miss Parrish Comes Back
That piece I wrote about the “Half
cropper” in the weekly Jeffersonian
of October fourteenth is true —every
word of it —Mrs. B. F. Kennedy’s
opinion to the contrary notwithstand
ing.
People who are so bright, so thrif
ty, so intelligent, so eager to learn
as those Mrs. Kennedy writes about
are not in the class that I have in
mind at all. There are a greaj many
people who live on rented farms that
are just as progressive and just as
good citizens as anybody, but the
other class exists and its name is Le
on, too. If Mrs. K. has taught
school extensively in South and Mid
dle Georgia and has not come in con
tact with this class, it is because they
do not go to school and because she
is not a close observer. I wrote that
piece in no spirit of unkindness to
ward these people, but in the hope
that in some way attention might be
'■awn to them and that they might
be helped.
Mrs. K. says, “As teachers in the
schools of the State we are employed
to serve this people.” That is true,
but how can we ever serve then un
less they come to school? She says,
also, “What would our schools do
without them?” Our schools do do
without them, except about two or
three days out of the week for about
months of the year.
Mrs. K. sayt» that not >-l of them (
are lazy and shiftless by a big majori
ty. All of those that I have in mind
are. They are lazy or shiftless, one
or the other —usually both. When a
man hustles and manages well and
tries to improve himself, his family

as good chance to make something
under the half-crop system as the
landowner has, for they are at no ex
pense for taxes, repairs, improve
ments, tools, machinery and stock.
I did not say that they are “infe
rior to the negroes.” I said that in
some respects they are less desirable
as tenants than negroes. The fact
that within them are possibilities so
far superior to the negro makes their
condition all the more pathetic. If
I had no faith in them I should not
care anything about their condition
or bother myself any way about it.
I am not afraid that any of those
so whom I refer will read what I said
about them with “flashing eyes and
scornful, curling lips.” I wish they
could and would, there would be
more hope for them then.
Certainly I have no inclination to
“belittle” these people. I should be
very glad to give them a lift if I
could —to inspire in them some ambi
tion —to implant in them better
Ideals of how to live, but I can’t do
much by myself. I should like very
much to see the State try a compul
sory educational measure on them. I
believe, myself, that the children of
these people, if they had equal op
portunity, would compare favorably
in intelligence with the children of
the more progressive class. I have
noticed that as beginners they are
about average, but their lack of ad-

vantages, 'their unhealthful habits
and surroundings, the hardness and
privations of their lives, so stunt
dull and dwarf them by the time
they are twelve or fourteen years
old, until they are perfectly inert,
listless indifferent, and it is then al
most impossible to awaken in them
any interest or ambition.
Nor have I any desire to bring re
proach upon our Southland. Nobody
loves this land of sunshine more
than I do, but it isn’t the part of
▼
wisdom or of patriotism to close your
eyes to unpleasant conditions around
you and pretend that they do not ex
ist. You had better face them square
ly and go to work the best you can to
better them.
Love Is So Strong
Constance Johnson in September
Everybody’s
Love is so strong;
It joins onr souls forever more, Sweetheart,
No matter though the winds of ill blow long,
No matter how the storms of life upstart,
Love is so strong.
Yet Love is weak:
It can not stand alone amid the strife.
It can not teach our faltering lips to speak;
It can not even save one little life!
S Love* is so weak! . *
But Love is strong;
Those whom our eyes have lost, Love still sees clear.
And thoughts too deep for speech ring through Love’s song,
And Love alone can face Death’s presence, dear,
And still be strong.
■
But let me thank you, Mrs. K., for
leaving breath in me —for not entire
ly annihilating me. That is a favor
for which 1 am very thankful, for
you gave me a close call.

WE ATTRACT OUR AFFINITIES.
There is something back of the
rose that enables it to clothe itself
with beauty, to call to itself a fra
grance which intoxicates. It at
tracts its affinities —beauty, grace,
sweetness from the same sur
roundings from which another plant,
close beside it, extracts deadly
poisons and odors which disgust.
Two members of the same family,
having the same parents, the same
environment, and the same advan
tages, grow up diametrically opposite
in every respect. One calls out of
his environment a liberal education,
fine culture, splendid opportunities,
while the other grows in ignorance
only, sees no opportunities, and, if he
did, would not grasp or utilize them.
Os the same stock, and in the same
environment, one develops virtue,
the other vice; one beauty and the
other ugliness.—Success Magazine.

how poor you may be. You can give
kind words, speak hopefully to those
who need to be cheered, and you can

WHAT SHE DID.
“Please state the Court exactly
what you did between eight and nine
o’clock on Wednesday morning,”
said a lawyer to a delicate-looking
little woman on the witness stand.
“Well,” she said, after a moment’s
reflection, “I washed my two chil-
dren and got them ready for school,
and sewed a button on Johnny’s coat,
and mended Nellie’s dress. Then I
tidied up my sitting room and made
two beds and watered my house
plants and glanced over the morning
paper. Then I dusted my parlor and
set things to rights in it and washed
some lamp chimneys and combed my
baby’s hair and sewed a button on
one of her little shoes and then I
swept out my front entry and put
away the children’s Sunday clothes
and wrote a note to Johnny’s teach
er asking her to excuse him for not
being at school on Friday. Then I
fed my canary bird and cleaned off
the breakfast table and gave the
grocery man an order and swept off
the back porch, and then I sat down
and rested a few minutes before the
clock struck nine. That’s all.”
“All!” said the dazed lawyer. “Ex
cuse me, Judge; I must get my
breath before I call the next wit
ness.”—The Dodson Times.
SKUN.
A priest went to a barbershop, con
ducted by one of his Irish parishon
ers, to get a shave. He observed the
barber was suffering from a recent
celebration, but decided to take a
chance. In a few moments the bar
ber’s razor had nicked the father’s
cheek. “There, Pat, you have cut
me,” said the priest as he raised his
hand and caressed the wound. “Yis,
y’r riv’rance,” answered the barber.
“That shows you,” continued the
priest, in a tone of censure, “what
the use of liquor will do.” “Yis, y’r
riv’rance,” replied the barber, hum
bly, “it makes the skin tender.”—The
Argonaut.
SUMMER’S GONE AND *
IS HERE.
The leaves have sought their long
repose,
The wind of Winter chilly blows,
And seems to sing a requiem
To flowers dying on their stem.
The barren trees appear to moan
Because their verdant garb is flown;
The meadow-land is brown and sere,
For Summer’s gone and Winter is
here.
The crow is calling to his mate,
The cows are lowing at the gate,
For shady lane nor grassy fields
No longer now to them appeals.
The robin hails the break of day,
And sweetly sings his roundelay;
The katydid and cricket’s near,
For Summer’s gone and Winter is
here.
—PIUS CLEMENTS.
*
Just Suited.
“I would like to help you, my
poor man, but I haven’t much work
to give you now.”
“That’ll suit me down to the
ground, ma’m, I don’t want much.”
—Sourire.
