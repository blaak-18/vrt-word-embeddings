AFFAIRS LOOK DARK
The Dowager Empress Is Said to Hold I
i Bold Back Signatures-Indem
I lty Question Causing the
Authorities Concern.
Washington, Jan. 9.--Comlpications
are again clouding the Chinese sit
uation. A dispatch ha., been received
from Minister Conger coutirnnug the
report of the failure of the Chinese en
voys to sign the prelimiinary agreement
reached by the powers. The indemnity
question is causing the authorities con
cern, and the agitation felt in Euro
pean chancellories over the Russo
China agreement, regarding Manchuria
has communicated itself to officials
here.
Minister Conger will try to induce the
Chinese envoys to accept promptly the
preliminary demands of the lsiwers and
begin the negotiations for a permanent
treaty. The state department has ad
PRIJCK CHINO.
dressed inquiries to the powers as to the
method to be pursued to reach a -peedy
and effective disposition of the claims
for indemnity.
Europe will be allowed to deal with
the Russo-Chinese agreement, the
United States not entering, for the pres
ent at least into the discussion, or im
pugning Russia's purpose to evacuate
Manchuria. At the same time the au
thorities think it advisable for the pro
tection of American interests to keep
advised of Russia's conduct, although it
is not watched with the keenness with
which every act of Germany and Great
Britain is scrutinized.
It is understood that the next cabinet
meeting will consider the Chinese ques
tion, especially with relation to the in
demnity and it is expected that this
government will finally recommeno that
the matter be left to The Hague 'ourt of
arbitration.
CHING MAY SIGN.
he. Prinee flms Bound to Ratify B.
esaue of Former Announeelnont.
Pekin, Jan. 9.-The protest of the
viceroy of Yang Tee against the signing
of the official joint note created a little
surprise here, but the fact that the oth
er southern viceroys protested, causing
the court to instruct the plenipotentia
ries not tb sign the note, created a great
sensation in Pokin. The agreement
has not yet been presented for signa
ture. The ministers believe, however,
that Prince Ching is too irrevocably
bound verbally and think he will sign.
Li Hung Chang is invisible to the
publio. His attendants claim he is suf
fering from a serious relapse, though
many persqps think his relapse was
made a convenience, so the signing of
the note would be delayed until the
court can be heard from again.
Von Roque, a nephew of Count von
Waldersee, rode 70 miles Monday
bringing news of a battle between the
Chinese and German troops to the north
east of Pekin. Three companies of in
fantry and one troop of Uplans met 2000
Chinese. An engagement ensued in
which 200 Chinese were killed and y00
wounded. Three German soldiers were
killed and one officer and several men
wounded. The remainder of the Chi
nese fled.
Favor Intera.utbn a Comm.siaon.
Washington, Jan. 9.-The United
States has proposed the question of in
demnity and of the framing of new
commercial treaties with China to be
considered by the international com
mission either at Washington or at the
capitol of one of the other powers con
cerned thus removing these two phases
of negotiations from Pekin.
Zepress Opposing Acceptance.
Washington, Jan. 9.-Minister Con
ger cables the state department that
there is ground for the belief that the
empress dowager is opposing the accept
ance by China of the demands of the
powers.
rFatally Cut inl the Neck.
Gainesville, Tex., Jan. 9.-A serious
difficulty took place between two young
men at a neighborhood singinging given at
the home of Parson Wilson on the
banks of Red river in the Territary, a
few miles northeast of Gaines.ville, in
which Eugene Foley was fatally cut ii
the neck and thrcat. The head wai, al
most severed from the lbxly, the deepest
gash being in the back of the neck.
