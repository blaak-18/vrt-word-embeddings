Miss Mamie Stockett Dead
After a lingering illness Miss Mamie
Stookett died at the residence of Mrs
(iragga, on Market street, at an early hour
Tuesday moraine, of ty r h ,ad fever.
Miss Stootstt came to Shreveport about
two years ago from Misisetopi and was
appointed the oaclat stenog:apher of the
distrnct court, a pesliton she filled most
ereditably. Indeed Miss Skockett was one
(f the beet, a thoroughly preoblet stasog
rapher. Her work was always oorreot and
clear and she received frequently, as she
deeerved, the tasnerons enoosiums, the
heartfelt expressions of appreciation of the
court and those conneoted with it is a
legal capaoity.
Miss Steokett was a womanly woans;
medest, reserved, dignllesq, sweet tem
pered, gentle and kind. It has base said
of her that she would rather suter an in
justice than to seek an explanation or to
wound the Ieeinags of any one. To beh
work she applied herself dihvently and
assiduously; her ambition was to ears
money, not to supply her nede or fancies,
but to help bet mother and sisters, one of
whem is an invalid, and as a worker her
enralags were greater than is within the
reach of men aaung first rate poeitions.
Her life was not spent in val. She was
lovable in character and in her usee m
lag. womanly was she won the admira
tion and the esteem of the judge, of the
oloials connected with the court and the
members of the bar, by whom her uner
pete*d demise is regretted.
The remains of this young lady were
takes to her home at Terry, Miss., for
interment.
Her reward is glorileaton In Heaven,
her homr forever.

WORK OF A WOMAN'S CLUB.
It SCatablished and Condveted the
PFagree Gardens of Deaner.
When the late Mayor I'ingree of De
troit instituter) his famous ne-nut lot
gardens for the poor. other cities of the
Union followed the example, and all
the world wondered why nobody had
thought of the thing before. In Den
ver the %%'enean s club first established
Pingree gardens in 1M94 and has con
ducted them with shining results ever
since. The club has 1.tt0 members,
being pe, baps the largest woman's club
in the world. In Ieever 1,(5) merm
berg of a woman's club means 1,st)
I votes in the next election, no when the
ladies of the organization called on
1 the city and county authorities for aid
In the Pingree garden scheme they
were treated with the utmost deference
and respect. Officeholders were swift
to do the ladies' bidding. This it is to
be a voter.
The county commissioners plowed
the ground and furnished a superin
tending gardener to instruct the char
ity vegetable raisers. The city board
gave free for Irrigation purposes all
the water needed in the gardens. Own
ers of vacant lots donated the use of
them for vegetable raising to the ex
tent of nearly 80 acres, the charity or
ganization furnished the seed with alac
rity, seeing the bright prospect of pau
pers helping themselves and relieving
more or less both the public and pri
vate burden of Denver. Even the street
railways donated the car fare of gar
deners unable to pay. The ladies, as
is the wont of women, had little money
of their own, but, womanlike again,
they were master hands at wooing it
from the pockets of men for charity.
The club, however, furnished the tools
for the workers.
On an April day in 1894, In accord
an"e with a public notice, the would be
vegetable and small fruit gardeners
met the ladles. They were as motley
1 a host as ever gathered from the four
corners of the earth into a prosperous
western city, mostly foreigners, but
among them some broken American
natives down on their luck.
There were men out of work, men
and women too old to work, men who
habitually never did any work, but
wanted novelty, and children of all
ages. They went to the gardens and
were put to the task of growing food
for themselves. A hundred families
asked the privilege-that, too, although
Denver has a smaller pauper popula
tion than almost any other city in the
Union. Thrifty Italian mothers took
with them their numerous progeny and
worked the garden while their hus
bands worked at day labor somewhere
else. Often this woman and child la
bor was supplemented by the moon
light toll of the husband himself after
his ten hours' task was ended. Every
day through the entire season some
members of that splendid club were
present to watch their proteges, to note
the absentees and give the word of
commendation or warning as either
was needed.
The results of this faithful fostering
for seven years show what women can
do when they turn (romn foolishness
and triviality and do philanthropic
work along scientific lInes. With this
woman's club work was not all talkee
talkee.
The hundred families applying for
the privilege of free gardening were re
duced to an average of AA. Many of
them through the encouragement given

to them were enabled to provide for
themselves altogether. The Idle form
ed habits of work, the sickly became
healthy. The total annual cost of the
garden. to the city is leas than $850.
The value of the vegetables raised is
$2,500. Some families sold $150 worth
of products besides all they used for 1
themselves.
A number settled permanently in the 1
eountry and are making excellent pro
fessional gardeners. Particularly are I
mentioned "tour sickly widows," who I
lived on charity. Once having clasped I
the helping band of that blessed wom
an's club, they rose to their feet. In the I

Summer
oGown
One of the most attractive costumes
shown me this season was a dress made
of enfe nu init veiling over crinison
silk. The underdress was not expected
to show only when the wearer wished
to lift the outer skirt to save it from
contact with the vulgar earth. Around
the Iottomu there was a flounce about
ten inches wide, and this was headed
by a row of luxeuil lace In string col
or. This over the cafe au lait made a
very effective contrast. The waist was
drawn to a point in front and rounded
in the back, and there were several
narrow folds at the bottom In place of
a selt of any description. The lace was
arranged to resemble a pointed yoke
both front and back, a pleasant change
from the eternal bolero and figaro.
This dress was one of the latest impor
tations from Paris, and therefore the
skirt was long in the back and shorter
In front than has been considered neces
sary for fine dresses. It was not a dress
to wear in the street, but for carriage
and porch and garden party require
ments. Veiling and the whole long list
of transparent woolen and silk and
wool as well as thin silks are more
fashionahbe than ever before. The
woman may call herself happy who has
one of each kind.
Parisian dressmakers say that skirts
are to he longer than ever and quite as
narrow around the hips, but wider if
possible around the bottom-that is to
say, the flounce at the bottom will be
made fuller and more fluffy. The light
tans and all the leather tints are In
high favor Just now, and indeed noth
ing is better, for any color of under
dress can be used, and when there are
two or three slips of different colors
the variety of effects can be greater.
Many of the soft veiling gowns have
the linings made so that they are in
terchangeable.
White for pretty summer toilets is
still the favorite and black stands next.
Black grenadines and lace dresses are
among the most elegant of all the sea
son's output. A black lace or fine veIl
ing or grenadine gown can be worn
anywhere for any occasion.
I notice quite a movement to bring
about a draped skirt, and several new
ones show the shirred place over the
hips, which throws the fullness out in
a very new way and a pleasing one.
Many ladies do not care to have the
skirt fit so closely over the hips, and
anything which tends to obviate this
difficulty will be welcome. The idea is
to have the upper part of the skirt
made considerably wider at the top,
and the superfluous fullness Is then
gathered to the figure in shire. This
la much prettier than the old style.
A novelty is rare in these days, for it
seems as if everything had been ex

plotted, but it appears that bias folds
of such stuff as etamine and grenadine
laid one above the other over half the
dress are new, at least this year. Skirts
are cut with a decided Sare, and all the
lower part covered with the folds laid
double. none over an Inch wide. It is not
easy to get these folds to stay just as
they are put, arv only an expert can do
It, but the effect when done is beau
tiful. It takes a great quantity of goods
to make these skirts, and for that rea
son they will never become common.
In a letter from a friend in Paris I
find that at the great races, where all
the new and elegant dresses are worn
and the fashions for the season are to
a certain extent set, lace gowns have
the first place. A few of them are
made over silk of a contrasting color,
but the finest have the same shade and
color of lining. Where there is any at
tempt to obtain a princess effect it is
done by means of narrow tucks run
Into the waist line.
The corselet skirts are not at all pop
ular there, but the blouse and fancy
shirt waist are. The blouse is carible
of so much ornamentation that it is no
wonder that It pleases the Parislennes.
One odd feature of the summer is the
silk paletot. This Is long, so as to cov
er the most of the drAs, and may be of
changeable silk In any light shade or
color, or it may be black. Some are
fairly covered with chiffon rumles, and
they are ornamental In every way.
Hats are mostly the wide brimmed va
rieties, with many roses or black
plumes, like the Gainsboroughs. This
is so becoming a style that it is no
wonder It continues in favor for so
Many years.

was a talented and successful writ.'r
at her home in a western city. She re
ceived an offer of $.0 a week to comn
to New York and do certain work In
her line. The thing looked so dead
easy that she might have suspected
something would happen to break her
luck, but she 4"d not; neither did those
who employe. her. Well, something
did occur almost immediately that sent
everything overboard for both herself
and her employers, and there she was.
stranded in New York. She bravely
undertook to stay and work into news
paper writing. She tried It. Sh b wrote
well, and some of her contributions
were accepted. But before they w.e
printed and paid for she was down to
her last 24 cents. She was a stranger;
knew nobody of whom she could bor
row. Her room rent was paid in ad
Vance. She had a roof over her for a
week. Meantime she could skimp on
food. How did she do it? "I lived
mostly on rolls and coffee," she said.
"I could make coffee in my own room.
I boiled the grounds over almost as
long as they would color the water.
Meantime I -bought a couple of eggs
and ate them to keep my strength up
till pay day came." Meantime also she
dressed neatly and was as bright and
charming as if she were a millionaire
girl. Nobody suspected for a moment
that she was living on less than 5 cents
a day. "And at the end of the five days
I was just as stout as ever," she said
mournfully.
"Jennie," said Papa Cornfed to his
granddaughter, "don't you go bouncing

A lady asked a friend-a married
woman in Ohio-to attend to some busi
ness for her there. The Ohio Ldy
wrote back: "Can't do it. The law
says married women, minors, idiots
and prisoners are not competent to
make bargains till their disabilities are
reipoved." When an Ohio woman's
husband dies, therefore, her "disabil

for a husband, however.

Coming down town in an elevated

a good looking young man: "Ab,

in tones of admiration they discussed
the fiue points of her game. Their re

Mrs. Fanny Hallock Carpenter,a law
yer of New York and president of the
Women Lawyers' club of that city, has
won a noble victory in her profession
before the court of appeals sitting at
Buffalo. In 1894 a man conveyed to
his wife certain property, amounting
to $75,000. Then he was sorry he did
it and tried to get it back. He brought
action to recover it and charged his
wife in court with dosing and drugging
him till he was out of his mind to in
duce him to give her the property.
The suit was decided against him. He
appealed It. Mrs. Carpenter was attor
ney for the wife and pleaded in court
her case so clearly and convincingly
that the wife won again. Now the hus
band will have to abide by the impulse
of generosity which he tried to crawl
out of. This case Involved perhaps as
large & sum of money as a woman law
yer has ever been called on to fight for.
