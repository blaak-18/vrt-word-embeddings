If the Ku Klux Klan is as danger
ous as some of these Cuckoos try to
make people believe it is, why don't
they point out some of the things
that make them dangerous? Why
don't they name at least one offense
they have committed in Pontotoo
County that would bring them into
disrepute ?
If the organization of 100 per cent
Protestant Americans is so dangerous
as the Cuckoos proclaim, why is it
that every law violator in the county
is against them?
If the Klan is a menace to public
welfare, why it is that the Cuckoos,
when guessing at who belong, invari
ably guess the names of the very best
men in the county? Do they think
they can make people believe that
these men have suddenly become law
violators and have lined up with a
bunch of criminals to destroy every
thing worth while?
If the Klan is a dirty bunch of
men, why is it that anti-forces make
the open accusation that ministers of
the gospel belong to it? Do they
mean to insult Protestant ministers
by asserting they would stamp their
seal of approval on anything that was
not right?
If the Klan is dead wrong, as they
charge, why do they talk it on the
streets that it is an auxiliary of the
Masonic fraternity? Do they mean
to say that Masonry is not founded
on sound doctrines, and that its mem
bership is not composed mostly of
good men?
If the Klan is a bad thing, is it
not a fact that 90 per cent of the
noisy anti-forces would be aligned
with it?
If the Klan doesn’t stand for the
protection of pure womanhood, why
is it that every moral pervert is
COLO.
WAS HARDING?
All America stood amazed when
the newspapers heralded the fact
that, standing beside the other mam
moth floral tributes on the lawn of
the old home, as the body of Warren
G. Harding passed, was a gigantic
cross of red roses with a beautiful
heart of white and on the arm the
letters K. K. K., a tribute from the
largest secret fraternity in America,
the Kr*hjfts of the Ku Klux Klan. I
say, all America stood amazed, for
the report had gone forth that mighty
political powers would seek to pre
vent the placing of that floral offering
among the others on that lawn. But
it was placed there and there it re
mained.
And now that Warren Harding has
crossed into the land where the eun
goeth not down, it might be well to
remind America that this great
President had a very tender place in
his heart for this great American or
ganization, and on at least two oc
casions gave those who sought its
downfall by unjust methods to under
stand that he would not join them in
so cowardly an undertaking. And so
it was fitting that, standing majes
tically back among it" fellows, this
blazing cross of red roses should bear
silent witness to his fidelity and tell
to the thousands who looked upon its
withering petals the story of the love
for and appreciation of such a man
by such an organization. And it was
fitting also that even the foes of that
organization and of those American
principles for which it triumphantly
stands today should step back, nor
dare to lay their hands upon that
cross.
Indeed, there must be a sickening
dread within the hearts of those in
fluences and forces that have con
tested every inch of ground over
which the Ku Klux Klan has come,
as they see the organization winning
first piece among all the secret or
ders of America and gathering like
an avalanche against every un-Amer
ican ideal that brings its blot and
stain to the pages of our swiftly
making history. And that dread
must become a panic indeed within
the heart of these forces as they real
ize that the loved ones and friends of
America’s departed President count

against them? Just keep your eye
on the two-legged varmints who have
no respect for the sanctity of the
home, and note the stand they are
taking against the Klan.
If the Klan did not stand firmly for
Protestant Americanism, would the
Catholics oppose them as they are
doing ?
If some men are such cracking
good judges, and are so strong for
law enforcement, why do they oppose
the Klan when they admit that its
membership consists of good men?
Why do they seek to destroy the
Klan?
If an organization is composed of
law violators and moral degenerates,
can it bs an effective factor in law
enforcement? Will it even attempt
to assist in any way to make this
country a better place in which to
live?
If an organization is composed of
good men, isn’t it a fact that the or
ganization will be just what its mem
bers are? Which would you be more
willing to risk yourself with —an or
ganization of law violators and their
henchmen, or an organization that
the opposing foes themselves admit
is composed of good men?
If these things are worth anything
at all, aren’t they worth studying
over? Isn’t it about time for peo
ple to wake from their peaceful slum

see what is going on?

their flaming cross and plant it by the

Gentlemen of the Ku Klux Klan, I
urge you to stand true to every ideal
and standard of life that is Ameri
can, that you may be worthy indeed
to take your place in the leadership
of life of this mighty Republic, to
which glorious heritage God has un
doubtedly called you. We have faced
a mighty foe, foe that fought our
country before it fought us. We have
faced an enemy that despises the
ideals and principles that are Amer
ican. We have fought through and
up until at last our banner is plant
ed on the hills and our blazing cross
flames afar. The nation looks to us
for a mightv revival of Americanism,
true and undefiled. It is our happy
heritage to defend the ideals for
which our fathers died on bloody bat
tlefields. I call upon you to stand
true, to make good, to be clean and
honorable, to live clean lives of rec
titude and humble service.
And if thus we live and thus we
forge forward, our blazing cross shall
light the way for mighty men of
leadership within this Republic and
we shall hold aloft their hands while
they, in the name of the Christ who
died upon that cross, lead this Re
public forward to victory. And when
their forms shall lie within the dust
from whence they came, our blood
red roses shall wither on the mound
that marks their sleeping place and
America shall lift its hat as it passes
by.
This writer has stood inside the

Th» CALL OF THE NORTH
THE BIBLE SHOULD BE BEAD IN ALL SCHOOLS
It is appalling to note that the
Word of God has been so neglected
in our institutions of learning the
past decade. Some school boards
have protested against the use of
reading of the Bible to the pupils in
morning exercises or otherwise.
They claim that it is sectarian, that
the children are of different denomi
nations and that some would have
their feelings hurt should the Bible
be read in the opening exercises.
But this is not the case.
When I attended school nearly all
of the pupils, whether Jew or Gentile,
Catholic or Protestant, Methodist,
Baptist, Episcopalion or what not,
looked forward to the teacher’s read
ing a P§alm or some portion from
the Bible each morning, followed by
the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer.
We, as school children, felt that the
day had not begun right if we did
not have such preliminaries before
we took up our lessons. I remember
one teacher taught us that it was
very irreverent to begin a day’s work
without first acknowledging God’s
work.
Yet in spite of the good influence
of the Bible, much has been written
and spoken against the reading of it
in the public schools. And why
should the people of our nation, the
foundation of which was laid by our
fathers in the fear of God ever
bring forth such an issue? Of course
the Bible should be read in the
school —public, private and parochial.
How can we expect our boys and
girls to be true citizens without the
knowledge of this indispensable
Book? Daniel Webster has said, "If
we abide by the principles taught in
the Bible, our country will go on to
prosper; but if we and our posterity
neglect its instructions and authority,
no man can tell how sudden a catas
trophe may overwhelm us and bury
all our glory in profound obscurity.”
It is the only book that touches all
the points of humanity, and which
answers every question in regard to
man. It is a history of his fall and
redemption.
The young pupils and older ones,
too, need the Bible for literary cul
ture. It is a literature of power. It
is a school book in itself and an edu
cator. The New York Evening Post
says, "It is impossible to over-esti
mate the importance of the Bible as
a promotive influence in English lit
erature. Coleridge remarked that,
“From this storehouse of literary ma
terials our leading writers have most
freely drawn.” In 37 of Shakes
peare’s plays there is an allusion to
the Bible. John Ruskin’s mother re
quested him to memorize certain
chapters of the Bible, and he counted
it the best part of his education.
In taking away the Bible from
our school children we are depriving
them of the best thing that is in the
possession of our country. Where
did our code of morals come from if
not from Holy Writ? We forget the
principles that our country was
founded upon. We forget the Pilgrim
DENIED NATION’S ANTHEM IS UNSINGABLE
-K-K
Song Masters in Musical Round Table Blame
Poor Leadership.
-k-k
Denial that the “Star Spangled
Banner” is unsing'vble, as frequently
is charged, together with a laying of
the blame for sluggish performances
of it upon poor leadership, was made
at a musical Round Table of music
ians in New York City recently. If
any audience does not sing the Amer
ican national anthem well, it is be
cause the leader has not made the
proper manner of approach to the
singing of it, in the opinion of the
musicians. Instances were cited of
occasions on which the leader had
given such an unsatisfactory an
nouncement of the anthem that the
response of the audience was neces
sarily lukewarm.
Mood of Reverence
“The leader’s approach to the ‘Star
Spangled Banner,’ ” said one speaker,
“should at once set a mood of rever
ence for the song as a symbol of our
love of country. Such an introduc
tion is necessary in order to sound
the emotional key-note of the sing
ing.”
“In every such approach to the
singing of a song,” said another, “the
leader show draw upon the elements
of salesmanship, of which the chief
means are experience, example, testi
mony and argument. Of these the
weakest approach is argument. In in
troducing the ‘Star Spangled Banner’
the leader should show forth his own
experience as to the emotional appeal
of the anthem, and he may also give
testimony as to that appeal. Best of
tall, he should demonstrate by his ex
ample what the ‘Star Spangled Ban
ner’ means to him. He should not
lecture the audience aa to why they
should respect the anthem, for the
public dislikes being told what it
ought to feel. Reverence for the an
them, as a symbol, should emanate
from him irrespective of whether or
not he believes it to be perfect as a
song. How should he achieve that
effect of emanation? First, let him
pause in the continuity of the pro
gram. Let him wait until every eye
and ear is at attention. Then in the

Fathers; we have lost sight of the
martyr, the saint who died for its
principles. It is unfair to our chil
dren to take away the Book of
Truth, for the Bible is the very foun
dation of our civilization. Compare
our country to countries that have
lost sight of the Bible, or to some
that have never had it in a great
measure and see wherein is the lack.
It is sad to see how little of the
Bible college students know today. I
have read of late an account of a pro
fessor who gave an examination to
one hundred students. There were
nine questions and out of ninety-six
papers only eight were correct.
These students did not know what
the Pentateuch is, the name of one of
the Judges, one of the Beatitudes, or
where the Book of Jude is. Our citi
zens should not consider themselves
educated unless they can answer
these simple questions, which should
be taught right along with other
school work. Tolstoy says that
"without the Bible the education of
the child in the present state of so
ciety is impossible.”
Many children do not go to Sun
day school or church. Many have un
godly parents, many have not read
any part of the Bible and perhaps
the beginning of their moral train
ing should be in the public school.
Think of a Christian land prohibit
ing the reading of thhe Bible to its
school children who are to become
the citizens of our great nation to
morrow! No doubt, Roman Cath
olics have been the cause of such an
issue. Some of them have declared
that the Lord's Prayer and singing
of hymns should be suppressed. No
wonder so many Catholic countries
fail to make progress. Read history
and notice the inertness of countries
ruled by Catholicism, which comes
from the neglect of reading the
Bible.
Parents, teachers, scholars and
citizens, we must not neglect to read
the Bible to our children. We should
not in our attempt to train their
bodies and minds, neglect to train
them spiritually. Theodore Parker
says, "The Bible blesses us when we
are born; gives names to half of
Christendom; rejoices with us; has
sympathy for our mourning; tempers
our grief to finer issues. It lifts man
above himself; ... he does not
fear to stand alone.” When in
trouble or distress or perplexity read
a portion of the Bible; and children
have perplexities, too, do not forget.
The Bible should be read in the
schools. Such portions as “Honor
thy father and mother,” “Remember
thy Creator in the days of thy
youth,” “Keep thy tongue from evil,”
the Beatitudes, the Ten Command
ments and Proverbs are the pillars
and ground of truth in the moral life
of the child. Be wise, parents, teach
ers, school boards; let us have the
Bible, which is the beginning and end
ing of right living both for you and
your children, and your children’s
children. Women, let us vote for it.
—The Good Citizen.
hu§h that ensues, he may announce
the song. Following another brief
pause he makes a gesture of rever
ence and begins directing the singing
of the anthem.”
Men carve the sins of others into
stone,
But Christ, the Just,
Stooped calmly down, and wrote them
in the dust.
There under foot be trod, yea, sport
for every wind;
Swept from the sight and blotted
the mind.
Then out of sight within the tomb
He bade them lie,
And sorrowed much, for none escaped
the all-seeing eye.
But though our sins in stone be
carved,
Or written in the dust
Tis all the same, for Jesus Christ,
the Just,
Upon the cross bought sure release,
And bids us sin no more, and go in
peace.
For underneath the Lamb’s shed
blood they lie,
Hidden at last from God’s all-seeing
eye.

A demand that amusement places
be closed Sundays was made by the
Rev. W. A. Tetley, pastor of West

“Junking the Sabbath,” last night.
“The tendency to junk the Chris
tian Sabbath on the part of many
today is anti-Christian and anti-
American,” Mr. Tetley said. “God
established and sanctified it in the
time of creation. He stamped it with

NO RACE SETTLEMENT POSSIBLE
That the race problem never can be
settled in America is an outstanding
fact. One of the important facts
concerning the solution of the race
problem in that there is no solution
possible.
The negro race problem will always
be with us, but conditions undoubted
ly can be much improved.
There seems to be no definite meth
od that will bring permanent im
provements at this time. The very
best way out of the present difficulty
seems to be the simultaneous use of
several methods.
No method for solving the vexa
tious race problem can be successful
until some facts of a general nature
are well understood and foe this rea
son we venture to state some of
them here, knowing that one reason
why we progress so slowly is that
too many of us fail to get a general
understanding of the situation, but
having learned a few facts, we are
prone to rush into proposing a cure
for the disorder.
In the first place, both sides must
learn to take people just as they are.
Sometimes this is a bitter pill, but a
bitter pill is not made sweeter by
chewing it. There is too much of a
tendency to think of people as we
prefer them to be, and be greately
biased by this desire.
Both whites and blacks must accept
the negroes just as they are, and not
try to make them over. We may
wish that the negroes were as in
telligent and industrious as the
whites. Some negroes may excel
some white men in this respect, but
as a race the whites far outclass the
former race, and to plan as if the
two races were equal is unfortunate
for all, but especially the negro.
In like manner all must take the
white man just as he is. There may
be room for improvement, but the
person goes blindly to a blind man’s
trouble if he plans on any other basis
except the present conditions among
the whites. It is not merely a ques
tion of what the white race should
be willing to do, but what they really
want and are trying to get. We will
be a long step nearer the better day,
when both whites and blacks quit
planning on any basis except actual
conditions at the present time.
Then the negro must be considered
both as a race and as individuals. No
matter what a white man’s ideals and
ambitions may be, he is a white man.
No matter what a negro’s ambition
may be, he is a negro, and should
spend no more time worrying because
he isn’t white, than the white man
spends worrying because he isn’t
black.
As a race, both whites and blacks
must be considered on the basis of
the characteristics of each race and
not on the basis of the attainments
or faults of particular individuals.
However, the individual must not
be lost sight of. While the color
line will be maintained, yet that does
not prevent due recognition or indi
vidual worth. If a negro ever gets
to thinking that he is a white man,
he may cause trouble for others, but
is sure to bring trouble to himself.
If a white man is worthless he should
be considered a worthless white man,
and if a negro is educated, skilled and
sensible, he should be so regarded.
That this is being done more and
more is one of the hopeful signs, of
the times. While maintaining the
color line, true worth and greater
usefulness is recognized on the other
side of the line. Whatever prejudices
“PITTSBURGH PLUS” IS NOW ELIMINATED
-K-K
Announcement Means Saving of (500,000
Yearly to Purchasers of Steel.
-K-K
Chicago, HI. Announcement was
made recently by the La Salle Steel
Co., which has a 30-acre plant at
Hammond, that it has permanently
abolished “Pittsburgh plus.”
The announcement means a saving
of approximately $500,000 a year to
purchasers of cold-drawn steel in the
Chicago district.
The La Salle company is the first
steel producing firm in the United
States to make formal announce
ment of the junking of “Pittsburgh
plus.”
Largest in the District
The company’s action precedes by
four days resumption of testimony
before the federal trade commission
examiner in the action brought by
the Western Association of Rolled
Steel consumers against the United
States Steel Corporation.
The L« Salle company is the larg
est one manufacturing cold-drawn
steel in this district. It has an an
nual output of 75,000 tons.
Elimination of “Pittsburgh plus”
means a saving of $6.80 & ton in
freight.
Steel sold recently for $3 a hun
dredweight and S6O a ton in Pitts
burgh.
Will Help Business Here
But Chicago buyers, purchasing
steel from any of the local mills, paid
$3.34 a hundred, or $66.80 a ton—
the difference being the freight rate
from Pittsburgh to Chicago.
But steel manufactured by the La
Salle company hereafter will sell at
the same rate as that manufactured
in Pittsburgh, without the freight
chargee from there.
It means Chicago manufacturers
we may or may not have, giving a
man credit for what he can do and
what he is, is necessary to the beat
interests of both white and black.
Finally the negro must be consid
ered, both as to his future develop
ment apd his present standing. We
must try to help the negro to become
a better worker and citizen. It is
true that training may spoil a negro.
It may spoil a white man. Perhaps
it is nearer the truth to say that
training may make a spoiled man
more conspicuous. Yet whether it be
a horse or a dog, or a white man or
a black man, intelligence makes its
possessor more useful to himself and
to others. Part of our task is to en
courage the development of those ne
groes who desire to become better
men and women and be better equip
ped to meet the tasks and problems
of life. This may seem like a long
tedious task, but all real improve
ment comes after a long tedious ef
fort.
While we must do what we can to
develop the negro into a more useful
citizen, yet we dare not overlook the
need of the hour. This is especially
true in the North, where we have
thousands of negroes hardly accus
tomed to the new conditions they
have found in the North, while the
Northern whites are not even awake
to a situation for which they have no
experience to meet. Here are vast
numbers of voters, the number about
doubled by woman suffrage, who have
never been trained to think for them
selves, who are unfamiliar with the
problems of government, and yet
each one has the same voting power
as the most intelligent person among
ug.
These people may become better
trained for citizenship but we must
not sit idly by until that time comes
or act as if it was here. The negro
question, always a serious problem
has become more serious since the
coming of the Elan. Until then they
were used only by unrelated, crooked
political machines. Today the ne
groes are becoming a prominent part
of a powerful combination.
Evil doers, criminals, and crooks
of all kinds naturally come together
since there is bitterness against the
Elan.
But on the other hand, not all ne
groes are lining up with the forces of
unrighteousness. If the good people
who believe in civic righteousness are
split up, then the demagogue and po
litical tricksters are sure to ride into
power.
Strange as it may seem, the most
important work in the solution of the
negro question, not among the ne
groes, but among the white people, is
to get as many good white people as
possible to open their eyes wide
enough that they do not line up with
the enemies of good government who
for a time are sure to control most
of the negro vote. Whether a person
likes the Elan or not, this much is
evident, that such a wonderful per
cent of the friends of good govern
ment have gone into it that the ene
mies of good government are left in
control of the opposing combination,
whatever that may be.
To any wide-awake, thinking par
son the Elan offers the only remedy
for the race question, not by mis
using the negro in any way, but by
so uniting the friends of public de
cency that those opposed to public de
cency cannot get into power, either
with or without the negro vote. —The

While no formal announcements of

cago district, such steps are expected
in the near future.
W. S. Leeds, president of the La

far as his company is concerned, said:

In its brief course lie all the Veritcs
And Realities of your Existence,
The bliss of Truth, the glory of Ac
tion,
The splendor of Beauty,
For Yesterday is but a dream
And Tomorrow is only a vision.
But Today,
Well lived, makes every Yesteday
A dream of happiness
And every Tomorrow a vision of
Hope.
Look well, therefore to the Day.
Such ia the Salutation of the Dawn.
