Inclined to look with scorn upon such gush

Entwlne itself in bow-knots without reason

And the way it crowed and cackled with its

Its provender was various, its appetite preea.

And a wonder was le plastli-'cordion-plaited

It was sometimes like a dummy, sometimes

Often like a wheel gyrating on a pivot or a

And its quick back-action plunging-swiftly

Yet this wrliglesome young sinner was the

It was cuddlesome end huggable, a package

And it really didn't matter-nor could tact its

A MARCH OF CUPID.
BY MRS. h. EI.. BAYN.
ADl a fiddle out of
his own head and
had wood enough
left for another."
If Hosea Downing
did not say those ex
act words, it was be
cause he preferred
his original form of
expresslon, but he
agreed with the sen
ti ment precisely,
and anyone ac
quainted with his son, Hosea Second,
will bear witness to the truth of the
statement and authenticate the value
of the wooden head. It was particular
ly noticeable from the fact that the vio
linist was the only freak in the family,
excepting the old man himself, the
girls being bright, pretty damsels, who
were quite the belles of the county.
iBut Father Downing had great faith in
the possibilities of the boy he had
hlandicapped with his own name and
idiosyncrasies. And now that he had
manufactured a musical instrument he
looked upon him as a newly-fledged
genius.
All the neighbors were invited to hear
Rosen, Jr., play such airs as his limited
knowledge of music permitted, and it is
a fact that several neighborhood ven
dettas were lured to a peaceable ending
by the youth's discordant playing,
wvhich passed among the tuneless and
tone-deaf as the sublime efforts of
genius, and those who were educated
out of that sphere were glad, for peace's
sake, to listen attentively and applaud
without stint. Like all domestic bigots,
HRosea pere had his weak side, but it
had not been properly appreciated un
til now. The awakening of his soul to
the influence of the "heavenly maid"
was but the prelude to another awak
ening of much more importance to the
pair interested.
It happened that theonlyother young
man who owned a violin in the district
and attempted to play it had been igno
miiniously dismissed from the Downing
fanmly for attentions to the pretty and
sensible eldest daughter, Maud, who re
turned his affection with her whole
heart and soul. There was no earthly
reason why the young man would not

have been what is called in society
parlance, "an eligible suitor," but Mr.
Downing thought he knew better than
the girl what sort of a husband she
wanted, and he interfered. Besides,
young Robertson's grandfather had
once gotten the better of him in a law
case, and, like the typical Scotchman,
Downing had been nursing his wrath
all these years to keep it wvarm. The
fiddle proved a greater pacifier than the
GospeL West Robertson was invited as
a virtuoso to give Hosea, Jr., some help
in his musical experiences, which usual
ly drove the rest of the family into the
woodshed, and although he had pever
left off courting the gIrl it gavehim the
opportunity he coveted of seeing her
openly and above board.
At this stage of the proceedings it co
cured to some of the Downing family
to give a qnuaical, with Hoaea as sole
performer,; maid quite a company as

very little whether he has a wooden
heart or not, for any endowment of
natural sense which he may have to
begin with will be fondled out of hinm
by the injudicious attentions of his
womankind. - The most brilliant youth

and Roses was no exception to the r6le.

It Was, howevei,: his favorite roadstes',
Say -Dek, who did the transportilg in
s ,natty C-spring buggy, built for two.
I The turnout was hitched at the gate,
awaiting Mir. l~obertson's pleasure. It
was noticing the ring that gave Father
D)owning an idea.
"Robertson," he said, in a friendly
way, "jump into your buggy and drive
down the road a piece, and see haoly
fur you kin hear the vi'lin."
"All right, sir," responded Robert
son, "if one of the girls will go with
rne. You know I'm tolerable hard of
hearing."
"No, I didn't know it," said the did
man, dryly; "take one of the giris and
go 'long--you won't hev fur tew go,
most likely."
"One of the girls" was a positive
stroke of genius. Those girls were

one had pressing duties elsewhere-all
excepting Maetd, who was at once hus
tied into the buggy by the others,
There is a free masonry, among young
people, as potent as that of the ancient
order, when they want to bring things
out on the square.
Father Downing had no time to inter
pose objections until the two were out
of hearing, bay Dick flying with them
down the road like a streak of shadow
in the silver moonlight. Vest Robert
son held the reins taut in his right
hand, while his left arm stole about
Maud's trim waist, and two young
heads inclined Innocently toward each
other, and if the fiddle squeaked they
did not hear it. What they did hear
was the music of the whole orchestra
of love.
Meanwhile Father Downing sat with
his watch in his hand and timed the two
who were supposed to be doing their
"whole duty as listeners. Hosea played
that violin an that instrument had never
been played before or since. If his play
ing was not "noble and sublime," like
that of the founder of his school, it had
both audacity and excitement. His
musical feats on one string electrified
ti

his audience. They were moved to tears
when he gave them "Sweet Home," and
"Suwanee River" brought forth rounds
of applause. Then Father Downing
again consulted his watch-which he
had forgotten in his enthusiasm--and
stopped the music to say hastily:
"Something has happened to them
two! I bet that horse has run away!"
The girls looked at one another.
They were frightened, and like their
father believed there had been a run
away. But they exonerated the horse.
In the moonlight and distance the
two lovers had crosed ten miles of ter
ritory, and neither had thought of the
violin. They had taken sweet draughts
of pleasure from each other's eyes, and
made up for lost time by exchanging
coufidences about their future. And
then Bay Dick turned into a lane that
led to a house that was lighted as if for
company.
It was the parsonage of the church in
that parish and the minister himself
stod in the doorway to welcome his
callers. I presume he had been informed
beforehand of the service he was ex
pected to perform, and his wife and
daughter were on hand as witnesses,
and when his two visitors left he was
richer by a liberal fee, and West Rob
ertson was possessed of a wife. And
Bay Dick went back to the Downing
homestead as it he had wings to his
feet.
The whole family and the visitors
crowded down to the gate, and Father
Downing, reassured by the safe return
of the truants, asked, sarcastically:
"Haow fur could ye hear Hosea play
in' ?"
"Clear to the minister's," said TVest
Robertson, as proud as you please, "and
I have the pleasure of introducing to
you my wife, and we both ask your for
giveness it we have done wrong."
- "Haow fur could ye hear the vi'lin,
did ye say ?" drawled the old man.
And then Hoses, Jr., came to the rescue
with what he called a "ehune" fo the oc
casion, which was a composite of
"Haste to the WVedding" and several
other melodies, and his father was
"called of," and if he did not forgive the
runaways he made no demonstration of
enmity. He had been fairly beaten in
love if not in war. He touched on the
subject only once more, and then it was
to ask Robertson what "chune" Hosea
was playing when h& heard him at the
minister's.
And Robertson answered, innocently:
"It sounded like a march."-Detroit

n Nearly a score of ears ago an in
hf genious woman who occupied rooms in
v a house in a southern city found her
Ia quarters rather too cramped for con
a venience. - and set about arranging
h some device to give herself more room.
SShe secured a dry-goods packing-box,
and opening a window in her room
t slid the box out upon the sill, and with

of the chandelier. In this convenient
and accessible *addition she prepared
all her meals for mot than =a year.
e The house was situated so that the
rear looked out upon an alley, and the
box canted no annoyance to anybody.
Finding it desirable to make a change

the disgust of the owner of the house,
who was extremely whimsical, and pro.

j ured.
, jured.
It is a very easy matter'to ftl up a
e box in this way, and the only wonder
is that it is not more frequently done.
1 Of course, it shuts off the light from
I one window, for the curtain must be
kept closed to oonceal the cooking ap
paratus.
- It is surprising what an amount of
t work may be done in a little place like
this if one is neat and careful The
inventor of this convenience arranged
at one time to have such a box made
and fitted with strong hinges, so that
when not in use it swung out so as to
leave the window free, but an entire
change in her circumstances prevented
putting the box up for that purpose.
In a little annex of this kind, it must
be remembered that articles that
would be affected by extreme heat or
Scold could not be kept, as the heat
of the sun and the frost of winter
r would spoil them. The lady
who first made this experi
ment had a small nursery refrigerator
or ice box in her room, in which all o:
the perishables were kept. This boe
r had a tank at one side for ice and a
1 faucet She took very good care to
r get as pure ice as possible, then, when
it was melted, she drew the water into
a pitcher, strained it through several
thicknesses of cloth and used it for
her toilet. It was a matter of some
surprise to her friends how she se
cured such delightful soft water, but
she kept the secret to herself and en
joyed the luxury.
Where a house has inside blinds,
swinging closets of this kind can be
managed with the greatest ease, and
if the house is small, are of untold ad-s

PERILS OF THE STREET.
A IDroadway Workmn With Too Many
Wia en on His String.
It was only a simple, harmless string,
chalked so that all men and women
could see it and avoid it, held but a
couple of inches above the bed of cin
ders by a couple of workmen engaged
in getting the sidewalk level. But it
caused as much commotion for a few
minutes as a five-barred gate in a hunt
ing field. Broadway is about as lively
in the vicinity of 26th and 27th streets
of a nice afternoon as any other por
tion of that great thoroughfare.
The two workmen who were manag
ing a chalk line over the cinder bed
preparatory to laying a new sidewalk
appeared to have chosen the liveliest
part of the day. As the work was that
of but a few seconds it w asn't worth
while closing the walk.
The first second, however, saw the
line swept away on the red shoes of a
Broadway soubrette, who looked dag
gers and bowie knives at the man on
the curb. Ife got it back in place on
the tip of his thumb nail, only to lose
it again the next train. Then every
woman who saw it stepped on it.
They made a point of it, apparently
apprehensive of some trick by which
the line would be lifted before they
got completely over it. The men in
variably stepped over it. The woman
who didn't deliberately put her foot on
it, gathered up her skirts and jumped,
letting out a half smothered yelp like
that of a dog anticipating a club.
Sometimes a whole cluster of women
would suddenly bunch on one side of
the cord or the other, and then, fol
lowing their leader, would go over the
obstruction, skirts up, with a hop,
skip and jump at least a foot high.
But some one of their number would
usually manage to sweep it away with
them.
One woman with a firm chin and
evident decision of character saw the
cause of the commotion, and calmly
stooped, grabbed it and jerked it out
of the man's hand and threw it aside.
Then she walked on as conscious of
having performed a solemn duty as
the man is who has just kicked a
banana skin off the walk.
When the man at the curb end of
the cord wound it up at the end of half
an hour he had had more women on
his string in ten minutes than the
watering place young man has in ten
years.-N. Y. Herald.

NEW RIBBONS.
The Latest In Trimmings for Fall ]ats and
Gowns.
New ribbons for trimming hats are
of the warp-printed silk with the do
signs small and close. As we have
already said, wide ribbons will be
used, measuring from five to seven
inches. Black satin ribbons have what
milliners call mousseline back, like
dull, fine-repped silk. The gayest
cashmere designs are on satin ribbons
for autumn hats, and are striped with
black velvet. Other cashmere ribbons
have plain edges of satin. The printed
antique velvets already described are
also seen in -ribbons. Still another new
thing in taffeti-ribbons are stripes and
checks on chameleon grounds.
Yellow is a favorite color in demi
season gowns, and will be much used
in ribbons and silks of cashmere pat
tern, some having the genuine Spanish
yellow, which forms an effective back
ground.
Velvets of extra width are imported
for cutting the full circular capes
without seams. It is said more velvet
will be used in millinery than for
many winters.
Strass and steel ornaments will con
tinue in use in buckles rather larger
than good taste suggests. Buttons
that look like brooches made of Paris
ian diamonds will be used for Louis
XVI. hats and coats.-Harper's Ba
zar.
Colored Sapery.
The popularity of color luncheons
and other feasts has brought out some
bizarre effects in colored napery. It is
impossible that these should attain any
great vogue, as a trial or two will edu
cate even uncertain taste to better
things. Any color scheme shows best
and most satisfactorily when spread on
a satin-white cloth. A new "feature"
breakfast or luncheon is set out with
new or old Delft and is called a Delft
affair. To get the bit of blue back
ground desired a square or round of
lace or open drawn work is laid over
blue silk, which in turn rests upon a
white cloth. Especially happy is the
combination of polished mahogany
with the old blue ware, and a table
spread in this fashion lighted by globe
lamps or candles in candlesticks of
Delft makes a very attractive picture.
