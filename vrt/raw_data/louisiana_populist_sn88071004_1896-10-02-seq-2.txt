UNITY. :
The Bryan and free silver forces
in Louisiana are united at last, and
the success of that ticket in this
State, at least, is assured.
In the fusion the Populists have
secured one half of the electors, or
4 votes for Watson, which is the
best showing made for him by any
other State in the South, and con
sidering the fact that in future the
People's party strength will be
measured by W\atson's vote, we
have done well.
We are as much opposed to Mr.
Sewall for Vice President as ever,
but it might be unwise to take
him down before election, as ma
ny votes would be lost from it,
since Bryan and Watson is the
straight Populist ticket, and many
partisan Democrats could not swal
low it all at once.
Those Populists who are kboking
r for revenge for injuries received
at the hands of machine Dnemo
• crats, can console themselves with
the wry faces that they (Demo
crats) will make in the effort to
swallow the four straight Popu
lists which is now upon their offi
cial ticket. Our party is gaining,
theirs is losing.
We should have had more con
cessions on congressmen, but they
have pledged us one commissioner
and one watcher at each poll in
the 4th and 5th Congressional Dis
trlcts, if not in the 6th, and this
s means the election of Benoit and
Bailey. While the Democratic
congressmen in the 3rd and 6th
are in doubt because they cannot
' get the Populist vote, which they
might have had for concessions in
_ the 4th and 5th.
There is a labor vote in New
Orleans which they will need, and
which they might have had upon
the same terms, but which will
now run eandidates of its own.
All in all the arrangement is a
very good one. The Populists
could have done much better if
they had been united in their de
mands, and some of them had not
been threatening to vote for Bry
an and Sewall if we did not tuse.
The fusion will be advantageous
to our party in the future, and the
man who imagines that we can be
swallowed in this arrangement,
simply doesn't know the Populists
as they are.
But the best of all is that the
Democratic bosses have at last
consented to that which all decent
people have long wanted-an hon
est election-and Populhsts should
get in their work for their con
gressmen, and not only land them,
but prove to the world the infamy
ofat the count out last Spring.
Hurrah, for the Pops !
They have never yet been beat
en in a trade.

Our national ticket is now safe
in this State, and Populists have
only to look after their congress
ional : fairs, and in as much as
they and the l)emocrats are all
voting the same Presidential ticket,
it will be an easy nmatter for the
Popimlists to make converts to their
congressional ticket.
We have but to point out the
sacrifices andt concessions we have
made from a party standlpoint for
the sake of principle, to prove to
all fair minded Democrats our de
votion to the cause we are all
agreed upon, and the justness of
our claim to at least two congress
men in the State.
Then let every Populist get a
move and see what he can do for
Bailey or Benoit and Populist prin
ciples.
Let every man take the stump
or the field, or else help send soncme
one into the field.
As admitted by all the best post
ed men and the great papers, that
this combination of the Populists
and Bryan Democrats is lasting,
anl-that the strongest workers and
principles will control, then Popu
lists can control the combination if
they will. The first effort in this
is on congressmen, and we should
pull off our coats and get a hustle
on. Bailey is sure to win if we
do half our duty.
Did Not Surrender.
To our friends who stood by us
in our position against fusion, we
wish to say that we are proud of
them and proud of the fight we
made.
We maintained our position as
long as there was good judgement
in doing so, or anything to be
gained for our party by continu
ing in that course.
In the first place, the Special
Committee of which we were
Chairman, appointed by the State
convention, was instructed to. make
such changes in the electoral ticket
as may be made necessary by any
action of our National Committee.
So that the committee was prac
tically in the hands of Chairman
Butler and his committee.
As chairman, we received while
at Baton Rouge, from chairman
Butler a letter dated Sept. 19'th,
advising fusion similarly to the
following, in which he refers to
the first.
After receiving this letter, un
der the instructions of the conven
tion which appointed us, we had
no other consistent or reasonable
course open to us save fusion.
But we are satisfied with the re
sult. Elsewhere in this paper in
different articles we have given
some reasons why the fusion was
Jest, and theme are many others
that will be advanced from time to
time, and we hope that the true
Populists who have believed as we
did heretofore will still be the loy
al and true Populists they have
been, . and support the Electoral
ticket inally completed at Baton
Rouge Sept. 25th, by the legally
constituted authorities of the Peo
ple's party.
All true Populists should rally
to our ticket.
Here is Butler's letter:
Headquarters People's Party Na
tional Executive Committee.
Washington, D1). C., Sept. 26, '96.
Hon. H. L, Brian, Natchitoches,
La.
My Dear Sir:-I wroteyou some
time since asking you the political
situation in Louisiana, and also
urging you to arrange a joint etec
toral ticket between the Democrats
and Popuilists in your State, but
so far I have not heard from you.
I suggest that the Populist State
Committee ask the Democratic
State Oommittee to make a joint
electoral ticket with them, com
posed of four Democrats for Bry
an and Watson, so that every sil
ver Democrat and every Populist
in the State can vote the samne
electoral ticket. If you can not
pgst an even division of the electo
toral ticket, then I think it would
be better for you to agree, as a
cuPmprosnue, for you to take three
lectrsind let the Democrats have
vye, zaither thanail tohave a joint
electoral ticket. Of course, get
an even division if you possibly
can.
(Of course, also, get an arrange
ment on Congresimen if you can:
that is, get the I)enomcrats to sup
port ouir c:el idates for ( 'ngrrcss

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
" Of People's Party Clubs.
Washington. I). D. C. September 2 '96.
Political Club organization has
proven one ot the most effective ad
jnncts to camlpaign work that has
ever been devised. The present
campaign has brought into exis
tence more clubs than any otner
known in the history of the coun
try, The People's 1'arty must not
lag behind the procession. There
should be a People's Party Club in
every township in Anierica and,
where the party is strong, in every
school district. There should be
one in each village. and in each
city clubs should be organized by
wards. These clubs can be not on
ly an important help in the Ipres
ent campaigni, but they can also be
a permanent good to the party.
Here is the plan: Let each
State Committee recommend,
through the pubhie press and
through the regular organization,
the starting of Populist
Clubs in every precinct in the
State. No organizers are necessa
ry for this, although State anti
county organizers may be appoint
ed. But in the main the meople
should organize for themselves.
These clubs are to be open, are to
hold weekly meetings during the
campaign and after that as often
as they see fit. They are to report
the names of their officers (Chair.
man; Secretary and Treasurer) at
once to the National Committee.
together with a nominal charter tfee
of, say, one dollar. The National
Committee will in turn forward a
charter and enroll the club as a
member ot the National Associa
tion of People's Party Clubs.
These clubs are to have public dis
cussions, are to distribute litera
ture which will be sent to them
from National and State Headquar,
ters, are to attend rallies in a body.
are to do quiet work, to make con
verts in the neighborhood in which
they are organized; and are in
every way practicable :to lend en
thusiasm, energy and affectiveness
to the campaign. No initiation fee
shall be charged, and no dues oth
er than those voluntarily contribut
ed- No dues shall be paid either
to State or National Committees
other than voluntary contributions,
except the charter fee, which is to
be turned at once over into the Na
tic nal campaign fund. Literature
will be sunt out from National
Headquarters to every club organi
zation, the club in turn beeoming
responsible for its proper distribu
tion.
All present organizations, such
as legions, allianees, Silver clubs,
populist clubs. Bryan clubs and
other organizations which endorse
the principles of the People's Par
ty, should immediately send names
efoffieers, together with charter
fee direct to these Headquarters
andi become at once enrolled in the
National Organization.
All Peoples Party papers should
advocate this plan of club organi.
ration. It has the sanction of the
National Executive Committee and
will be handled directly from N1a
tional Headquarters. All reports
and correspendence concerning
this matter should be directed to

him safely through a extremely
bad ease of dysentery and teething,
and from a more skeleton of skin
and bones, it has made him a great
big solid chunk of thirty or thirty
five pounds."

says : "Our little irl 9 mouths old,

ommenooed using Royal Germetuer.
In three weeks I could eat anything,
