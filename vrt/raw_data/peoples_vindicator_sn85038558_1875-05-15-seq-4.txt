WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
ChJlampion .American Comie Paper /!
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfiully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as th, ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
lhae yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly ! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsie merits, be
ing the fiArst successful weekly humorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary deprmtmets Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-clas
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satiriesl,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be spark'Vng, original and pointed.
Wild Oats" will be first-class mi every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or0 suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

Dr. I. Walker's Califrials
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tatus of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VInxoGA Brr
rnat" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purier and a
life-givin principle, a perfect Reno.
rator and nvrigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vi.
soan Barrn in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonle,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.
The properties of Da. WasL.
na's Vinsoa BrrrTus are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Lasa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter-Irritant,
Sudorifle, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious.

with their vast tributaries, through

Summer and Autumn, and remarka

heat and dryness, are invariably as
companied by extensive derange
ments of the sttmach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerfal influence upon these vari

There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Da. J. WALERn's VIsNoAR

the dark-olaored viseid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
