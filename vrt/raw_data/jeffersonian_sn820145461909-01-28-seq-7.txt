“Lack of organization is mainly the
cause of the deadly indifference, but
in this State our miserable election
laws was the prime reason of the
breakdown in our organization. We
ought to go into the work of organiz
ing clubs and have every member pay
10 cents per month dues and use the
funds thus raised to put the Jeffer
sonian and other good literature in as
many homes as possible. I don’t ex
pect to be personally benefited by
any effort or sacrifice I make in the
cause, as I am nearing the three score
and ten mile post; but he that lives
only for self is unworthy of the mis
erable little life he dishonors.”
WANTS TO ANSWER “UNCLE
REMUS.”
Clarksville, Tenn., Jan. 11, 1909.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Atlanta, Ga.
Kind Sir: Perhaps you read in the
December and January numbers of
Uncle Remus’s Magazine an article in
each entitled the Menace of the Mask.
The January number tells of the situ
ation in Montgomery county, the
county in which I live and have always
lived. The article to which I refer
does not only the people of Mont
gomery county a great injustice, but
it also does the Farmers’ Association
a great injustice.
I am just a common, orphan country
boy and have to work for wages upon
the farm and haven’t much education,
learning most of whot I know at night
and rainy days when my employers
had nothing for me to do»; but my ob
scure position in life does not present
any reason why I should not love my
people, whom I have seen impoverish
ed by the hard hand of the American
Tobacco Co. and its agents.
1 am preparing an article treating
upon the conditions in the tobacco
district and I would like to know if,
when I have completed it, you will
give it your consideration for publica
tion in your magazine. The article
will not be radical nor in it will I de
viate from the truth in any way. It
will not be a criticism of Don Mar
quis’ article, but instances will re
mind him of errors he has made. To
be frank with you, he has only given
one side of the question in this county.
Hoping that 1 may hear from you,
by return mail, in regard to this mat
ter, I am
Sincerely,
HUGH RAY NOLEN.
P. iS. —I can give the names of some
—of the best men of this county as
reference in regard to my character,
honesty and veracity.
(Ed. notes: Send the article, The
Jeffersonian will publish it.

“I stayed at the polls till every
vote was counted on the 3rd and you
received three to one at our voting
place. There was hardly any interest
manifested by the Democrats. We
ought to organize in every county in
the State and be ready to put out a
full state ticket two years hence. The
people know that you are right, and
thousands voted for Taft that would
have voted for you if we had geen or
ganized. I believe the time has come
when the people will act with us if we
can organize and show them that we
are in earnest.”

FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT.
The day has vanished, far into the
night;
When no man can see his way,
The political schemers have won in the
fight
So long that they hold full sway.
The moneyed kings have said to us all:
You can raise as much sand as you
please,
We rule, while the parties rise and
fall,
And master the situation with ease.
The way to judge the future, is always
by the past;
Which has been for the favored few,
Who heap on the heads of the poor
’til the last
The ills of poverty the world
through.
But wake up, brother! wake up! and
study the- parties through;
For now it is broad open day,
And be sure and vote the Populist
ticket that’s true,
And you will certainly start the
right way.

Dear “Tommie”: On the 31st of
October I sent the following to The
Atlanta Georgian and News, I
thought, in time to appear on or be
fore the morning of the day of the
election. After some hesitancy I de
cided to send to you.
From the numerous candidates
for the Presidency of Jhe United
States I chose the name of Thos. E.
Watson f following reasons:
Ist. We were born in the same sec
tion on Georgia soil, I being his senior
by a number of years.
'Georgia! Grand old commonwealth!
I love her, from her hoary head, lulled
by the rippling streams of the moun
tains, to her tireless feet, bathed in
the briny Atlantic.
Georgia! I love her from the rush
ing Chattahoochee on the west to the
sluggish Savannah on the east.
Watson! The peerless Georgian!
I would love to see him at the helm of
the government of these ' United
States, each represented by a shining
star, of which none shines brighter
than the one representing the State
that gave birth to T. E. Watson.
Georgia! There is magic in the
sound. Watson! Towering strength.
2d. During his boyhood I moved to
his native town and became assistant
in the school of the town, N. A. Lewis
being principal. In that school there
, was a bright-eyed, auburn-haired boy.
His name was T. E. Watson. He was
also a member of the Sunday School
in the church near by.
My wife taught a class in that
school. T. E, Watson was a member
I5l)& 3tffersonlan
of that class. Thus opportunities
were had in boyhood to learn some
thing of the boy that has made the
man.
3rd. I did not only know him in
boyhood, but all along since I have
known him in the home, as a friend,
as a lawyer, as a statesman. I have
always found him measuring up fully
to the demands of the occasion. I am
really of the opinion that, if elected
to be the Chief Executive of this great
Republic, he would as fully meet the
demands of the office as any other to
be found in her broad realm.

The Jeffersonians, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sirs: I have just received
your advertisements for The Jeffer
sonians. They will appear in The
Sentinel this week. I shall also pub
lish a clubbing rate with the two
Jeffersonians, and I hope to be able
to send you a good number of new
subscribers. If the people get ac
quainted with The Jeffersonians they
will not be without them. I esteem
both very much, and never hesitate
to say that I think Tom Watson the
greatest man in the South. I think
he is doing a great work.
I hope to be able to help some.
Yours for the Jeffersonian princi
ples, H. N. SMITH.
The sooner children are brought to
understand that, idleness is a crime,
and that no amount of fine culture
can make them pass for valuable in
the world’s eye if they are unable to
earn a livelihood, and so must become
“hangers on” for others to support,
the better for them. That daughter
who helps her mother cook and scrub,
is far more worthy than she who only
paints and plays, and obliges her over

The demand for lumber in the Unit
ed States leads all the other countries
in the world. We are now cutting
timber from our forests at the rate of
500 feet, board measure, each year
for every man, woman and child in
the United States. In Europe, 60
board feet is the proportion for each
inhabitant. It is figured at this rate
that in less than thirty years all our
remaining virgin timber will be cut.
Few statements could be made which
will better convince the average man
that conservation of our forests and a
renewal of their timber resources is
urgent. —-Farmers Advocate.

TOM WATSON MELON—72 POUNDS
The best all-round melon grown in
Georgia. It has every good quality of
the famous Georgia Rattlesnake and is
superior to that variety in that it is
almost free from rotten ends. It is a
much better shipping melon, and it is
a much better keeper. It is superior
to the KLECKLEY MELON in that it
grows much larger and has all the
sweetness of that variety.
I have been growing melons for the
market for the past twenty-five years
and have tried all of the varieties
known in Georgia, and have no hesi
tancy in saying that the TOM WAT
SON melon comes nearer meeting
every requirement than any variety I
ever saw. I consider the seed to be
