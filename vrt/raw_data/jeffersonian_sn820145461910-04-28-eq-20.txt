THINKS JEFFERSONIAN FAIR
REASONER.
Dear Sir: —I think you have the
Foreign Mission advocates so badly
rattled they hardly know which end
is up. I think, after sober second
thought, they will all be with you.
They simply can’t help but be, if they
will shed their prejudice.
Say, didn't Brother Davis come to
the front in proper style? I would
like to strike hands with him. There
are thousands of true Watson men
in Texas —I’ve been there with them.
I usually make my own verdict,
and I agree with you in everything
you say—not simply because it is you
who says it, but because it is right.
I think The Jeffersonian is the fair
est reasoner I’ve ever read after, and
is opening the eyes of and putting
more people to thinking than ever
before. Yours is the Golden Rule all
the time; that’s why I love you so.
I hope you may live to be as old as
Mathuselah, and then turn to a six
teen-year-old boy.
Yours very truly,
W. E. GARRARD.

“OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF
BABES”—
Dear Mr. Watson: —I have been
reading your debates on Foreign
Missions. Let’s send the negroes back
home; that’s where they belong, so
let’s put them back.
That Foreign Mission business is a
humbug, and I know it. Why don’t
they take care of their own people
who are helpless? I think it is a
shame for them to do our own people
in that kind of away. I want you to
put it to them harder than ever be
fore.
I think the negro a curse to thou
sands of our white girls and women.
Wishing you success in your busi
ness, I remain
Your friend,

COSTS MONEY FOR MISSION
ARIES TRAVELING.
Editor Jeffersonian: —I have read
with care all of your remarks on the
subject of Foreign Missions, and al
low me to add some facts which have
come under my personal observation.
About a year ago one of those for
eign missionaries from the wilds of
Africa came to my house, as I had
known him in his boyhood, and
while in this city he gave one of
his Mission Talks; he and his wife
sang songs in the African tongue,
and gave a brief history of their
work in converting those cannibals
in the depths of an African forest.
His description of the expenses
tallied with the reports I have read
in The Jeffersonian. The climate
was so wearing on those mission
aries that every two years or so they
had to return to America to recruit.
This enormous expense of travel
from Africa and return is a fair
sample of the cost of “Christianiz
ing” African heathen.
If that is Christianity, hell is full
of it. You may set it down as a
fact, that this method of Christian
izing the heathen in Africa is based
wholly upon the principle that it
gives the missionaries fat salaries,
and when they return home to rest
they are able to purchase a fine
home out of the funds donated to
Christianize the heathen of Africa
and elsewhere. This missionary
traveled over many States, singing

The Chinese Problem
The insight into the Chinese situa
tion afforded by Mr. Frederick Poole
in an interview in The Herald today
is interesting and suggestive. The
cry of “China for the Chinese” is one
that the Occident must heed. The
resentment of foreign interference is
a natural accompaniment of the half
awakening of the Chinese people.
Later, when their eyes are fully open
ed, they may welcome the stranger
and his resources. Now they see
only the selfish motive of the pro
moter, for which they can not rea
sonably be blamed overmuch. Mr.
Poole’s closing sentence is pertinent:
“Never in the history of foreign re
lationship with China was there so
great a need of delicate diplomatic
handling.” The representatives of
the United States in the Orient
should be something more than ad
vance agents of the money lenders of
Wall street, or the railroad promo
ters and manufacturers. The serv
ices of statesmen are required in the
Far East. —Boston Herald.
THE WEATHER.
Us farmers in the country, as the
seasons go and come,
Is purty much like other folks —we’re
apt to grumble some!
The spring’s too back’ard fer us, er
too for’ard—ary one —
We’ll jaw about it anyhow, and have
our way er none!
The thaw’s set in too suddent; er the
frost’s stayed in the soil
Too long to give the wheat a chance,
and crops is bound to spoil.
The weather’s eether most too mild,
er too outrageous rough,
And altogether too much rain, er not
half rain enough!
Now what I’d like and what you’d
like is plane enuff to see:
It’s jest to have old Proveddence
drop round on you or me
And ast us what our views is first,
regardin’ shine er rain,
And post ’im when to shet her off, er
let her on again!
And yet I’d ruther, after all —con-
sidern other chores
I’ got on hand, a-tendin’ both to my
affares and yours—
I’d ruther miss the blame I’d git,
a-ruling things up thare,
And spend my extry time in praise
and gratitude and prayer.
—James Whitcomb Riley.
THE FARMERS’ CREED.
The late Henry Ward Beecher once
prepared a “Farmers’ Creed.” Here
it is:
“We believe in small farms and
thorough cultivation.
“We believe that soil loves to eat,
as well as its owner, and ought there
fore to be liberally fed.
“We believe in large crops which
leave the land better than they found
it —making the farmer and the farm
both glad at once.
“We believe in going to the bot
tom of things, and, therefore, in deep
plowing and enough of it. All the
better with a subsoil plow.
‘Teffersonlan.
“We believe that every farm should
own a good farmer.
“We believe that the best fertilizer
for any soil is a spirit of industry, en
terprise and intelligence. Without
this, lime and gypsum, bones and
green manure, marl and guano will
be of little use.
“We believe in good fences, good
barns, good farmhouses, good stock,
good orchards, and children enough
to gather the fruit.
“We believe in a clean kitchen, a
neat wife in it, a clean conscience.
“We firmly disbelieve in farmers
who will not improve; in farms that
grow poorer every year; in starving
cattle; in farmers’ boys turning into
clerks and merchants; in farmers’
ashamed of their vocation, or who
drink whiskey until honest people
are ashamed of them.”
