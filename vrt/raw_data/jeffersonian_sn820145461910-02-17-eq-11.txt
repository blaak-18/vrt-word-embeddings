Resolutions by Wood County
Farmers’ Union
Ist. Being the first county to see
the light of the F. E. and C. U. of
America, after its birth, and believ
ing in its principles, constitution,
and charter, we endorse the efforts
of our delegates to sustain same, and
will ever feel grateful to W. D.
Lewis, and others, for the Waco call,
as ve believe it brought to light the
secret methods adopted to disrupt
our noble order, that has been worth
so much to the toiling people.
2d. We sincerely regret that it
became necessary for our State offi
cials to have to reaffirm their alle
giance to the F. E. and C. U. of
America., but after seeing their mis>-
take, and the determination of the
loyal membership of Texas, they
came up like heroes, even the Execu
tive Committeeman, who thought he
had detected the invalidity of our
charter, reaffirmed also.
3d. We would stand for our Na
tional organization at all hazards,
and against the new charter.
4th. We condemn the chairman
of our executive committee for vio
lating the instructions of the con
vention not to use the press or cir
culars to influence the referendum
vote soon to be taken.
sth. We call upon all loyal Union
men of Texas to do their full duty
in this matter, and never sheathe
their righteous swords until an over
whelming victory is won, for we
know full well that secession of the
Texas Union means not only death
to our great order in Texas, but will
seriously cripple our great national
organization.
6th. We heartily commend our
National officials, who are now in
Washington city, in their efforts to
have wholesome laws enacted for the
farmers of this nation, and especially
do we endorse their efforts to have
the pernicious principles of the cot
ton exchanges eliminated, and the
passage of the parcels-post law.

The Ship Subsidy
Dear Mr. Watson:—This week’s
Jeffersonian to hand. Note what
you say about Neill, of Texas, beg
ging funds of the farmers to go to
Washington to lobby for the ship
subsidy bill. Say, is it not a fact that
Chas. S. Barrett has contributed to
that fund in money, and more by in
fluence? Neill says he has, by pub-
lishing his name in the list of con
tributors.
Your article, “The First American
King,” on page 13 of last issue ought
to be published in pamphlet form and
scattered from one end of this coun
try to the other.
It seems to me that our farmers
are just about the limit. I have
been a farmer all my life. Was a
member of the old Alliance. Hatched
out of that incubater a Populist.
Have seen just about the toughest
panic ever, under low prices, and
now have an opportunity of observ
ing like conditions from exactly op
posite causes. And yet we fail to
open our eyes and see that w’hile
under natural conditions the results
would be different, yet we have like
conditions, or effects, because both
arise from the same cause—trusts.
The worst trust-ridden nation on
God’s earth today. Judge Lindsey
has traced the beast to the white
house of Colorado, and is still fol
lowing it; and I have no doubt if the
Judge should get on the trail of the
national “Beast” he could trail it to
the national White House and Capi
tol. Wish some fellow would try it.
What you are doing for the For
eign Mission Beast is a plenty. Mr.
Watson, keep it up.
Yours for the right,
E. F. TALLEY.

MARSHALL COUNTY FARMERS’
UNION.
Dear Sir:—Please find enclosed a
copy of some resolutions passed by
the Marshall County Farmers’ Union.
Way up here in Kentucky the
Farmers’ Union is prospering and
watching her Southern brothers to
see how they will fight for the Un
ion principles; in fact, live up to the
Golden Rule. We are fighting the
fight here and surely gaining
ground, and send a message of God
speed to our brothers over all the
States. We read “Hon. Tom Wat
son’s books and papers” and thank
our lucky star that we have a
champion of his mighty power and
intellect to fight our battles, lead
our weak, defeat our enemies, and
confound the treacherous in our
ranks. When our State Union meets
again, this coming summer, we will
make a great effort to have it in
some city and have “Our Tom” to
come up once more in “Old Ken
tucky” and through his matchless
eloquence let the tocsin of unionism
be sounded the length and breadth
of the land and let him be answered
once again by the “Old rebel yell”
of a day whose memory is fast fad
ing into dim echoes of the past. My
father at his death some eight years
ago was a follower of Watson. The
last time he ever spoke to me about
him he said, Watson is undoubtedly
the smartest man in America today,
but as a politician he will fail, for
he is fifty years ahead of the times.
As a statesman, he will never die;
for as time goes on he will be recog
nized, and long after he dies he will
be more honored than today while
living. We read all of his writings
and agree with him on all, mission
aries, unionism and the negro ques
tion fully. We see so plain that it
looks like the most stupid fool could
not doubt but white man must rule,
and rule the world, and especially
the United States.
Nothing is more disgusting to the
middle class white people than to
see and splutterings” of a
lot of “educated weaklings” of the
country going into blubbering fits
over the condition of the negroes,
and turn away from the pleadings
of the unfortunate whites; brothers
of their own blood. I have written
too long and will stop. Fight them,
Watson, fight them; and when the
time of necessity comes it/ will be
found that the “Rebel Yell” has
been handed down to coming genera
tions of “white people.”
With the help of such men as
Watson, Barrett in the national
lead, and R. L. Barnett, John Grady
and Rev. Robt Johnson in the State
TJeffersonlan,
lead, we want to place Old Kentucky
at the head of the Union lists and
make the Old Kentucky Home the
envy and pride of other States and
a criterion for others to go by.
Here’s to you, boys, one and all,
for a white man’s country and Union
rule.
J. C. NOBLE.
P. S. —Am a farmer and not in
the habit of writing. Please pub
lish in Jeffersonian and send me one
dozen copies, and will take them to
my Local and try and get you some
subscribers. Please correct all mis
takes, and oblige. My father was
through all the late war and lost
everything he had in it, and never
recovered his financial standing.
Expect Watson remembers Col. John
C. Noble, the old Democratic editor
of the Paducah Herald before and
after the war. He was one of the
fire-eaters. N.

Resolved by the Marshall County
Farmers’ Union in regular session,

dred and sixty-four milllion dollars
of greenbacks now in circulation, as
advocated by the banks of the East.
2d. That we favor the Govern
ment issuing enough money of its
own make for the legitimate busi
ness of our people, and place the
money where the people can get it at
the least cost.

to the ship subsidy bill now pend

ask our Senators and Congressmen

such measure.
4th. That in lieu of the central

savings bank.
sth. That we favor the parcels
post, as advocated for the rural peo

States relinquishing a constitutional
right, for the rights of the States
are invaded by the Dick law; con
tinue the old State militia.
7th. That we send a copy of these
resolutions to our Senators and
Representatives, that they be pub
lished in the Union News, of Kutta
wa; The Liberty, of Lancaster, and
request that all the press over the
State, regardless of politics, will
publish same.
An Appeal to the Farmers
Editor Jeffersonian: —I wish to
address a letter to the Farmers’ Un
ion through your paper.
Gentlemen, don’t let your Union
go to “the four winds,” like the
Grange, Alliance and Farmers’ Insti
tute have gone, but supply your
selves with “sticking plaster” and
stick “like a leech.” I have been be
tween the plow handles and at the
hoe handle during the crop season
fifty odd years of my life. lam too
old and feeble to become an active
member of our organization, being
in my seventy-fifth year. But I am
with you might and main, as the til
lers of the soil, the people who feed
the beasts of the field, the fowls of
the air, and all the world of man
kind, who furnish business for every
enterprise and industry in civiliza-

tion, who are the most independent
class of human beings on earth, being
the producers of the supplies neces
sary to business and to living. Pledge
yourselves to stick together as a
class, and stick. Prove to all others
that you are not the dependent class
of human beings, but the indepen
dent class. Agree to plant only ten
acres of the best land you cultivate
this year, well prepared, highly fer
tilized and well cultivated, to the
mule or horse in cotton, the balance
that you cultivate in supplies for
your family and stock, you can’t
raise cotton without supplies, it is
cheaper to produce them than to buy
them at time prices, and much more
independence in having it at home
than in having it to buy. Raise your
supplies, and you will not need so
much money, and you can sell your
cotton when you get ready and put
the money in your pocket, instead of
putting it on time-price accounts at
a rate of 5 0 per cent, per annum.
Being the producers, who is de
pendent? You upon the non-pro
ducer or they upon you for bread
and business? Having earned my
bread by the “sw-eat of my brow” for
so many years, I know from expe
rience just what it costs to have it
at home. lam in sympathy with the
tillers of the soil, and wish them as
well as I could any class of human
beings living today.
If all the farmers of the South
will adopt ray suggestion on the ten
acres to the mule in cotton, and bal
ance of the crop in supplies for fami
ly and stock, in five years the pros
perity of the South would be the
wonder of the world. “Shoulder to
shoulder.” Farmers’ Union, and suc
cess to you.
