havte made every necessary pre-I
laration for the occasion, while I
the ladies have not been behind( in

Tbhe public roads along Cane and

The Democratic party in Ken

The Beauty or Private Entcr
prise.
I have just had an illustration
that I think ought to convince the
most skeptical on the plroblem of
government ownership of public
necessities : I took a small pack
age to the postoffico and found it
would cost 6 cents to send it any
where in the U. S., and that 12
cents would carry itto Honolulu in
the Sandwich Islands. Then I
went to the American express of
ice and found they would require
15 cents to the nearest office and 35
cents to earry it to Porterville,
Cala., or $3 to carry it to Honolu
lu-a difference of $2.88 in $3.00
Im the latter case in favor of the
postoffice ! The average pay of
the postal employes is $70 per
month, of express employes $18. I
Postal employes work about eight I
hours per day. As to the hours
express employes work I will give
you my own experience. I was
expected to be at work at 6 o'clock
a m., and attend strictly to busi
ness until 7:15 p. m., and had to
sleep in the office to guard against
burglars. I received $50 per
month and was forced to pay back
$1 per month to insure the compa
an that I would not steal anything.
Great is the private monopoly the
voting people uphold.
