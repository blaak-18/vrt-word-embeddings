OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
We want all you boys and girls to
hustle for your Christmas presents.
They will be worth having.
MADE AT ANDERSONVILLE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l will come
again, to correct an error. I see my
name was spelled “Linnie Laura,”
instead of “Annie Laura.” My
seventy-six-year-old grandmother has
an old chair here, which she has had
ever since the war. The prisoners
at Andersonville made it. Grandma
calls it “The Old Prison Chair,” and
I made up a poem with that title. I
will send it to you, as I think you
will like it. I received the book Mr.
Watson sent me, and I thank him for
it. I will get as many subscribers as
I can. We all like Mr. Watson, and
like his paper very much, better than
any other we take. I think Mr. Wat
son is one of the best men in Geor
gia-—Annie L. Cheves, Pelham, Ga.
The Old Prison Chair.
My grandmother has an old prison
chair,
Which she bought from the Ander
sonville prisoners who stayed
there.
She loves her chair, and she has a
right.
It is not allowed to be kept out of
our room at night.
You may hear the birds’ merry
songs;
You may hear iron tongs;
You may see sweets, and hear the
toiling bees;
But nothing will more please
You, and put you at ease,
Than this aged prison chair,
That has had many a care,
And was made by the Andersonville
prisoners there,
And that’s why it’s called “The Old
Prison Chair.”
DOESN’T LIKE CITY LIFE.
Here I come again. This is my
third time, and I would like to hear
from you boys and girls. Hope you
are enjoying yourselves at school; I
am. I hope you are learning fast. I
am learning all I can, for education
is the thing that boys and girls need,
these days. lam in the fourth grade,
and think there is nothing like school.
We live in the country. I don’t
think that I would like city life much,
for I have a brother in Athens, Ga.,
and he says that country life is bet
ter. With best wishes to The Jeffer
sonian Post-Card Club.—Your friend,
H. L. Smith, Lexington, Ga., R. F. D.
No. 3.
THE WATSON KNIFE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
girl, ten years old. lam in the fourth
grade, go to school every day, and
like to go very much. My teacher’s
name is Mrs. Hansford. She is a
good teacher, I think. I have five
brothers and one sister. My papa is
a subscriber to both Jeffersonians.
He has one of the Watson knives,
and it is just funny to see him in a
crowd, showing it to everybody; he
thinks it is so nice. I hardly know
how to write, but I wanted to write
so bad. Hope it will miss the
waste basket. —Your new cousin,
Rosa Nell Maxey, Mayey’s, Ga.

ANOTHER DADDY JIM.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l live in a
beautiful grove on a high hill, one
mile east of the Chattahoochee River.
Papa got a little boy and me out of
the Methodist Orphanage at Macon,
six years ago. I believe I have got
the best mamma in Georgia. Papa
brings me a nice present every time
he goes to town. We have a Daddy
Jim Lanier in our neighborhood. He
is a big, red-faced man. His hair
and whiskers are white with frosty
old age. He took dinner with us
once, when we had potato pudding,
and he told us about a man in the
long ago, who had so much potato
pudding that he would call his pigs
by saying “Cold potato pudding for
breakfast! Cold potato pudding for
breakfast this morning!” The pigs
would tumble over each other in get
ting to the trough. You may be a
better newspaper man than our
Daddy Jim, but he can lay you out
at a singing convention. lam eleven
years old. —Jessie King. (This lit
tle girl did not give any address at
the top of her letter. Won’t she let
us know where she lives? Daddy
Jim is interested in his namesake.
Couldn’t outsing him, but we might
outtalk him.)
WANTS SHORT STORIES.
Is there any room in your happy
band for a little twelve-year-old Geor
gia girl? I live in the country, and
like it far better than the city. My
papa takes both your papers, a\d
likes them very much. Why not all
of us join in and help Mr. Watson in
his noble work? I would like to
see some short stories in your paper
from the Post-Card friends. I have
brown eyes, auburn hair, and a few
freckles. Success to Mr. Watson and
his papers.—Ruby Dorris, R. F. D. 3,
Douglasville, Ga.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
There are two letters this week,
which are not dated, and the ad
dresses of the writers are not given.
You must always be careful to give
your address, your age, and to sign
your name plainly. If you do not
follow these simple rules, your let
ters will find their way into the
waste-basket, or “Waist-basket,” as
one of our young correspondents calls
it.
NO ADDRESS AGAIN.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l like to read
the little folks’ letters so much. I
go to school every day, and am in
the third grade. We will soon have
a new brick schoolhouse built. It
is very pretty. My teacher’s name
is Mrs. Hansford, and I like her very
much. She is a good teacher, too.
—Your new cousin, Bertha Maxey.
FROM CURLEW, IOWA.
I will write you a few lines. My
uncle takes the Jeffersonian, and I
like to read it. I am eleven years
old, and have one brother and six
sisters. We live on a farm. We
have breakfast at six o’clock. My
birthday is December 25th. I go to
school every day.—Susie Stratton,
Curlew, lowa.
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER.
Here I am, a new member of your
Post-Card Club. lam a little Georgia
girl, thirteen years of age. My papa
takes The Jeffersonian and the
magazine, and we all enjoy reading
them both. I saw so many nice let
ters that the boys and girls have
written to The Jeffersonian, that I
thought I would try my hand. lam
going to try to win a prize this time.
Our school will start next January,
and won’t I be glad? I have two
pets, one kitten named “Tom,” and
a biddie.—Janie Robbins, R. F. D. 1,
Sylvania, Ga.
THE FIRBLESS COOKER.
By an Expert Cook.
If you were to ask the average
woman to describe her ideal cooking
apparatus she would, in nine cases
out of ten, answer: “Something that
would make no heat, muss nor odor,
that would require no watching of
the fire nor stirring of food to pre
vent scorching or boiling over and
which she could leave with the cer
tainty that a stray draft would not
cause a conflagration.” A few years
ago this would have been termed a
“foolish dream,” but today any one
who is familiar with the tireless
cooker knows where she can turn to
find its realization.
In the minds of many there is a
prejudice against the term “fireless
cooker,” and in reality it is not a
tireless cooker, but merely one so
constructed as to retain the heat and
continue the process of cooking after
the food has been brought to the boil
ing point or heat been applied in
some other way.
The principle of cooking by insula
tion is not a new one and was known
and used in Europe before it became
common in this country.
A farmer’s wife, writing in The
Journal of Agriculture, says of the
tireless cooker: “It is the greatest
help to women of the age and the
greatest saver of fuel, time and la
bor. My dinner is all in the cooker
now, and it has been for three hours.
My kitchen is nice and cool and I
have taken a good rest. No running
to see about fires, just leave it alone
and when wanted all will be ‘piping
hot.’ ”
It cooks such foods as meats,
soups, cereals and many vegetables
more perfectly than could possibly be
done on an ordinary stove, and, with
the Rapid, one can also have delight
ful roasts, bread and puddings.
