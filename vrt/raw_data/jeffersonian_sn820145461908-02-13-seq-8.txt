Only a Couple of Letters,
(Letter No. 1.)
Thomson, Ga., Jan. 26, 1908.
Hon. Hoke Smith, Governor.
My Dear Mr. Smith: Your favor re
ceived.
As I have said to you before, there is
no office or appointment which I would
accept.
My work on the two Jeffersonians is
congenial and exacting, and I never ’ex
pect to hold another public position.
I am shocked, unspeakably, to see what
a misconstruction you have put upon the
finding of the Lunacy Commission in the
Glover case. That Report sustains what
I told you, viz.: that while Glover is
sane in the sense that he knows right
from wrong, yet he is unbalanced, de
fective, degenerate, “crack-brained.” You
have misunderstood the meaning of the
physicians. Their Report is ambiguous,
in the use of the words “defective” and
“degenerate,” but unless those words ap
ply to Glover mentally, they convey no
meaning. If you will inquire, specific
ally, of each one of those physicians, you
will find that my contention is correct.
The Georgia rule on insanity is.harsh,
but under any proper of a
case there is room to show that a crimi
nal is semi-insane, and therefore not as
fully responsible, before God and man, as
the more fortunate fellow-being whose
mind is perfectly balanced. There is ab
solutely no dispute about the fact that
Glover is unbalanced, and always has
been. That much is notorious.
Then, why should consideration of this
vital fact be ignored in grading the pun
ishment?
Admit for argument’s sake that it was
right to convict him of murder, does it
follow that he. a defective and degener
ate man, should be dealt with as though
he were sound in every way?
In the Kerlin case, a married man mur
dered his paramour, sunk her body in
the Chattahoochee river, and weighted it
down with old plow-shares that he had
brought along for the purpose. Yet he
was given a life sentence, and is now serv
ing in our penitentiary. In the Harvil
case, a defeated lover waylaid his suc
cessful rival, beat him to death from be-

hind, and dragged the body into conceal
ment. Yet he was given a life sentence.
The trend of the whole world is against
capital punishment; and in no case, now,
do the more enlightened favor the ex
treme penalty for crimes committed in
the heat of passion—with the one great
and necessary exception of Rape.
The record shows that Glover has not
had a fair trial. It was an infamous thing
for Boykin Wright to drag my name in
to the case for the purpose of inflaming
political prejudice against the defend
ant. It was wrong in the Judge to say
that the venue ought to be changed, and
then to allow Wright and Eve to bull
doze him, overnight. It was most un
just to deny the fullest inquiry into the
hereditary taint which Glover took along
with his life. The liberality of the pre
siding Judge who is trying the Thaw
case explains what I mean.
From the Pardon Board, I expected
nothing. General Evans is the father
in-law of Judge Eve, of the Augusta ring.
Tom Eason is Vnerely one of the Old
Gang.
Joe Sid Turner is the man of the Rape
Circular of 1894.
What had a Populist like Glover, or a
Populist like me, to expect from such a
tribunal ?
Nothing.
And we got nothing.
From you, we did expect justice, and
we have not got it.
Pardon me for speaking plainly —it is
a matter of life and death, and my feel
ings are deeply stirred.
If this crack-brained degenerate is
hanged, it will be murder. Society has
the right to put him where he can never
again do harm; but society has no more
right to kill him than it has..to kill any
other demented creature.
The Augusta Ring wants this man’s
life, not so much because he killed a bad
woman, as because he was the most dar-’
ing “Tom Watson man” that bucked
against the political rascality of which I
was the victim.
Boykin Wright wanted me assassinat
ed, and Arthur Glover was one of those
who saved my life.
I had hoped that this consideration
would have had some weight with you.
but it seems that I was wrong.
Time and again, in the city of Augus
ta, these Ringsters have given life sen
tences and acquittals to red-handed mur
derers whose crimes were as bad as that
of Glover. In one case they saved the
neck of a negro brute who had run amuck
in the streets, killing three before he was
stopped.
But the Ring wanted to save the ne
gro, and did so.
The Ring wants to hang Glover, and
it seems that the Ring will have its way
in this, also.
I can say no more. This is the only
personal appeal that T have made, nr
4
will make to you, and I know that it is
meritorious.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.
(Letter No. 2.)
Honea Path, S. C., Route 5,
February 1, 1908.
Mr. Watson:
I read an account .of your seeing Gov
ernor Smith of Georgia in behalf of one
Glover, of Augusta, Ga.
It seems as if Glover led a small band
to defend you in 1892. Mr. Watson, I
just want to say to you that I was there
that night, in the auditorium of the Ex
position building. Mr. Black made a
speech. I sat on one of the front seats,
and when the attack was made on you
I was one of the first men on the ros
trum (I had great respect for Mr. Black
for his plea for the people to hear you),
and with others, held back the crowd. I
will never forget that night. A police
man tried to throw me off the stand, but
I put him off. (I was just 22 years old.)
I honored you for your stand; you did
not show the white feather, but were as
brave and as fearless as ever man was.
I have admired you ever since that event
ful night, I always believed that you
were right, and still believe so.
At that time I was living on Judge
Claiborne Snead’s place, m Columbia
county, Ga. I presume you know Judge
Snead; he was one of your friends.
Mr. Watson, I have not written you
through any selfish motive, but just to
inform you that I was one of the “boys,”
and can prove what I have written by
men in Georgia; for instance, J. Henry
Gray, R. P. Tompkins, G. W. Morris,
and others. Long may you live.
’ Yours truly,
JAS. H. WOOD.

Against the Aldrich "Bill.
Never has there been any dispute of
the fact that the power to supply a na
tion with its currency is a sovereign
power. No government ever allowed
that power to slip from its hands, if it
was possible to prevent it.
One of the very first indications of dis
integration and governmental chaos is
the loss by the central authority of the
exclusive right to coin money. Thus, in
the Middle Ages, and in the Dark Ages,
it was an unfailing sign that the barons
had encroached on the king when the
feudal lord could exercise, without inter
ference, the right of private coinage. In
those times, you will remember, the feud
al lord claimed and exercised the right to
administer justice within his own do
main. In his own courts he tried his
vassals for their lives, and not only sen
tenced them to terms of imprisonment,
but sentenced them to death. The ex
ercise of this function, and the exercise
of the right of private coinage was, as it
were, a barometer by which you could
