SI A SUITOR UNMASKED.
BY BOREMOUAN.
RI PATRTC
MORI A RITY,
proprietor of
the Moria rity
g detective bu
rse reau, was seat
ed in his pri
vate office with
his legs crossed,
js r minatin g
upon matrimo
nial viaLssi
tudes-of which
he personally had experienced a full
share-when there was a rap upon the
door.
"Come in," said Patrick.
r The next moment a lovely vision
,k stood before him. As Patrick slowly
, unwound his legs and recovered from
his surprise, the vision resolved itself
- into a stately young woman, with
flashing blue eyes, a shapely figure
with an environment of laces; in a
word, a stylish girl, magnificently
* gowned, who carried herself with acer
tain imperious air that quite over
whelmed the proprietor of the detec
L tive agency. Patrick arose with a
start.
" 'Will you be seated, madam?" he said.
D "Miss Robson, if you please."
She took the chair he offered her.
"You probably know of me?"
"Hobson & Moore?" interrogated Pat
rick.
"J. L. Hobson is my father."
Patrick became more obsequious than
ever. Hobson was one of the merchant
C princes of the west, and this young
woman sole heir to ten million dollars,
more or less.
" Vhat can I do for you?" stammered
Patrick.
"You doubtless are surprised to see
me?"
S "Somewhat, Miss Hobson."
"WVell, I do not call about any do
mestic troubles."
"A h!"
"There is no skeleton in the closet"
"No, certainly not, Miss Hobson."
s "Do you know Jack Rowlston?"
"Yes."
Patrick knew him well and he
waited anxiously for his visitor to
state the object of her query.
"Well, he wants to marry me."
"Indeed?" said Patrick, for want of J
something better to remark. T
"Yes; he asked me four years ago,
and I refused him."
"Oh!"
"lie repeated his request two years
ago and I said no."
"Oh!"
p "Last week he asked me again, and I
reversed my decision." C
"I understand." e
"The trouble with Jack is that he is F
to blow; no life; no dash. He is too
demure and quiet." t
Patrick opened his eyes. This of spir- 1
ited Jack Rowlston? t
"In fact, he is so conservative and dif- a
ferent from other young men that I be- 3
gin to suspect that he is a hypocrite- a
yes, sir, a hypocrite. lie only talks to h
me about business and music and will
hardly smoke a cigar with papa, and
papa says: r'here's a steady, reliable q
young man. There's a young man
without a flaw.' Now, I like goodh
young men, but I can't help thinking
that Jack exaggerates his virtues, for CI
surely no young man was ever born al
who was quite so good as he would
make me believe he is. In fact he is
such an impersonation of perfection
that I fear I am not enough of an angel h
ever to wed 'him."
"Really?" said the amused Patrick. c
"I wouldn't for the world like to e
think him fast, for I like Jack; but if
he only was a little more different-
just a trifle less stupid-more enter
taining and-and, you know."
"I think I understand," observed is
Patrick, with a grin. tr
"But I am convinced that he is a de- o
as
-,
more open-. The fact is, this is a
woman's age, and no girl wants to be
treated like a doll. Now, if Jack only
made more of a chum of me, if -.
Here her eyes flashed and her voice ye
faltered. "But my business is this: I th
want you to write me up a journal of
all he does for a week." a
"But my dear Miss Hobson-" i
"Here is your first fee." And she
laid a crisp one hundred dollar note ona
the desk. "I was intending to buy a
spring bonnet with that, but I shall
devote my pin money to unmasking
Jack. Send me your report in a week.
Remember, all about him, nothing ex- ar
senuating. If I can only show him in
an
In a week I shall expect the report."
With that the vision vanished. Then
Patrick leaned back in his chair and
roared with laughter. He forgot all
his matrimonial troubles. "Haw! haw! ing
ha! hal" chuckled Patrick. tor
Ten days later Miss Hobson was seat-yoi
ed in her boudoir perusing in an sh
amused way a long report. There was w
a smile upon her lovely features. She
looked particularly beautiful that night am
In a dainty evening dress, and undoubt- ing
idly she looked all the more beautiful

"Oh, the wretch!" she exclaimed.

then the young gentleman himsel
came in. His hair was parted in the
middle and he had a somewhat staid,
reserved manner.
"How pretty you are looking this
$ evening, Margaret." he said, in a con
LY, ventional tone.
of "What a matter-of-fact way you
ty have of paying compliments!" she re
su- torted. "By the way, Jac.k, I haven't

Ich "What did you think of the races on

"Yes; I hear you were there."
"Why, how-"
on "1 really hope you did not bet."

el USEFUL AND SUGGESTIVE.
id, -Potato Sccmes.-Boil and peel six
sound potatoes, mash them until they
hi are perfectly free from lumps; add a
nM little salt, then knead it out-adding a
little flour-until it is an inch thick. A
o griddle is the best to bake on and the
re- scones should be pricked lightly with
a fork. This prevents them from blis
tering. Butter them while quite hot
and they are delicious -Prairie Farmer.
he -Spanish Buns.-Mix together one
pint of flour, one pint of sugar, one
cupful of sweet milk, one cupful of
butter, four eggs beaten separately,
one teacupful of liquid yeast, one tea
on spoonful each of powdered cinnamon,
cloves, allspice and grated nutmeg.
Knead thorotughly, then roll out and
cut into large biscuit, and set them to
rise in a warm place. When well risen,
bake them like rolls. As soon as they
are taken from the oven sprinkle white
to sugar over thear--Christian Inquirer.
--Columbus Eggs.-Boil hard any
number of eggs you desire. Take out
the yellows carefully, and while hot,
ld and mash fine and mix with them, to
se your taste, fresh butter, salt, pepper,
to mustard and a suspicion of finely chop
tf ped onion. Fill the empty whites with
this mixture, take care not to break
in them. Press the two halves together
a so that they will look like a whole egg. .
Cut a small piece from one end so that
n each will stand alone, as Columbus'
famous egg did, and serve them stand
ing in a dish surrounded with parsley.
-Woman's WVork.
-German Cabbage.-Shred red cab
bage to fill a quart measure, closely
packed. Put in water. Heat in a
saucepan two level tablespoonfuls of i
butter, with a little salt and pepper.
Put the cabbage in with only as much
water as will drip from the bowl, and
simmer for twenty minutes. stirring oc
casionally. WVhen done, add one table
spoonful of vinegar and let heat. Heap
on a platter, and squeeze mashed pota
toes through a rose tube, around the
I edge of the platter. The roses of pota- C
toes around the cabbage give a beauti. t
ful, decorative effect. This is an ex e
cellent way to cook white cabbage also. 

-Aunt Mary's Pudding.--Pour over
a pint of grated bread a pint and a half
of warm milk. Stir it well together c
and then add half a pint of cream, the V
r grated peel of one lemon, three ounces
> of sugar, a piece of butter the size oi
a an egg, and the yolks of five or siz

SFARMER AND PLANTER
n
Of THE PINEAPPLE.
a- An Indnstrv That is Proving Profitable
le to Florida Planters.
to The pineapple is one of the best
known and most relished of the trop
ce ical fruits. There are a great many
:r varieties of "pines," as the natives are
.1- wont to call them. but the Sugarloaf
at and the Strawberry or Red Spanish are
the most common on the markets. It
in will be slow and hard to educate the
in people on, the merits of the different
in varieties of~iines, as it has proved to be
in in the case of the orange. The Porto
Rico is to pines asthe great Navel is to
11 oranges - it is large and showy,
id but really not more luscious.
se Some of the various queens
re are quite melting and delicious.
Though, as in the case of or
e anges, much depends on cong'itiens -of
is soil, season, culture and fertilizatiopn
n The same pines grown in Florida are
r, superior to the Cuba or Jamaica fruit,
d and so of the main land and the Florida
Keys, the former being superior. Pine
d culture has just begun in Florida on
h the eastern coast, or Indian river re
h gion; yet several hundred thousand
u crates have gone to market in the last
.r year, and some small fortunes have
been made.
1 The profits may be said to run from
4 $200 to $2,000 per acre, according to
variety, culture, season and other con
. tingencies. The larger mentioned
e profits come largely from the sale of
slips and suckers of the new or finer
a varieties; some of these bringing fif
y teen to twenty-five cents each, while
the fruit sells for as much. One grow
v er in Orange county claimed to have
realized $5,000 from one acre in one
season. I aam not so optimistic as to
expect so much from this industry, but
I do expect to see the thousands of
i acres of palmetto and oak scrub lands
about me here on the little sub-penin
sula, Pinellas, growing thousands of
carloads of this finest of all Florida
fruits in the next decade. On a comn
mercial scale, it has not yet been
started on the western coast, but
I am confident that another sum
mer will see the first plantation
started. The whitest, poorest sand
hume seems the natural home of this
fruit. They require fertilizing a lit
tle, but will pay for all that is given
them. They delight in a partial shade,
hence many fancy varieties are grown
under latticed sheds. I should prefer
to treat them in this way, as extra care
makes extra fruit.
Good pineapple land is plenty, and
much cheaper than has been for-sev
eral years in these parts. Once plant
ed, they will fruit from the same roots
for three to five years. The first cost
of plants runs from two and a half
cents to twenty-five cents each, accord
ing to variety.
The cultivation is hardly to be con
sidered, as a scuffle hoeing or a little
weed-pulling is about all that is re
quired. The pineapple crop does not
interfere at all with the orange crop,
as it comes along after the orange crop
is laid by.
The pine, of course, is sensitive to
frost, but like the banana, it will soon
recover from the little scorching of
the leaves it occasionally gets in this
latitude.
Should the markets ever be glutted
with the fresh fruit, canneries can
work up and consume great quantities
of it, but it is hardly probable that so
limited an area could produce a super
abundance of so fine a product. There
is a great fortune for the pineapple t
farmer. - 1Vm. P. Neddl, in Di xie =

NITRATE OF SODA.
t
Its Value as a Fertilizer for Vegetables t
and Fruits.
Nitrate of soda is not designed as a
fertilizer for the large field crops alone. t
It acts beneficially on the small gar- f
den, and for nearly all of the ?small c
vegetables and small fruits. There t
are many garden soils where potash 1i
and phosphoric acid need to be acted s
upon by nitrate of soda to combine t
them in the growing crops. It is diffi
cult to tell how much such elements n
are in any soil, and how much nitrate
of soda is required; but with a little to
experiment one can readily determine d
"·rdinarily from t10 to 200 pounds t1

although previously they a : .
had a hard struggle. The same is true
of vegetables that appear to starve on
very rich soil. The trouble with the of
soils of such gardens is that they have St
all the necessary manurial elements
present, but they are not in a condi
tion for the plants to make use of at
once.
In applying nitrate 'of soda to the
garden it is always better to weigh o
out theamount desired, and then mix
it with fine soil or sand ajut five
times its quantity. Mix this thorough- m
ly, so that in spreadiug it in the gar- m
den an even distribution will be ob- m
tained. The nitrate of soda deposited
upon the leaves of tender plants ti
might injure them, or it it came by
in direct contact in large quan- di
tities with the stalks or roots. Conse
quently in applying it to any growing th
plants it is better to scatter the mix- of
ture between the rows, so that no part of
of it gets on the leaves. The next rain i
that comes will wash the nitrate into he
the soil, and the chemical process will th
begin immediately. It is a good idea
to hoe or rake the garden right after m
applying the mixture, as the nitrate laI
begins action more quickly then, as it he
gets incorporated in the soil immedi- th
stely. lo4
There are many advantages obtained inj
from the use of nitrate of soda on soils
that are rich with vegetable material, as
but it should never be used on a per- he
fect manure. It is the only supple- dr
ment to the others. It performs its he
best functions when applied as a top pr

growing. It stimulates them into new
growth, and it will often hasten their
maturity by one or two weeks. It is
the common experiencc that crops, both
Me of garden and field, that have been
forced by nitrate of soda have a strong
er tendency to resist parasitic diseases,
op_ and in wet, damp seasons these crops
are the last ones to yield to the attacks
re of fungi. Nitrate of soda will never
af exhaust the land, but will simply make
ye available the material in it. Continue
It to feed the land with proper barnyard
he ~anures and the nitrate of soda will
nt prepare their plant food for immediate
use. Try it on your strawberries, veg
to etables and other garden crops.-S. WV.

WHEAT AND COTTON.
How the Wheat Ralsers Manage to Keep
Ahead of the Cotton Producers.
The cotton interests have had much
to complain of during the past few
years in the way of shrinkage in Ihe
price of the fleecy staple; but the de
cline in price for the southern product
by no means compares with the great
shrinkage which has taken place in
wheat. Wheat has declined fully 50
per cent. in value, while cotton has not
lost more than a third of its value in
the same time, if that much. And yet
there is no discouragement in the west,
nor is there any report that the wheat
growers have been driven to bank
ruptcy.
The secret of the success with which
the wheat growers of the west are able
to resist the ill effects of such a heavy
shrinkage in value as their serial has
experienced is to be found in the sys
tem of diversified, or rather intensified,
farming which prevails there. The
western farmer does not depend en
tirely on a single crop, but diversifies
his products and makes himself self
sustaining as much as possible. WVhgat
thus becomes merely his cash crop.
and a shrinkage in its value only
means the curtailment, more or less,
of his luxuries and comforts, without
threatening bankruptcy and ruin, as a
drop in cotton prices so often does for
the southern farmer.
This system of crop diversification
and intensified farming is what is

-One pound of matter added to the

without question the influx of settlers
here will be largely augmented within
