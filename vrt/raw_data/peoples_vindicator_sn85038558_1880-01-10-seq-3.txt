As tlhe Jan u1Tay tunitnber, just issued,
CoIUUlIICes liliu saelnthi volIum of this
dcservedly popular periodical. It is a
brilliant Holidaty Nmnber, and the con
I tents huriiah a rich literary banquet.
Noteworthy amtnong the solid articles are,
"The Persecution of the Huguenots," by
Alfred H. Onernisey; "Antioth in Syria,'
by Godfrey A. Hudson; "Caves and
Cave-dwellers," by Arthur Grahame, etc.
Those who enjoylighter reading will be
delighted with "Chrysalis and Butterly,"
"The Governor's Dinaler" by Edward
Everrett Hale, "Be.be, the Nailmaker's
Daughter," by the author of "Gideon's
Rock," "Miss Olive's Boys," by Mrs.
Robert O'Reilly, etc., etc "Cihristmas
Day," and "From Thauksgiving to
l Christmas," and Mrs. Phrynne'w "Santa

people have inot been overlooked, and
will find pleasant reading in "Fre die
uTsnutou's Trust," "Elide and Seek.
"Lost," etc., etc. There are poems by
Bishop Ken, Gertrude Greenwood, and
other writers of celebrity. Rev. Dr.
Deems, wl.o has retired from the edito
rial chi"ai, will continuet a contributor
and has an admiral article, entitled
"Pessimism and sociability." Two new
features, we see, have been introduced,
"'Ohituary Notices" and "Recreations for
Sunday Afternoon," giving increased in.

pages abound with artieles of great merit,
and the illustrations which number about
1(10 are admirably execated. The price

policy should be common sense, inspired
yv genuine Aamerican principles and
backed l y honesty of purpose, For this
reason it is, and will ontinue to be, ab
nolutely independent of party, class,
clique, or organiratin or interest. It is
for all, but of none. It will continue to
praise what is good and reprobate what
is evil, taking care that its language is
to the point and plain, beyond the possi
bility of being msuunderstood. It as un
induueiedl by motive. which do itot ap.
pear on the surface; it has no opinions
to sell, save those which may be had by
any purchaser with two seant. It hates
injustice and rascality even more tha4 jt
hates unnecessary words. It abhors
ftands, pities fools, and deplores nin
comapoops of every species. It will con
tinue throughout the year 1880 to chan
time the irst class, instruct the second,
and discountenance the third. All hon
eat men, with honest convictions, wheth
er sound or mistaken, are its friends.
And The Sun makes no bones of tellilng
the truth to its friends and about its
friends whenever occasion arises for
plain speaking.
These are the principles iupona which
The San will be conducied during the
year to come.
The year 1880 will be one in which no
patriotic American can aflors to close
bi eyes to public ffairs. It; a impossi
ble to exaggerate the iumportance of the
political events which it has in store, or
the necessity of resolute vigilance ont
the part of every eitie :a who desires to
preserve theGovernme.it that the founld
em gave us. The debates and acr of
Congress, the utterances of the press,
the exciting contests of the I:elbol..c:lu
and Democratic parties, now :,rlI~
equal in strength throughou,,t tlhe coaii
try, the varying drift, of public setti
meat, will all bear directi;v nail sliic
tively upon the 24th Presilential elec.
tion, to be held in November. Four
years ago next November, the will of the
nation, as expressed at the polil, was
thwarted by an abominable conspiracy,
the promoters and beneficiaries of which
still hold the loaes they stole. Will the
crime of 1876 be repeated in IssO? The
past decade ot years opened with a cor
rapt, extravagant and insolent Adiniaii
tration intrenched at Washington. The
Sun did somethng toward disloging the
gang and breaking its power. The sanme
men are now intriguing to restore their
leader and themselves to places from
whieh they were driven by the indigna
tion of the people. Will they succeed ?
STe coming year will bring the answers
to thee momentous questions. The
San will be on hand to chronicle the
facts as they ar developed, and to ex
hibit them leary and felessly in their
relations to expedieny and right.
