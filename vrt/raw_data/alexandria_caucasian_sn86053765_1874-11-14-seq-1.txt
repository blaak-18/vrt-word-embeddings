Interview Eotwccn an Arkansas
Carpet - Bagger and Attorney
General Williams .
I St. Louis Republican's Chattanooga Let.J
As a rule, the catpet-baggor of
tin; »South lias numbered among his
distinctive traits the rankest cow
ardice and personal poltroonery.
He has been adroit at manipulating
the votes and molding the opinions
of the colored brother. He has af
fected religion and philanthropy.
He has managed to present himself
to the gaze of the people of the
North in the attitude of a martyr.
Hut lie has always been a non
combatant. A whiff of smoke
sends him bustling intotho nearest
customhouse. A half-dozen boys
out on a fox hunt terrify him into
calling for "more jtroops.' 7 And
so on. This is the sort of carpet
bagger we lind in Patterson or Mo
ses, and Kellogg and Spencer. But
the Arkansas carpet-bagger is a
different breed altogether. He af
fects neither religion nor philan
thropy. A hardened sinner, he
glories in his depravity, and scoffs
at hypocrisy. But he has nerve
ana is game. There is McCIure;
Poker Jack they call him ; a per
tect type of the Ar kansas carpet
bagger. The best illustration I
can give of Mc( 'lure's character is
by describing an interview between
iiini and Attorney General Wil
liams last winter, after tjie Admin
istration had acted in favor of
Baxter.
McCIure came to Washington
with Ins blue eyes full of blood.
The opinion of the Attorney G «'lie
rai had struck him in the region of
I ho diaphragm, and to say he was
m ad would he to draw it very mild,
lie wen:, up to the Depaitment of
Justice and demanded to see Wil
liams. That functionary received
him.
" ! ;:;n Chief Justice McCIure, of
Arkansas," 5 lie began, "and I have
read your opinion oil the case re
cently decided by the President..
Now, sir, I wish to say that the pa
nels on which you baseil your opin
ion, and which you refet to as hav
ing been certified to you by the
clerk of my court, are either forged
garbled."
"What do you say, sir?" asked
the astounded Attorney General.
He had been accustomed to the be
havior of tlio lackey on the part of
the traditional carpet bagger, but
here was one piaying the bully, it
was incomprehensible to the Attor
ney General.
" i say, sir," replied the imper
turbable McCIure, " that 1 believe
those papers are either forged or
that new matter has been intepo
lated in them ; and I say further,
sir, that the reputation of your de
partment, and the known character
of yourself incline me to the belief
that these frauds have been enact
ed in your otïice, and by your insti
gation or connivance."
" What do you mean, sir V gasp
ed the breathless Williams.
"1 mean just what 1 say," replied
McCIure, still as cool as a refrigera
tor, "and I want to sse the origi
nals of those papers which you
claim have been certified to you by
the clerk of my court."
"I have sent tlieni to the Senate,
sir," said Williams.
"You talk, sir, like a man who is
lying," said Met Mure. "In fact, sir,
I believe you are lying. Not to
put too line a point upon it you are
a <1—n liar, sir. Original papers
are never sent to'the Senate or the
House except by special demand
for them. The resolution of the
Senate in regard to these papers
«W ISiL-fiXOmiMUffn^hj
called for copies, and copies were
sent. You do not wish me to see
the originals, sir, for fear that I will
detect the interpolations that have
been perpetrated in your oflice. I
believe you have been bought up
iu this sir."
At this Williams turned and left
the room, His eliiet clerk then
came up to McCIure and said : "J.
regard your remarks as a personal
insult to myself."
"(Jo to h —1!" said McCIure.—
"Y'ou don't know the difference be
tween an insult and an apology.—
There is uot man in this depart
ment who is capable of resenting
anything. Don't talk to me at all
sir."
Then Poker Jack stroked his
long beard, walked up and down
the room a few minutes and took
his leave. Well, that is the sort of
carpet-baggers the people ot Arkan
sas have to deal with. Men who
know neither scrapple, compunction
nor fear. They mean to revolu
tionize the State over again. They
are proceeding about it in a very
systematic way. And they will
make a deal of trouble before they
are disposed.
I
Comforting Sentence .
"One 'o them fellers," remarked
Bijali, as he handed out Tom Lud
ington, a young man charged with
vagrancy.
"So you haven't anything to do
eh r asked the Court.
"Nothing," mournfully answered
the prisoner.
"Out of work—no home, and
your cash so short that you could
not get into a woman's rights con
vention, eh V continued his honor.
"You've struck it, pardner' 5 an
swered the prisoner with a smile.
"Yes, and now I'll strike you, Mr
Lndington. I'm down on loafers
and vags, and I'm going to boost
you for a sixty if it tears the desk
down. You'll have something to
do up there besides sitting on a box
in an alley and whistling 'Come
Love, Come. 5 And when day fades
into night, and the remainder of
the world retires to rest, you'll
have a bed and some covering.
They'll hire some one to hoe that
dirt oft of you, cut your hair, dig
out your nails, and when you come
out you will be so disguised that
your own mother will think you are
some English duke, over here to
hunt ducks and buy gas stock."
The prisoner said he was willing
to go up, and if the institution
pleased him as well as he thought
it would he might come back for a
longer sentence.— [Detroit, Free
I'ress.
Wag walked into a saloon the
other day where three men were sit
sing around the tireless stove. As
lie entered all eyes were turned to
wards him. Apparently taking a
mental inventory of the number of
people in the room the new corner
stepped up to the bar and blandly
ordered four glasses of beer. The
boots that had adorned the top of
the stove now sought the iloor—
three men cleared their mouths of
tobacco, and looked at the bar-ten
der as he filled the glasses and put
them in a row on the bar. When
everything was ready the three
loungers rose and the stranger paid
for the beer. Then starting with
the glasses furthest from the door,
he emptied%ill that the bar-tender
had filled and quickly left the sa
loon. The three chairs were re
sumed.—I Wasau (Wis.) Central.
What man must have his glass
before he can do a day's work ? A

LOUIS NAPOLEON'S COURTSHIP.
[Springfield Republican.]
At a ball given by President Na
poleon at the Elysee, somo nights
before the coup d'etat, Mile. Engcn
io met her intnro emperor and hus
band. The manner of meeting was
somewhat romantic. Louis Napo
leon did not care much for the rush
of ball-rooms and he had chosen a
propitous moment to escape with
his friend Edward Ney, the l}uke of
La Moskowa, into the Elysee gar
dens, when he suddenly came upon
a radiant, blushing girl, who was
tying up her hair alone opposite a
glass in the conservatory. Her
hair had come down during a waltz
and the crown was too great to ad
mit of her reaching the ladies' dres
sing room; so she had glided here,
hoping to bo unobserved. Louis
Napoleon, seeing her in this strait
gallantly gave her his atm, and led
her round, by the private apart
ments, to the dressingrootn in ques
tion, and this time there was a mil
tual regard between the President
and the fair stranger. During the
following twelve months Madame
de Montijo and hei daughter were
invited guests at the Presidential
residences— Fontainebleau, Com
piegne, St CJond—and it escaped
nobody that the prince paid Mile.
Eugenie an inordinate amount of
attention. No one supposed, how
ever, that these attentions could
end iu a marriage, for the Presi
dent, having performed his coup
<Vetnt was on the point of becoming
emperor, and it was no seeret that
his embassador at Munich was try
ing to arrange a match for him with
a princess of Bavaria. The itiug
of Bavaria refused to give away his
relative to a prince whom he styled
an "adventurer," and then it was
that Louis Napoleon, much morti
fied at heart, resolved not to expose
himself to further rebuffs in court
ing royal princesses. Possibly Ma
dame de Montijo had been waiting
her opportunity, »for, two days af
ter the news of the Bavarian snub
had begun to get bruited, she
begged a private audience of the
prince, and told,him that, as his
attentions to her daughter were be
ginning to excite comment, she had
the intention ot leaving France.—
This was at St. Cloud, where tl»e
mother and daughter were both
staying. The prince asked Madame
do Montijo to tarry one day more,
for he might have something to say
to her, and hecmployed these twen
ty-four hours i:i acquainting his
ministers of his intention to marry
Mile Eugenie. The news fell upon
them like a shell. Nothing ot this
kind had been apprehended by any
one, and both Count de Morney, M
de Persigny and Edward Ney,
earnestly implored the prince not
to côh tract such a mesalliance.—
The communication was »made to
the cabinet on the 25th of Novem
ber. On the second *of December
the pritu'o was proclaimed emperor,
on the second of January the com
ing marriage was officially notified
to the French people, and on the
.'50th of January it was solemnized
at Notre Dame.

worth of peaches and gave the boy
one of them."
Among some notes on duels the

ing : "Richard Somers, a lieuten

so much blood from wounds receiv
ed during the first two that ho was
obliged to remain seated on tho
ground throughout the third en
gagement. He is said to have per
ished in the Intrepid lire sketch,

A gentleman who purchased a
box of peaches recently looked
around for a boy who would carry
them home, and presently he l'ou:;d
a ragged lad seated on a bench,
eating tho last remnants of a pear.
The man asked hi in if he wouldn't
like to earn ten cents by carrying
the box to such a number and
street, and the boy promptly re
plied that he wouldn't. " Why V
queried the man. " Why ?" echoed
the boy, "because dad died tin*

family, and how'«l F look lugging
