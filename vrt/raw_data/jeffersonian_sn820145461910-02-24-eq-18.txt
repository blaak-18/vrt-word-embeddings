Additional Letters From the People
WANTS LIVINGSTON “PUNCHED.”
Dear Sir:—As you will see, I am
a recent subscriber to your paper;
have only three copies, am sorry I
fiaven’t three hundred.
Feel that I’ve lost half of my life
for not having read it since its pub
lication. Many, many thanks to my
Lord and Master that He has chosen
a second Moses to lead His people out
of bondage, for our country is rotten
through and through.
Mr. Watson, may you, and, also,
your Christian friends never cease
praying to our Heavenly Father, till
your works are accomplished. Be
pugnacious, “go forward with a laud
able ambition that never fails,”
know no defeat, that is my prayer for
you.
“Foreign Missions.” Well, I hard
ly known what to say; am so dis
gusted with myself for being so
ignorant, must confess my ignor
ance as thousands ought to do.
Never knew where my money
went to before you told me.
Have always been a strong be
liever in Foreign Missions, and al
ways will be, but nothing suits me
more than the Pauline doctrine, and
never will I give another penny till
this subject is__cleared.
An enjoying your pieces on So
cialism.
And just beore closing, want to
add I am a Farmers’ Union member,
and insist that you bring our lead
ers to taw; and please don’t forget
to “punch” our old deserter, Living
ston, as often as possible.
Your friend,
T. A. COOK.
Oxford, Ga.
WHERE DOCTORS AGREE WITH
MR. WATSON.
Dear Sir: —Please allow one who
admires and endorses your recent at
tack on Foreign Missions to con
gratulate you and say your ideas on
the subject are correct and in ac
cordance with the teachings of the
Bible. There should be a limit.
Hoping you will continue in this
work, as you are now doing, and that
your readers may'ponder, linger and
think over the question of missions
very carefully, and pray over it be
fore doing other things, instead of
sending the Gospel. The Gospel alone
is what we are commanded to send,
and not hospitals, doctors, surgeons,
sanitariums, colleges, etc.
Now, with compliments of the sea
son and hearty good wishes, I re
main,
Very respectfully,
Respectfully,
A. H. WEATHERS, M. D.
Hawkinsville, Ga.
IX) NOT HIT TOO HARD FOR HIM.
Dear Sir:—l want to renew my
Jeff. I have been lost ever since
my subscription ran out. There is
no other paper for me.
I have been watching you ever
since 1895, and your work for the
people. You do not hit too hard for
me. I vote or nothing but the reer
endum. I have quit the old par
ties, -*-and would not touch them for
anything.
I do everything I can for you by
talking about you and your paper to
every one I come in contact with.
Your friend,
WM. J. REYNOLDS.

ANOTHER SCOT SPEAKS OUT.
Dear Sir:—Mr. Watson, you know
we Scotchmen at this time of the
year are all thinking of Robbie
Burns, the man who longed for, and
died lamenting that he couldn’t see
the time when “man to man the
world o’er should brithers be for a’
that.” You are doing more to bring
that time about than any other man
alive. And the time will come when
your birthday will be celebrated as
we celebrate poor Burns.
Yours.
JOHN GORDON.

SOCIALIST EDITORIALS SCAT
TERING FORCES ALREADY.
Dear Sir>—l am with you in your
fight for reform, socially, politically
and reliously. If we could only get
the people at large to read and think
along these lines there would be a
mighty transformation for good in a
short while.
Your articles on Socialism are
scattering the forces here already,
and by the unprejudiced and think
ing you are endorsed on the subject
of Missions. We are anxiously
awaiting your articles on Roman
Catholicism.
To my mind, it is the chidf of the
many evils with which we have to
contend/
I will prize the knife highly if you
can afford to send it.
Yours very truly,
J H FROST.
Bryan’s Mill, Texas.
BROTHER DUNBAR IS A SPLEN
DID MAN.
Dear Sir: —Enclosed you will find
two dollars for both your Jefferson
ians, and your knife as a premium.
I am highly pleased with your pa
pers: I endorse you in everything,
and especially what you say about
Brother William Dunbar. I am well
acquainted with him; he has convic
tions, and has the courage of them.
He is one preacher that I have the
highest admiration and esteem for.
I am so glad that you wrote up
Gordon Lee in his true colors. Hon.
M. L. Johnson is a true man, in every
sense, and I am going to do all in
my power to help elect him to Con
gress rfom the 7th district. Your
writings are better and better every
month. May God bless you in your
work for humanity,—the only man
of National reputation fighting for
the welfare of the masses.
Sincerely your friend,
A. H. TALLEY.

THIS FARMER HAS ENOUGH OF
MISSIONS AND DUCKWORTH.
Dear Mr. Watson:—As I am a
subscriber for your paper and also
a great admirer of your writing, I
wish to tell you that I am with you
on all you say as to Foreign Mis
sions. I am glad to know that some
brave editor has at last got after the
‘‘fat job” ministers of the foreign
fields, and the ones that beg the
money in the churches we poor farm
ers attend should be got after; for*
the city people I don’t care; they
are called on to pay out some of the
money they cheat the farmers out
Mr. Watson, I am glad you are
exposing the Catholics. I have
learned more of the Cotholic church
since I have been reading your writ
ings than I ever before knew.
Give it to that Duck, that feath
ers his own nest for Boodle and the
rest. I once joined the Union, but
pulled out. I saw that a few were
getting rich.
Mr. Watson, I_ am glad that you
did not take time out of your other
duties to debate with Ellis and
Broughton. You are doing more
good for your country and its peo
ple than eipier of those “loud-hol
lering” ministers ever have or will
do.
I am glad to see so many letters
from the people telling you how
much they enjoy your paper.
As for myself, I think it the finest
paper published. I received my
knife, and am very proud of it. I
appreciate it as much as I do my
paper, and that is a lot.
I will close, wishing you great suc
cess.
Very truly your friend and well
wisher,
W. B. McVEY.
Thomaston, Ga., Rt. 6.

EX-GOVERNOR MMES K. VARDAM/\N f S
PAPER FOR THE SOUTH
Published Every Saturday Morning at Jackson, Mississippi.
Vardaman was abused at first: he was called an agitator, an
alarmist, a firebrand; but at last the sober second thought of
the people began to waken and they began to listen. Today
what he has to say on the race problem, is the word of the su
preme authority. Combining all the knowledge or writers on
this question, from dawn of history to the present time, ap
plied and measured by personal observation and first-hand
knowledge, Governor Vardaman has a message to deliver of
huge import to the American people today.
