A NEGRO LYNCHED
HE WAS PULLED TO THE LIMB
OF A TREE.
He Assaulted Tom McDade of Bossier.
Fired at and Shot Harvey Con
nell, the Overseer.
Tuesday morning shortly after 6
o'clock a tragedy was enacted on the old
Knox Point plantation in Bossier about
twenty miles below Shreveport. A long
drawn out statement may be summar
ized in these words: Jim Brown, a ne
gro, occupied a cabin on the plantation
where he was employed. When awak
ened by Mr. Connell, the overseer, he
replied that he would not go to work
as his brother was in trouble. On re
porting this fact to Mr. McDade, who
is the owner of the plantation, Mr. Con
nell, was directed to return to the ne
gro's cabin and come with him to the lot
where he would give him his time. Jim
Brown dragged along in a sulky mood,
muttering to himself, until he reached
Mr. McDade who upbraided him for his
laziness. The negro rejoined with impu
dent words. Connell had started to the
commissary to get Brown's time when
he was startled by McDade calling him,
"Harvey! Harvey!" and as he faced
about saw the negro and Mr. McDade
struggling desperately. The negro held
a six-shooter in his right hand. As Con
nell rushed towards the combatants he
could not fire without endangering Mc
Dade. Suddenly the negro released his
.grasp on McDade and fired at Connell,
who was shot in the forearm, and a sec
ond shot struck him in the leg. Connell
was disabled and powerless to defend
himself or to assist McDade. The negro
then jumped aside and fired at McDade
and ran away. As the negro was fleeing
he was shot in the leg by Connell, who
had emptied his pistol.
A posse of white men was organized
and after a brisk ride Jim Brown was
captured, disarmed and hanged to a treei
near McDade station on the Shreveport
and ked River Valley road about half
a mile distant from the place where the
negro had shot Connell.
The negro was regarded with dlisfawv*ot,
He was shiftless and a disturbe of thel
peace, and in 'the moment of excitemeat
the outraged citizens became: tl. ju
the jury and the executioner at woe and
the same tine. Such action is not sur

Mary Grady,
Mhe Fearless
Woman Jailer
women vikings, but a few months
ago the skeleton of a woman bur
led with her horse and armor was
found in Norway. The fact that the
armor fitted the woman's skeleton "as
though she had been melted and
poured into it" proved beyond dispute
that there were also women vikings,
tremendous, fearless, full of fight.
The viking matter being settled for
good and all, it remains for the United
States today, twentieth century, to
show a woman who is keeper and
guard of a county pail-a jail, too,
where characters as desperate as any
in sins, both white and black, are
prisoned. That woman is Mary Grady,
the official jailer of Talladega county,
Ala. Talk of woman's weakness and
helplessness and dependence! Great
Mary Grady is 6 feet 4 inches tall and
large and strong in proportion. Maybe
she is the reincarnation of that same
tremendous viking ladywhowas buried
with her horse and armor in Norway
so many centuries ago. At any rate,
Mary Grady is brave, powerful and
real enough to be anything that mortal
can be, past, present or future.
In Talladega county the heroine is
called "Molly Grady." A correspondent
of the Sunny South prints an inter
view with her that ought to be read
aloud at city women's club meetings.
The story would be so refreshing.
The interviewer found that Molly
Grady had had charge of Talladega
jail six years, and no prisoner escaped
during her term. She is "deeply in
earnest," and that accounts for much
of her greatness. The way she got her
regular appointment was through frus
trating an attempted jail delivery.
That is so good a story it must be told
by itself. Molly's brother, wrongfully
accused, it turned out, was a prisoner
in Talladeg jail. Molly went repeat
edly to see him. Once the man who
was ailer -at the time had to go to
the village on .sa errand while Molly
was at the prison. She could not get
to her .jl lborne because of a storm
that was rigng, It Was after dark
that the diler atarted to the village.

again. She had no gun, but he did not

and let him out, telling him to stand

FILMY AND DIAPHANOUS.
Character of the New Summer Things.
Elegant Lace Gowns.
More filmy and diaphanous than ever
will be the gowns for the coming sum
mer-that is, the present outlook would
so indicate-but I have seen in the
spring so many things planned for sum,
mer that never saw the light of day
that I do not exactly like to profess to
be a prophet of infallibility. We know
that the stores are full of all sorts of
delicate and dainty things such as prop
erly belong to the long, warm summer
days, and that all who have the means
to do so are now buying the first fruits
of the loom, to be made up in the pri
vacy of their homes during the quiet
of Lent. Nearly all the wash dresses
and much of the handsome attire in
tended to be worn "for nice" in some
fashionable summer resort will be
made then.
Almost everything save the percales
and chambreys have more or less open
work in the goods, and when there is a
dress to be made where the material is
solid so much inset work is put into the
garment that it, too, becomes transpar
ent to a greater or lesser degree.
Foremost and first come the all lace
dress patterns. Cream and white
lierre laces are made wide enough so
that one width is long enough for a
uEGANT LACE GOWNS.
full skirt. Some of the designs have
the skirt proper still further added to
by an extra flounce some six inches
deep, carrying the same figure rs that
in the skirt, and this is laid around the
bottom .of the skirt and just above a
chiffon ruffle, with a close little ruche
to set it out. The chiffon ruffle is set
on a 411k skirt which the lace skirt
falls over. When the lace is dead
white, .t has a richer effect it the silk
is creem ;o ivory. Not only is lierre
offered, but ceam and white French
pebntd'.uprit lace, and this is made up
like any kind of thin goods, with tucks
and bverlaying of .black or white lace.
This makes tp into extremely pretty
gowns, lbut is not so dressy as the
heavier renaissance and Irish point
gowns. There is also a novel and very
effective arrangement of fne batiste,
with applications of lace of various
kinds let in in places. Some have a
combination of the batlste and net, and
these have the merit of being eatr.ely
new.
Handsome gowns are produced of
black silk mull with inset stripes of
black lace Insertion, and this is set
lengthwise down the skirts to the deep
graduated lounce. Where the flounce
joins the rest is a band of black lace
gulpare, and lower down on each fan
shaped fold is placed a rosette of black
satin ribbon. This dress is one easy to
copy and handsome when done. The
waist is a blouse, with insets of inser
tion, and the sleeves are of the mull,
with a-deep fall of the mull and inser
tion set up and down like all the rest.
The mull of which the skirt is made
has the insertion laid in between, and
three widths are put at the bottom of
each line to form the flounce. The
muil is cut in slashes wider at the bot
tom than the top, -and they are upheld
by the lace insertion flounce beneath.
It makes a superb gown for a young
natron.
A home gown made of white chiffon
with applique and thin taffeta is
shown. This dress, worn over a deli
cately colored lining, would be beauti
fuL Speaking of ribbon reminds me
to say that ribbon is to be seen itf not
hear the coming season. In fact, it is
already beginning to be noticed. This
is as it should be, for aside from lace
nothti is so delightful as ribbon. The
Aibbess of the season are in all the
synd~iate colors and are satin faced
liberty, double faced satins, very rich,
and plain taffetas. Black velvet rib
boa as a finish is not quite so generally
ueed, but it has by no means fallen
l.te that awful abyss' where all 'old
thhaoar go and whose depths no one
has sounaded.
S.sl-aml is to be one of the dress
materials for the coming season, not
iitk eve ing gowns, but also for al
'es " afternoon occasion. Silk mull
ist eally strong and does not crush and

CONKEY'S HOME JOURNAL.
Conkey's Home Journal for March
contains in addition to its usual quota of
interesting departments for women, sev
eral special articles and good short sto

Rexford. "A Belated Romance" is the
title of a new serial by Helen Clark
Balmer. A splendid article for women
with excellent illustrations is on "Beau

A Willful Misunderstanding.
Pitt was induced by Sir John Sin
clair to constitute a board of agricul
ture toward the end of the eighteenth
century and make him the president
Having enjoyed his office for a few
years, Sinclair began to desire promo
tion in the social scale. "Dear Mr.
Pitt," he wrote to the prime minister,
"don't you think the president of the
board of agriculture should be a peer?"
"Dear Sir John Sinclair," replied
Pitt, "I entirely agree with you. I
have therefore appointed Lord Somer
ville to succeed you as president of the
board of agriculture."
Sir John Sinclair went about wring
ing his hands and exclaiming: "Dear
me, dear me! It was such a willful
misunderstanding!" - Fortnightly Re
view.
nelduly Explained.
The colonel stopped his team before
the cabin of an Arkansas squatter to
say to the man sitting on a log at the
door:
"When I was along here a month ago
and asked you how far it was to Col
fax, you said it was twelve miles. It's
only nine. Why didn't you 'say nine?"
"It was the old woman's fault," re
plied the squatter. "I wasn't suah
whether it was nine or twelve, and so
I went in and axed her. She reckoned
it was twelve, and I had to reckon the
tame or have a row. When I reckoned'
as she reckoned, she reckoned that
you'd reckon it was twelve miles nigh
enough, and I reckon you reckoned that
way."
The Beautital Turquoise.
The turquoise is considered as a talis
man in Persia, its native soil. It pre
serves its possessor from accidents and
insures constancy in affections. The
value of the turquoise depends on its
shade and its size, especially its thick
ness. Those classed as belonging to the
old rock are valued very highly. Em
blem of yTuth, of sentiment and tender
recollections, the turquoise may be
called the forget-me-not of stones.
