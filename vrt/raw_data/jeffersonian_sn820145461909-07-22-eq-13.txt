and see her when she ain’t mine
would kill me! When must me and
Jethro go home, Doctor?”
“I think the sooner the better for
both; tomorrow morning, say.”
“All right,” replied Lauretta, with
the calmness of despair. “Jethro’s
uptown somewheres; tell him —and
we’ll go!”
The baby stirred on the cot.
“Mam, mam!’’ she murmured, open
ing her eyes sleepily. Lauretta took
her up very quietly and rocked her
to sleep, her mind still trying to
grasp the awful problem of death
and no death. The baby would be
alive, well, cared for, yet dead to
her; as dead as if she were buried
underground, with the worms crawl
ing over her poor, pale face! Lau
retta shuddered involuntarily at the
horrible thought. “I’ll give her to
the nuss,” she whispered, w r ith stiff
lips. “Tell Jethro, doctor, and we’ll
be a-gwine home.”
The cart creaked heavily through
the sand; Jethro walked beside it
and Lauretta sat up on the roll of
bedding within. Her hands were
crossed idly in her lap, a far-off, un
seeing look in her apathetic eyes.
“We’re ’most there, honey,” said
Jethro cheerfully; “we’ll soon be a
gittin’ home.”
On through the woods where the
hands w r ere busily collecting turpen
tine from the “boxed” trees; past
heavily laden wagons, hauling bar
rels of the crude turpentine to the
still, past the still where the spirits
were manufactured and where the
dwelling of the boss and the com
pany’s commissary were located. Still
farther, past the small shacks of the
hands, till at last their own was
reached, a small, lonely cabin in the
heart of the forest; no garden, no
poultry, no dog even to welcome the
returned travelers —the very “abomi
nation of desolation.”
And here they lived on. Jethro
spent his days at work in the forest,
sometimes miles away, and Lauretta
saw him only at night. All day, when
she was not busy preparing their
scanty meals, she sat in the doorway
and gazed, with unseeing eyes, into
the forest. But there was a night
when Jethro came home from the
woods with a congestive chill. Lau
retta piled all the quilts in the house
on him and gave him hot “yerb teas.”
A passing turpentine hand summon
ed the few neighbors to her aid.
They did what they could, but the
chill still held him in its death-cold
clutches. The next morning Jethro
Dismukes, white, occupation laborer,
was no longer on the payroll.
The company’s carpenter made
him a coffin of pine plank, lined it
with sleazy white muslin and cover
ed it with black calico, and the
neighbors bore the body of the moun
taineer to the burying-place among
the pines. The boss read a psalm
over the grave, the neighbors sang
a hymn and then went home.
One of the neighbor women stayed
with Lauretta that night, and the
boss came over and paid her the lit
tle bit of money that was coming to
Jethro. He also offered to buy her
poor household furnishings, and, if
she wished, he would send her to
town, where she might take the train
for her native State and go to her
own people.
Lauretta’s heart leaped. Home and
mother and the mountains! They
had seemed so far away and she
never expected to see them again.
She eagerly accepted his offer,
and, the day after her husband’s
burial, seated in the boss’s own
buggy, drawn by swift horses, Lau
retta was on her way to town. One
of the hands, an old and stupid ne
gro, drove her. The boss had given
minute directions about the trains,
the price of her ticket, etc., but Lau
retta paid little heed to his instruc
tions. Her mind was formulating a
plan of her own—a desperate plan,
fraught with danger, yet causing her
heart to sing with joy at the thought!
She would steal her baby!
The nurse, in her search for the
child, Avould of course go to the tur
pentine camps. The boss would tell
her that Lauretta had taken the
train at the station. Then she would
question the ticket agent and train
men; Lauretta exulted to think how
completely at a loss Miss Lathrop
would be when she found no trace of
her there. For she did not intend
to take a train at that place; no, in
deed she would take her baby and
walk miles and miles away, till she
came to another town where there
was a railroad. If necessary, she
would walk to the mountains; God
would show her the way. The little
tobacco bag of money in her bosom
would buy food. She would get
along—if she only had her baby!
At the edge of the town she bade
the driver halt. She wanted to visit
a friend who lived nearby, she said
and could easily walk to the depot.
She took her small bundle —contain-
ing precious things for the baby
under her arm and walked swiftly
along. She had thought out the
whole plan, and was now ready to
act. It was early morning, for they
had left the turpentine camp before
dawn, to avoid the sultry September
sun. Nurse Lathrop would be get
ting breakfast in the kitchen, and the
baby would be asleep—and alone.
She knew the way, for she had.
carried her baby to the house that
dreadful morning. Very few people
were stirring, only a few workmen
hurrying to their work and now and
then a delivery wagon rattling by,
taking orders from customers. No
body noticed Lauretta. She reached
the house without difficulty. All
the doors and windows were open
to let in the morning coolness.
She laid her bundle down at the gate;
she stealthily lifted the latch, leav
ing the gate ajar, walked swiftly but
silently up the path, crept, on tiptoe,
through the open hall door and into
Miss Lathrop’s room.
Miss Lathrop’s bed was empty, but
in a small, white-enameled crib,
dalintily draped with the thinnest
and whitest of canopies, lay sleeping
a tiny bundle of delight—a baby,
rosy and warm, one pearly arm be
neath the head covered with silky
ringlets; long black lashes sweeping
its rose-flushed, dimpled cheeks;
clad all in snowy cambric and finest
lace, a veritable child of luxury, yet
—her baby!
Her hungry eyes drank in its
beauty, her starved lips yearned to
touch its dimpled fingers. Her heart

beat to suffocation, but no sound
came from her lips; a moment she
gazed, then quickly, softly gathered
the sleeping child to her bosom,
threw over it the loose folds of her
homespun apron, and swiftly, steal
thily, scarce daring to breathe, crept
again through the hall, down the
steps, out into the street, where she
caught up the bundle, half dragging,
half carrying it, and, unmolested and
unseen, hurried on and on till the
welcome cool green woods were all
around her.
Miss Lathrop ate her early break
fast with tranquility. She knew at
what hour the baby usually awoke,
and always arranged it so that her
morning work should be done be
fore it was time to attend to her
nursling. As she finished her last
task she thought, “The baby’s late
about waking; the morning’s so cool
she’s enjoying her nap,” and, with a
smile on her lips, she walked softly
to the empty crib and looked in.
Horror froze the scream that died
in her throat. She stood benumbed
with fear; but, the moment her
shocked brain resumed its power to
think, she instinctively realized the
truth —Lauretta, and no other, had
stolen her baby! She flew to the
telephone and called frantically for
Dr. Lorrimer. That young man, in
a deep slumber, after a hard night’s
work, was aroused with difficulty;
but, when he comprehended the
nurse’s incoherent message, he or
dered his buggy, dressed in haste and
was at her door in as short a time
as possible, though it seemed ages to
the waiting woman.
“She stole my baby!” she wailed,
“Lauretta has stolen my baby! I feel
it, I know it! When I came in from
the kitchen her crib was empty—
my little, warm, sweet baby!”
“Yes,” said the young doctor quiet
ly, “little and warm and sweet —her

mother’s arms must have been empty
without her!” Then, speaking in his
usual quick, decisive fashion: “Lau
retta will surely return to the tur
pentine camps, though she is prob
ably hiding somewhere now. My
buggy is at the gate and I see you
are ready. We will go at once.”
On the road to the camp the doc
tor was unusually silent. The nurse,
absorbed in her grief, paid little at
tention to anything, only urging him
to make all the speed possible. It
was noon when they reached their
destination. The boss had just come
in from the woods for dinner. He
was a family man, and, as he stood
by the buggy, listening to Miss La
throp’s story, a little two-year-old
boy held fast to his father’s finger.
“I don’t reckon it’ll be worth
while to wait till she comes back,”
he said slowly, “on account of her
takin’ the train this moring for her
old home, som’er’s in the mountains
up in No’th Ca’lina. Jethro bein’
dead and buried and her havin’ no
relations here, ’cept her child”—his
hand wandered caressingly over the
curly locks of his own—“and it be
longin’ to you, in a manner, I ad

folks and sent her to town ’fore day

friends. So, on the wfliole, ma’am, I

Lord, it ain’t a circumstance to what

sometimes for a gourd o’ water, and
