Pelhaps the first object in an Eu
glish barnyard to arrest the attention
of an American observer would be
the appearance of the stack-barton.
Every hay-stack is neatly raked anti
pulled by hand, so as to present a firm
front to the weather; the bottom is
bevelled out with a bay-knife to the
extent of three or four feet, and the
top surmounted by a tapering and
picturesque covering of haulu sufli
cient to withstand the heaviest rain.
storm and effectually resist the in
clkmencies of winter. The stacks (Eu
glish agriculturists seldom preserve
their produce in covered barns, as is
the custom here) are, for thle most
parts, constructed on an elevated
staddle, supported at the tour angles
by hewn stone pillars, surmounted
by caps of the same material, but of
touch greater diameter, so as to Ire
vent rats and other vermin, that
cannot progress in an inverted posi
tion, form getting into the mow.
These, too, are protected by a cover
ing of haulm, and remain iu position
until a conveneant time arrives for
Sthreshing, which operation is per.
fIrmed by an itinerant traternity, as
in this country, though almost invari
able by steam power. One of the
greatest stock-yard coinveniences- in
deed, in a climate so noted for its
changeability, an almost indispensa
ble adjunct -is the patent "Rick cov
er," an appliance calculated, in some
degree, to obviate the ill effects .of
summer rain storms. These articles
are made of various sizes, to suit
every requirement, the covering be
ing of waterproof canvas, suspended
tentwise, upon a crossbar pendent
between two uprights. The whole is
elevated and kept in position by
means of pulleys, the operation ot
erecting or taking down occupying
but a few minutes, while the canvas
can be raised or lowerel at will, as
the progress of the stack necessitates.
Another noticeable feature is the barns
and outbuildings-solid struetures of
brick or limestone, covered ,yai rloof
ing of tile or slate.: These ' also pre

work being neatly painted, and the,
approach well stoned and tfree from
filth. Among many landowners a
custom prevails of painting the out
buildings, gates and fences, on their
different estates, of one uniform color,
so that persons cognizant of the fact
may tell, at a glance, to whom a
homestead or close of land belongs.
The color adopted by Sir Charles
Mordaunt on his West of England es
tate is a deep dark red, the material
employed being a patent, ready mixed

mature experience has shown the pd

this rule is now universally adopted.
