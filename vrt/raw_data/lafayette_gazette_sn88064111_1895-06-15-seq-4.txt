About seventy-five scows, and miser
ably -.constructed . cabins, securely
tperched upon heavy logs, constitute
the village of Esllelujah Harbor. To
4 become a member of society in this
quiet'town there are two requisites:
m First, the new-comer mnst own his
th little shack; and, second, must have
sense enough to strictly mind his own
business. There are no credentials re
" quired as to race, sex, color or previous
- occupation. Sunday is a big d'ay.over
at the harbor. The folks do not boast
d about their church-going proclivities.
yThey prefer to stay home and do a little
h laundry work; to sew on a few needed
r buttons, and loaf andsmoke during the
afternoon.
It was this careless spirit that a few
rh months ago induced several of the Sal
vation Army sodldiers to take up their
abode in the midst of what was then
known as Scowville. Even the enthu
siasm of the ardent devil fighters, ac
ly centuated by the big bass drum, and
in the shouts of glory from the army lads
and lasses, could not wake the "'wicked"
P fisherman from their lethargy, and the
a recruits were flnalg called home.
From the time of lr departure
a Scowville has been kn as Halle
ir lujah Harbor.
* The cabins are mostly about 16x10
L. feet in size, divided into two rooms, a
kitchen and a bedroom. The dwellers
do their own cooking, living chiefly on
bread, bacon, potatoes, flour gravy,
fish and game. The cost of such a bill
y of fare rarely exceeds one dollar a
d week. Some of the houses are very
e neatly kept, though the majority woe
fully show the need of the hand of
gentle woman.
In this curious little city are French
men, Germans, Swedes, Italians and
Irishmen. all living in perfect har
mony. On moonlight evenings they
congregate on one of the largest rafts,
and as several of them are performers
on musical instruments quite an or
chestra is formed, and many a pleasant
evening hour is thus whiled away.
During the summer months the
dwellers of Hallelujah Harbor fish,and
in the winter they hunt. They are at
liberty to go and come when they
please. The waters of the sound are
r open to them for the plying of their
vocation the year around, and they
live their simple lives month in and
month out, perfectly independent of
the great, big, bustling city under
whose shadow they nightly rest.-Ta

HE FORGOT THE TICKETS..
But Ho Hadn't Intended to Mentlon the
Fact to His wire.
Y Dinner was over, and Mr. Snapshot
had seated himself cozily before the
fire to peruse the evening paper. After
a few anxious glances at him his wife
I remarked:
"I hope you haven't forgotten that
we are going to the new play to-night,
Josephu ?"
s Her husband gave a guilty start.
"Of course I haven't forgotten; I
never forget anything; but it is early,
_ and I want to read my paper in peace,
i not in pieces."
After this scorching snub Mrs. Snap
shot was silent for five minutes, then
she observed:
"It seems to me that everybody I a
know is going to-night, and I'm so
glad that I got my new bonnet home I
in time-it was only by dint of tele- a
phoning to the milliner every half
I hour that I did so."
"Humph! If you kept the woman at
the telephone all day how hid you ex
pect her to find time to make your bon
net?"
"You don't know anything about
milliners, Joseph us. I do hope our
seats are good ones. Mrs. Illanqu3 told
me that there was such a crowd at the
box office that she ruined her lovely t
new sleeves in getting hers. She says
there will not even be standing room
to-night."
Mr. Snapshot looked anxious. "By a
the way, my-dear, while you were tele
phoning I suppose you called up the
laundryman and told him to send my
things; I haven't a shirt in the house
fit to wear to-night."
"Oh, Josephus; 1 never once thought
of it."
"Of course not. We will just remain U
at home then."
"But, dear, the one you are wearing I
is plenty clean enough; you only put
it on-"5
"Thank you, I don't care to go look- d
ing like a sweep, while you-"
"Couldn't--couldn't you send over
and borrow one from Mr. Blanque? I'm
so sorry I forgot."
"And have Mr. Blanque say that you
spend all my money on dress while I
haven't a shirt to my back ! And when
I particularly wanted to go to-night,
too;" it is too much."
He turned to his paper in silent maj- B
esty, and it was an hour before his
wife ventured to ask meekly: "Shall
you be able to exchange the tickets
dear."
"The tickets-what ticketes?" said
Mr. Snapshot absent-mindedly, as he
ran his eye along the column: "I didn't
fget the tickets; forgot all about it un
til it was too late and-look here,
Amaryellis Snapshot, if I am never to
be allowed to read my paper at home
in peace I shall get a divorce and mar
ry a deaf mute, that's what I'll de."

VELOCITY OF A CANNON BALL.
Its Mesaurement by a simple and certesn
5 Yrocess.
T How to measure the velocity of a
its feprojectile in its light from a light
seems to the uninrtiated a diffan riverlt
problem, and yet it amounts to little
SFlore than just the division of tha cer
wotain space passedgrowth over by the time
which it has taken to do this, both
space and time being determined by
measurement and apparatus in the
simplesthycharacter. Somewhere in the
woopath of the projectile are placed two
wire screens, eachnt formed of a simple
frame across which a mire runs back
and forth, forming part of an electric
battery circuit in which an accurate
timepiece is also interposed. As
the projectile, on being fiand are
from the gun, passes through
the frst screen, the circuit
of which it is a part is broken and the
clockwork is started, the index origi
nally pointing to zero. On passing
throrgh the second screen the projectile
interrupts the second circuit, with the
effect o instantly bringing de the elock
mechanism to a stop. Knowing then
the exprojact distance between the two
screens, usually seoeram hundred feet,
it follows that by dividing it by the
number of seconds or the fan actions of
a second marked on the clock dial, rep
resenting the time which has elapsed
during the passage of the projectile
from screen to screen, the obtain the
number of iieet is a per second which the
projectile was to zavelling. On paothing
much simpler could well be devised,
the whole secret of catisfactory meas
urement lying in the accuracy of the
time determination, in which even so

second becomes a factor of the utmost
