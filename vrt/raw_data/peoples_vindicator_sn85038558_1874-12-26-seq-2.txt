The Villainy Consumated.
Consideriig the threats and characs
ter of the Radieals, we are not as
tonished at the news conveyed as by
this weeks telegramsp and. mail, but
we are nevertheless filled with pro
found indignation! that our rights and
liberties should be thus far tampered
with. It now remains to be seen
what ftrther arbitrary action will be
taken by these men, and how the Re
turning Board intend to make good
their count.
In our parish the action is one so
villainous as to demand prompt in
vestigation; the throwing out of
wards 5 and 6, two of the largest
white wards in the parish, is a meas
ure which wil'l meet our undying re
sistance. No frands or intimidations
were committed, at these boxes, for
the election was held under thm ap
pervisionu nd control of two Radicqls
to one Cyuservative commissioner, as
per agreement with their candidates,
that in the wards where there were
known to be a majority of white and
Conservative voters, the Raa!;als
should have two of the commis
sioners, and in wards known to be
Radical tlde Conservatives wee to
lhave a miajerity of comumissioira.
The tigureiug of Ray is apparent, for
with the increase of 70 votes for
Twitchel in Red River, and 311 in
Natchitoehes, with, DeSoto thrown
out, the thieving Senator is elected
over Elam by. 3' otes. 'It would be'
an insult to. our people to suppose
that we will'sIbmit for a moment to
this outrage, on the contrary, such ana
tion only renders us more deiterin.-.
ed never to give our adhesion to the:
Kellogg government. We ere deter-;
mined from, this hour to. eoer pay to
that govermmest onm dollar of Tase,
and' we. will resist its oplcers to the
death wiao attempt to afor4. it. We,
the whites of Louisiana, repreent
ing all its wealth, all its iatelligeune,
all its respectability, are entitled to
eq~nql, right and privilege beiore
the law,.aud by the great God we amv
determined to assett them.
"Is thy sevadnt a dog," that hey
slnld he asked to dubmit, tp ever-y
thing, :We have borno all that we
intend ta ear and if Kellogg anod his
crew are prepared to stand the con
sqqen eeq, well pad good. The hour
has come for every arN in Louisiana
to do his duty; no diplomatic ave
nue of escape is left us, for which
thank Heav e; our liberties are being
torn from us, we are standing on the
verge of ruia and degradation, aad
the only escape the feelings and
pride of manhood has' left is an ap
peal to that law which the Creator
has written in the breast of every
living creature, "and before whose
thunqders despots have fallen and ur
tions arisen in freedom-the law of
self proteeton.n
Let the paid press howl over this
as a war agirnst the Umiop, a war qf
races, but we wil not be deterred;
Kellogg is not the negro, nor is Grat,
the Union. We yield to none in one
feslty to the Uaibs and tie Om'tits.

contempt this fool outrage upon onu
libertiqes, this Kellogg swindle and

The hnst cup of a frolic-A hic-cup.
Organs of Radicalism.
The Radical press of Louisiana has
.one virtue at least, if it can be so
classed, :and that is, it follows out
the. oldap trite maxim, that a good
lie tcel stuck too, amounts to some
thing like.the trath-to those who tell
it.
We are reminded of this in noting
the tenacity with which these "theives
own," cling to the "bloody shirt" and
"outragelie" business; and know that
there seems to exist no further occa
sion to repeat the prevarications of
the "Buareau of Justice" at Washing
ton, and that the whole Northern
press, both Republican and Deuocrat
ic, only refer to such statements as
"downright lies;" it seems ludicrous,
and the farce should end after such a
"set down" as these people were the
recipienits of on the 3d of last No
vember. We are sure they will pro
duce but one effect, and that disgust,
by flaunting their worn-outfalsehoods
in the face of the American citizens
who have so overwhelmingly con
damned them.
What can a decent people think of
a wretch, who would blazou to the
light of 'day an applogy for such
fiends jas Merrill, Hodgeon, Seeyle,
DeRlulio and- we were going to
say McIntosh qnd Stockton, but their
craven cowardice amplly m a k e s
amemnds for other qualities which are
lacking in them.
This the Radical press, wo are
paid by their mighty, friends in rma
cajity Kellogg and Packard, does,
and with that fawning and grinning
grace that distinguishes a lick dog
from a man.. As a corps of liars and
thieves; as defenders of eut throats
and villains, the Jiadical Press of
Loalsiase would. take the premium
even over, the "Odial Jeounai of
his Santatrpo "ajesty in hell, where
all these fawning, cringing, hounds
will be put to work, when earth Is'o
longer cumbered with such disgraces
to hutnanity.
Crumbs f tomf brt
This Judieiaf and Senatorial Distrite
are composed of the same parishes-i
De8oto, lied $legy, Shaine and Nat
chitoches; and the threwiag out of
De8eto entire-wards Sand 6 of Na,
cbhitoohes, 4 of Sabine and 8 of red
River, gives Twitheel 102 majority
for the Senate, which, taking it all It
all, is the most glaring and villainous'
fraud that ever was perpetriated upon
a people.. Time must determine
whether this will saucceed or not.
But the "powers that bed" attempt,
in a clumsy manner, to soothe our
feelings with the crumb (and we must
say a truly small morsel).of thejudi,
ciary of the 17th District, in place of
the notorious Judge H. C. Myers, and
Dist. Att'y. J. E. Breda. Is this not
adding insult to all the iqjarie we
have received, to suppose for a mo
mient, that we woulad be sasisfid'to
give up our justly earned jewel of
victory for suclks worthles. h ahle

Resolutions of the Committee

Whereas, the Returaing Beard of

have ignored the rpmerons dfidavire.
of registered citizens of this parish,
who have proven beyond doubt that
they themselves, as well as many
other of our registered citizens, have
been unjustly, fraudulently, by vio
lence and intimidation, deprived of
their tights to vote the People's tick
et at the late election wards 9, 10
and II, in this parish, through the
illegal workings and machinations of
certain leaders and members of the
Republisan party, and refused. to
throw out boxes 9 and 10, as they
were in justice and in duty bound to
do, acordilg to the facts brought to
their notice. in aid afidavits, and un
der the law.
And wheties, the maid Returning
Board bave thrown out the boxes in
wards 5 and, 6, in which a large ma.
jority had been given to the candi

parish, at t~se last election, upon the.
f:tm and' lying affidavits Of certain
