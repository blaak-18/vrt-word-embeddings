Sapides and the State Convention.
After the adoption of the name ot
White Man'« Party on Satarday
last, the Mass Meeting sent dele
gates to the Convention to meet at
Baton Ronge on the 4th Mouday of
the present month.
Had the call been made by the
Democratic Central Committee
alone, it is doubtful whether this
meeting wonld have sent delegates,
as anxioas as it was to secure peace
and harmony. As we understand,
public sentiment here, it is iu favor
first of taking that action best cal
culated to secure the election ot our
three members of the Legislature
and our Parish officers. They are
then willing to lend all the assis
tance in their power to the election
of the State Treasurer and the six
Congressmen to be elected on the
State ticket. The sentiment here
is almost universal that this is a lo
cal contest and that the issues in
volved have nothing to do with any
party. Onr people are unwilling to
stake their chances of winning up
on the success of any party, other
than a party to be composed of all
the honest and intelligent white
people regardless of all past polit
ical affiliations. There being in this
canvass no conceivable difficulty in
the way of separating the State and
parish campaigns, we have adopt
ed the White Man's Party for our
parish, as being the name and pro
gramme best calculated to secure
the success of our parish ticket.—
This determination as far as our
parish is concerned, is fixed and
unalterable. No change is desired
or desirable. The White Man's
Party will conduct thecampaigu to
the end in this parish.
Having decided upon this couree
of action for this parish, the Mass
Meeting was, of course, anxious to
do nothing that would be inconsis
tent with this action", and the ouly
objection to sending delegates to
the Baton Rouge Convention was
the fear that it might compromise
us. This apprehension was allayed
by the address fit the Committee of
Seventy anil the meeting appointed
delegates who go as the represen
tatives of the White Man's Party,
to a People's Convention, and as a
strong "element opposed to Radi
calism," and as an element necessa
ry to the success of the State ticket.
We publish below an editorial
from the Shreveport Times, which
has been in the lead in the call for
a people's Convention at Alexan
dria, from which it will be seen that
it puts the saine interpretation up
on the status of that Convention
that our Mass Meeting did :
action of the committer ok sevextv.
"Monday we received a dispatch from
Now Orleans, which was accidently omit
ted in '»ur yesterday's issue. stating that
the Democratic Central Committee had
changed the place for the assembling of its
Convention to Katon Rouge, and that the
Committee of Seventy would join in a call
for a people's convention to assemble at
the same place : luit the dispatch did not.
st .ii to whether or not t.lie Democratic Com
mittee had consented to a people's conven
tion. At a late hour last, night, we re
ceived the dispatch pnldished in> another
column, giving the action of the Commit
tee of Seventy last night. That actios
will, without doubt he entirely satisfacto
ry to the people of North Louisiana and
all others who endorsed flu- call for a Con
veution at Alexandria. The compromise
is entirely acceptable to 11», ami it is to lie
hoped the Democratic Committee will
concur in it; should it not do so, the res
ponsibility of any division will rest upon
its members. Let every parish conven
tion send delegates to the People's Con
vention at Ilatoll Ronge pledged to the
White Man's movement. We herewith
withdraw the call for a Convention at Al
exandria, believing we are carrying out
the wishes of our people, and trusti >g
that our contemporaries who have co-op
eruted with us in this important move
ment will do likewise."
We do not presume that there
will be drawn any party lines iu
the Convention, and if any such
lines are drawn of course our dele
gates will not be admitted. If the
Convention is tô b«s as we under
stand it, a Convention of all the peo
ple to consult as to their best inter
ests, then we will go in and as far
as the State campaign is concerned,
Rapides stands pledged to support
the Convention and its* nominees—
and our delegates will act in per
fect harmony with the majority of
the Convention^
C^The special meeting of the
Police Jury called for Thursday
last, was a failure for want of a
quorum, and was adjourned over
to the regular meeting in Septem
ber. Exit rail road ?
The Mass Meeting Last Saturday.
The meeting of the people of this
parish on Saturday last, was one of
the largest, most harmonious and
entlinsiastic ever held in this parish,
and we may add, the most impor
tant one in the history of Rapides
The representative men, as well as
the rank and file, from all quarters
and sections of the parish, were
present and all weie animated with
the single purpose of securing uni
ty and harmony. All were ready
to give up their particular views of
policy, an«l ready to agree to what
ever might be determined npon by
the majority. This was all as it
should be, and proves that old Ra
pides is still true to her past histo
ry and that she is determined to be
behind none of her sister parishes
iu the glorious^work of redeeming
Louisiana. We publish elsewhere
a report in full of the proceedings,
as well as the resolutions adopted
by the meeting.
We can find no language suited
to express onr gratification and un
alloyed pleasure that the meeting
adopted the name o* White Man's
Party. The enthusiasm with which
this name was adopted is a guaran
ty ot its popularity with our peo
ple, and npon this platform every
White Man in the parish will unite,
and to its banner they will rally to
a man. No other party could ac
complish this result here. The
campaign hero under the control
and direction of the White Man's
Party will be made with that nnau
ininity and enthusiasm that will
and has already insured the suc
cess of our ticket this Fall.
To our long suffering people we
can now and do offer words of com
fort and good cheér. The end of
radical misrule iu this parish, if not
in the State, is drawing to a close
and November will witness onr fi
nal and glorious victory over the
hordes of radical thieves and ne
gro plunderers.
After some debate as to the sta
tus our delegates would occupy
there, a list of forty delegates, em
bracing the names of some of our
best citizens who have in the past
had no connection with politics,
were appointed ami ratified, to rep
resent Rapides in the Convention
to assemble at Baton Ronge oil the
4th Monday of the present month.
These delegates, go as the represen
tatives of the White Man's Party,
to the Convention under the joint
call of the Democratic Central Com
mittee and the Committee of Sev
enty, not to any party Convention,
but to a Convention of the people
to consult as to their best interests.
The Parish Central Committee
appointed by the meeting are now
charged with the conduct of the
campaign in this parish and upon
them devolve grave and important
duties which they well appreciate
and which they are prepared to per
form to the strict letter of the law,
without hesitation or Hindling —
They will go right to work and nev
er cease until thecampaigu shall be
over, and until our candidates,
about whose election there is no
shadow of doubt, shall have been
installed in their offices. We con
gratulate our people upon the cer
tain success which will now attend
their efforts to secure au honest and
capable administration of our par
ish affairs. This time our nomina
tions are equivalent to election, and
negro radicalism will have to take a
back seat. We needed but to be
united to win and now that we are
all united our success is assured.
Just such a spirit as now actu
ates our people is what we have
needed all along to enable us not
only to win, but to secure the
fruits of our victory . The
Mass Meeting was unanimous in
their expression of this resolution,
and the quiet determination dis
played 1 here bod»^s no good to the
perpetrators of any attempt to de
fraud us of any ot our rights.
T he " C ircus" E tc .—We knew
it.! The Democrat after sneering at
the Rapides Cemetery Association,
now comes out with strong Metho
dist doctrine about spending money
to see the ''Circus," "Menagerie"
etc., Bah ! The Rail Road must be
iu a desperate condition when its
advocates preach sacrilege to the
dead in one breath and straight
laced Puritanism in another.
White Men Stand ^7 Tour Saoe.
Never before were we so thor
oughly convinced that it is the dn
ty of the white people of Rapides,
and the whole State, to give sup
port and employment to all labor
ing n h ite men over negroes, as we
are now. We have iu our commu
nity old and tried mechanics, who
have always been true to the best
interest ot our Parish and State,
who have stood by us for almost a
quarter of a century, through pros
perity as well as adversity. They
are now iu need of employment,
and are suffering in many instan
ces for the common necessaries of
life, to support themselves and their
families. They will not abandon
their old homes, old associates and
fr^ndly ties, so long as there is a
hope of weathering the adverse tide
of our misfortunes. They are true
and tried, and whenever the hour
comes for action iu defense of our
principles and onr homes, they will
always be found in the foremost
ranks, battling with the noblest
and bravest of the brave.
There is work tor them, and our
planters, merchants and every class
ot our white people should give
them preference, and see that ne
groes who are our political enemies,
iu fact public enemies, shall not
have employment where a white
man can be found that will do the
work. The chief leader of the ne
groes, Tom Cokely, whose whole
time is taken up just now, in secret
ly organizing negro clubs at mid
night, and arousing the bitterest
and most vindictive feelings of the
uegrö race against the whites, has
we understood, made his threats
that he and his negro carpenters
would drive away the white me
chanics from the Parish by under
bidding them. This negro by far
the worst one ill this Parish, has
recently obtained from the "Radical
School Board, a nice little job for
putting up a school house, at the
public expense where it is content
plated that the poor white trash as
they call us, will be compelled to
send their children to a mixed
school of negroes and whites. ,
This contract was let out private
ly, without allowing bids from
white mechanics, and at the ex
pense of the white tax-payers and
propel ty holders. This bloated
and impudent negro for his politi
cal influence among the ignorant
negroes, obtained the contract, and
in this way is to be supported.
Will we longer support vipers to
burn and sting ns? Will we give
employment to such a class of pub
lic enemies, that are thirsting for
revenge, ami using every exertion
to destroy us ? A white mechanic
is by far the most intelligent, and
is iu the "long run " the cheapest,
besides if they should cost a few
dollars more, you get it back in
keeping this class in the. country,
who will help you reduce taxes
and protect your homes and proper
ty against negro domination and
confiscation.
Employ white men in jp very place
that you can and do a good service
for your country %nd your race.
B eechkr— T ilton .—The North -
ern and Western papers come to ns
filled with* the disgusting details'
of this fafnous scandal and tell us'
of the efforts, which are clearly ap J
parent, of Beeeher's Committee 1
chosen by himself, to whitewash j
him. i
There can be, from the letters
and documents published, which
are not denied ami are but weakly j
explained, no doubt that the great
Mogul of Puritanism is guilty ol
having, under the guise of religon,'
and with all the specious reasoning!
of a giant intellect, deliberately se- :
dneed a Christian woman, a mem-'
her of his own church, from the al -
legiance she owed to her husband
alone, aud made her what the:
1 I
world will believe to be, a vile aud
worthless outcast from association
with decent people.
We might find m this mighty
fall of the arch enemy of the South,
an occasion for much glorification
and exultation, but the promptings!
of a christian spirit teach us to be:
silent. The great Beeclier was the |
recipient of our liveliest hatred ; the
fallen Beecher has our contempt.
We will have 110 more to do with
the scandal
RAPIDES IN LEVE!

Adopted.
The Mass Meeting assembled at
the Town Hall, pursuant to a call
made—Hon. Win. L. Sun ford was

ly elected President—Gov. Tlios. O.
M.iore, and Mr. J. 8. Butler, elect
ed Vice Presidents.
E. R. Biossat, H. L. Daigre mid
Geo. Stafford were elccted Sect's.
On motion Robt. P. Hunter, Esq..
Resolved , That it is the sense of
this meeting, that the White Man's
Party, is the only party upon which
we can all unite, and liest meet
the necessities of the hour, therefore
that we adopt flint name tor the or
ganization now to be effected by us
and we will make this campaign
under that name.
Oil motion of Major Seip, it was
Resolved, That the chair appoint
a committee of five to draft Reso
lutions.
The chair then appointed the fol
lowing Committee on Resolutions:
Fred Seip, R. P. Hunter, Lewis
Texada, Robt. L. Luckett aud J.
Levin.
The following Resolutions were
presented to the Couveution by the
committee,
Whereas, The State of Louisiana has
for six years been politically 111 the
hands of a corrupt body of white adven
turers and a few ignorant but no less
venal negroes, who have ruled her des
tinies for the purpose of plunder and to
oppress by onerous taxation and nnjiist
and iniquitous legislation her honest
and tax-paying citizens, to the end that
the domination of her iusetiable op
pressors might be perpetuated; and
Whereas, After having in the last
canvass fairly elected our State and Par
ish tickets, we were deprived of the
right to have our voice iu the control of
our affair.«, by the strong arm ot the
military force of the United States Gov
ernment. and that since then we have
been compelled to submit to the State
administration of a government which
we unhesitatingly pronounce to lie a
shameless usurpation, begotten in fraud,
brought forth iu tyranny and upheld by
force ; therefore be it -
Resolved by the white people of the
Parish of Rapides in Mass Meeting as
sembled, That we recognize in the sub
sequent action of the President of the
United States in the controversies ill
the States of Texas and Arkansas, and
still more recently his refusal to furnish
troops at Viekeburg, iu the State of
Mississippi, a determination on his part
to regard and respect the rights of the
sovereign Stales to settle their interna)
disputes themselves, and the ground
for a confident hope that vt'hen we shall
have again elected men to fill the offices
to he voted for this -Fall, who are the
choice of the jienple and who reflect
their sentiments and are the represen
tatives of their interests, that he will
notagal.n interfere in this State to defeat
the will of the people.
Resolved, That it is a fact about
which there can be no difference of
opinion, that the struggle iu the State
of Louisiana to-day is one of compe
tence against presuuiptons ignorance:
honesty against the most unblushing
corruption and the most barefaced ras
cality; aud of justice and right against
profligate injustice and wrong most foul
and disgra eful. That upon one side
are arrayed the honest masses of th *
people, without distinction of color, who
earnestly desire a just and honest gov
ernment of the State, which will pro
tect the rights of all and promote its in
ternal prospertiy, and upon the other
the corrupt and debased office holders
and office seekers, with their ignorant
followers, who desire power hut to
abuse it aud seek office only (or its
spoils.
Resolveö, That we have seen and do
now view with concern the purposes of
the negroes united in a solid body upon
the basis of race alone, and that we de
plore their efforts to Africanize the
State of Lonisian I, and that self-pro
tection, as well as a regard for the wel
fare of our families, the security of our
property and our own pride of race,
forces upon us the necessity ot opposing
to this solid union of the negroes into
one compact political body, a like union
of our own racein the coining campaign.
Resolved, That while we propose to
unite the wiiite masses, we do not in
tend to wage any war, either of force or
intiniidatiou, upoif the negro, nor do we
either intend or desire to deprive him
of aiiv one ol the rights secured to him
by the Constitution and Laws, but on
the contrary, we seek to secure for our
Stute a government Under which the
two races can live in peace and harmo
ny, and which shall dispense its bless
ings alike to all ; which shall not op
press either and shall be strong enough
in the confidence of the support of the
people, to suppress lawlessness, punish
crime and restore Louisiana to respect
abroad, that capital and immigration!
may seek here a secure home, to «level-1
ope our natural resources and prolit by j
onr natural advantages. ;
Resolved, That the necessity for our i
success in ttie coming campaign is s«»
great ami the issue at stake being n«»i
less than the weal or woe of Louisiana j
for years t«> come, is so momentous, that
every true son of the State must do his
utmost to secure the success of the peo
ple's movement, and no division In our
ranks or litkewiym support must be
tolerated for a moment. Having now
inaugurated the canvfltes in this Parish,
Rapides expects every one to do his du
ty—nobly, with unwavering determi
nation and with invincible enthusiasm.
Resolved, That the decision of Jus
tice Bradley In the case of the Grant
Parish prisoners commends him to us
as an able jurist, an upright Judge and
fearless man. That we hail it as the
end ot a series of persecutions without
" ' ' ■ •
parallel, and as a «heck to the arrest
and arbitrary imprisonment of oar citi
zen« for imaginary offences: and that
thanks are due Messrs. Marr, Whlttaker,
Ellis and Ryan, the Counsel who volun
tec red in the trial of the Grant Parish
prisoners, for their noble defence of
those unfortunate gentleman.
Resolved , That we regard the recent
promulgation of the Infamous Registre«
tion Law, by W. P. Kellogg, the Usur
per, as an ontrage upon onr rights, and
as an attempt on his part to deprive the
honest people of the State of an oppor
tunity to register and vota, while ft-ft
doubtless Intended by him to afford ft
basis for carrying the coming election
by fraud. We warn the Registrar of
this Parish that any attempt to regulate
or control tlie registration in this Par
ish so as not to afford a full and fair Op
portunity for all to register, and any
«liscrinntlon against the white cltltens
of this Parish, will not be tolerated for
one moment, and will be resisted by
—'''Peaceably If we can, Fokciblt If
we must." Tllat we are in no humor to
rrifl«* with any attempt, either direct or
indirect, to defraud us of any of our
rights.
Resolved , That tlie Chairman of the
Meet in ir appoint delegates; to reprvseut
the Parish of Rapides In the State Con
vention to assemble in tlie city of Baton
Rouge on tlie Fourth Monday of the,
present month. That we endorse tho
joint call of the Democratic Central
Committee and the Committee of Sev
enty for that Convention, and that we
look to It to adopt such a policy aa will
unite the white p»ople of tills State, and
that we pledge to its nominees our cor
dial support and to the Convention Itself
our hearty co-operation.
Resolved , That this Is a people's
movement, independent of all past par
ty affiliations and regardless of all past
party names and organizations. That
as the people we pledge ourselves to
unanimity of purpose aud to unswerv
ing activity and determination. That
iu this crisis it is ot paramount Impor
tance that private considerations should
He sacrificed to the public good, it Is
therefore onr determination to support
for office none but good and tried men«
The office must. seek the man, and we
counsel the Parish Convention to as
semble, to put forward the best men of
the Parish for the respective Parish
offices to be filled by election this Fall.
Resolved , That tlie present contest
is one of the people, and not of party,
for the redemption of the State of Lou
isiana.
Resolved , That the Chairman of this
Convention ap|Kiint a Parish Executif*
Committee to consist, of 9 members.
Resolved , That tliia Mass tyeeting ap.
