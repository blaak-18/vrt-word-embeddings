Summary of Tbents as They Happen
Trouble at Henderson.
Henderson, Ky., Dec. 13.—a note
of warning against the further re
ceipt of tobacco was found tacked on
the door of the Imperial Tobacco
Factory today, and some windows
were broken out of one of the Galla
her, Ltd., houses John H. Hodge,
a Regie buyer, received a warning
letter and has placed heavily armed
guards at his houses in Henderson,
Madisonville and Slaughtersville.
The Dibrell-Glover factory, inde
pendent, also has engaged guards.
Mayor Harris has sworn in all the
men asked for by the tobacco men.
Growers of the stemming district
have been strong in their denuncia
tion of lawlessness, And it is believed
that all threats come from boys or
meddlers. This is considered espe
cially probable since the Imperial
Company has just bought the 1907
association crop. —Nashville Banner.
336 Booming Guns Salute Roosevelt
When Fleet Sails.
Norfolk, Va., Dec. 12. —There will
be more gun powder burned next
Monday in Hampton R-oads than there
was in the historic battle between the
Monitor and the Merrimac. Every
one of Admiral Evans’ sixten ba£ k '
tieships will fire twenty-one guns on
the arrival of the president o> his
yacht, the Mayflower, and they will
repeat the salute when they pass that
vessel on the way out to sea. The
admiral, his division commanders and
ship captains, are busy today work
ing out the details of the program
for the president’s reception and the
departure of the fleet on its long
voyage.
The Mayflower is scheduled to leave
Washington at 5 o’clock Sunday af
ternoon, reaching Fort Monroe short
ly after 8 o’clock Monday morning.
With the president will be Secre
tary Metcalf, Assistant Secretary
Newberry, and Rear Admiral Brown
son, chief of the bureau of naviga
tion.
The firing will be led by the Con
necticut, the guns being let loose sim
ultaneously from the ships of each di
vision—four ships at a time.
Admiral Evans, accompanied by his
staif, will then come aboard to pay his
respects to the president and receive
his final instructions.
The final order for the start will be
flashed by direction of the president
from the Mayflower to the Connecti
cut.
Next will begin a series of signals
from the Connecticut under the per
sonal direction of Captain Royal G.
Ingersol, chief of staff, which will
bring about the actual movement of
all the vessels. As each ship passes
the Mayflower, about 200 feet from
the vessel, the presidential salute of
twenty-one guns will again be fired.—*

What Candidates Say of Roosevelt’s
Stand.
Speaker Cannon: “The president
speaks for himself. It would be use
less and inappropriate for me to at
tempt to interpret the president’«
words. ’ 9
Senator Foraker: “That has been
his position all the while, I suppose,
but I don’t care to discuss the mat
ter, thank you.”
Senatoy Knox: “I am not at all
surprised. I believed him the first
time. The president’s word is always
good with me.”
Secretary Cortelyou: “I can not
discuss the subject.”
Alabama Beyond Threescore Mark.
The State of Alabama has just
passed the eighty-eighth year. The
State has passed through a most
eventful year. Much work has been
accomplished.
No Reduction in Stove Rates.
The Southern Association of Stove
Manufacturers, .which control all the
stove manufacturing business of the
entire South, held a meeting in Bir
mingham this week. It was decided
that, notwithstanding the decrease in
the price of iron throughout the coun
try, the association will keep the
prices of their product as at present.
The following resolution was adopted:
“Resolved, That after a careful re
view of the entire situation and con
ditions, the manufacturers can not
find wherein the prices for the com
ing year can be modified.”
They declared that the past year,
with iron prices at the maximum, they
operated at a loss and will only break
even under present conditions by ad
hering to present prices.
No Third Term for Teddy.
President Roosevelt will not be a
candidate for third term.
President Roosevelt has at last
spoken as to the “third term.” He
is emphatic in his determination not
to accept another nomination. He
quotes the announcement made two
nights after his election, in which he
said: “Under no circumstances will
I be a candidate for or accept another
nomination,” and follows this with
the announcement:
“I have not changed and shall not
change the decision thus announced.’*
Hughes to Get Support of President?
Washington, D. C., Dec. 14.—-
Washington hasn’t enjoyed such a po
litical sensation since the president is
sued his reiterated declaration that
he would not be a candidate again, as
that which it experienced this after
noon when it became known that
State Senator Alfred R. Page, the
close personal and political friend of
Governor Hughes, of New York, had
spent nearly an hour with the Presi
dent.
It was natural that the interview
should be looked upon as an effort to
bring about a better state of feeling
between the president and the gover
nor. It is known that Mr. Roosevelt
has not been well disposed toward
Governor; Hughes as a presidential
candidate.
It is believed that the conference
of this afternoon means that the two
luminaries will be drawn closer to
gether.
It is not impossible that Governor
Snifara will yet be adaiaidratieM
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
candidate for the presidency, should
the Taft boom collapse, as is predict
ed in certain quarters. At least a
state of feeling may be brought about
that will render the president chari
table towards the aspirations of the
Empire State governor.
Senator Page declared that a great
deal of the talk about antagonism be
tween the two men had been brought
about by indiscreet friends. He said
it would entirely disappear. He ad
mitted that Governor Hughes would
be pressed for the nomination, and
said that he had not the slightest
doubt that New York would send a
solid Hughes delegation to the nation
al convention.
• Secretary Taft will have part of
the Ohio delegation probably, Senator
Foraker will have the rest. —Atlanta

Laborers Want Crusade on Railroads
Stopped.
In an address issued by the execu
tive board of the Georgia Federation
of Labor a plea for more conserva
tive action on the part of state and
national officers in their dealings with
railroads is made, while more strin
gent immigration laws, the passage of
the Beveridge anti-child labor bill and
the establishment of the parcels post
are recommended.
The greater part of the address is
devoted to the discussion of anti-rail
road legislation. It is claimed that
“the rampant agitation against rail
roads in the past few years has
caused greater losses to the people
of American than all the strikes of
the last hundred years, and all that
are likely to occur in the next cen
tury.”
Waiting Game Played by Congress.
The statesmen on Capitol Hill are
playing. The lower house has hardly
been in session three hours, all told,
since the speaker’s gavel fell at noon,
December 2. Some old bills have been
introduced, which various represen
tatives have been pushing for several
years. The currency question is the
one uppermost in the minds of con
gressmen, and an avalanche of bills
dealing with the problem generally
and specifically have been introduced.
HIGH TIDE OF PROSPERITY FOR
GEORGIA.
It is a weakness of human kind to
think, say, and believe that things
are not quite as good in our day and
time as they were in the old days.
Hence the belief which many of an
other day and generation have that
the South is not today as wealthy as
the section was in ante-bellum days,
when the wealth of the Southern
planter was proverbial, and there was
by reason of that fact established the
reputation of the Southerner for un
bounded hospitality and plenty.
Commenting on this phase of hu
manity, Captain R. E. Park, state
treasurer, and one of the best in
formed men (in the state in regard
to the resources and wealth of Geor
gia, said:
“Never in the history of our great
state has it been so wealthy as it is
today. Some of our older people are
fond of saying and believing that
Georgia and the South were wealthier
and times better before the Civil War
than at the present time, but the
statement is not borne ou by cold
facts.
$300,000,000 Wiped Out.
“I have had occasion to look up
the figures bearing on this matter,
and I find that the high tide of pros
perity in former days in Georgia was
reached in 1861, when the taxable
property of the state amounted to
$671,000,000. Os this sum, more than
$300,000,000, nearly one-half of the
whole, represented slaves, and this
immense wealth was wiped out of
existence by a stroke of the pen when
President Abraham Lincoln signed
his emancipation declaring the negro
slaves of the South freedom.
“When one thinks of it, the strides
which Georgia has made in material
progress since that day are really
wonderful. Confederate soldiers re
turned to their devastated and ruined
homes after the surrender at Appo
mattox, footsore, weary and half
starved to take up the fight against
poverty. As bravely as they fought
under Lee, Jackson, and other famous
generals—and the history of the world
furnishes no example of so Titanic a
struggle—the battle which they waged
against poverty and oppression was.
even more valiantly fought. Under
the horrors of reconstruction, the
burdens which carpet-bag govern-,
ment and negro misrule imposed on
a struggling and impoverished peo
ple, they never lost heart, but strug
gled along, finally coming into their
own.
Property All Replaced.
“The result of that struggle is
truly magnificent when we look at
the wealth of Georgia today. The
$300,000,00 of slave wealth wiped
out by the Civil War has been re
placed by property holdings valued
this year at $699,000,000 —an increase
in value of taxable property of $28,-
000,000 over Georgia’s most prosper
ous slave-holding days! Is there any
race but the Anglo-Saxon capable of
accomplishing as much, or any peo
ple who could have done more than
our Georgians?”
Captain Park might have added
that the valuation of property for
1907, stated at $699,000,000, is based
on returns for taxation. The real
value of the property, as it would be
returned were the proper machinery
provided for equitably assessing val
ues, would be fully one-third more. —

A CHANGE IN THE MATTER OF
COMMISSIONS.
We have decided to make a uni
form rule, giving 30 per cent com
mission on new subscriptions, and 20
per cent on renewals. We hope that
every agent will get busy and co-op
erate earnestly. If you can’t do any
better, send along the remittance in
those nasty little clearing house cer
tificate*.
