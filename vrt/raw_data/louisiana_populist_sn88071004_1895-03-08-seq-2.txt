A Gray Elorse of Another Color.
When our D]emocratic party
went into power an'd took the boun
ty of 2 cents per pound off sugar
of the merchant-plauters of South
Louisiana, ahnd replaced said boun
ty with a taritt which does said
merchant-planters no good, but
pours a cool $40,000,000 into the
lap ot Havemyer and his sugar
trust, and makes we consumers of
sugar sweat more than the said
bounty did-when this rather un
expected step towards "tariff re
form" bad been stepped, the said
merchant-planters sent up a wail
to Congress that shook the walls
of Jericho.
These wails avalling naught, the
said merchant-planters appealed to
their business friends-men with
whom they traded, and perhaps
owed bills, and these men straight
way ordered their Congressmen to
vote for said bounty.
And it came to pass that the
said bounty passed, and the said
merchant-planters can now pass,
and their creditors will always
pass.
But our said Democratic Con
gress repealed a law which they
had not passed, and they did not
wait for the regular session to re
peal said law.
And this law which they repeal
ed cut off our money supply which
was already much too scarce. And
this contraction of the money made
prices lower and dollars much
harder for farmers-producers all
over the country, to get.
So a planter-not a merchant
planter, nor even a sugar-planter
but a real farmer, living not far
from, this town, after selling his
cotton and finding that it did not
pay the expenses of making it, and
said farmer knowing that said con
traction of the currency, brought
about by said Democratic Congress
had wrongfully chiselled hinm out
of the value of his cotton-or la
bor-4aid farmer appealed to said
Democratic Congress for help-for
that which bad been taken from
him and millions of his fellows in
the cotton and wheat fields all over
the country.
This appeal availing naught,
said farmer awaited developments.
About January 1st, his commission
merchant sent said farmer a dun
for present and past obligations.
Then said farmer wrote said com
mission merchant a long letter ex
plaining the situation and showing
how his inability to meet his debts
was due entirely to the actions of
said Democratic Congress, and
said farmer urged said merchant to
help him to urge Congress for relief
and to wait for his bills until said
relief could be had by getting in a
real, genuine Democratic Congress.
But, said commission mdehant,
unlike those merchant tlaeds of
the sugar planter-merhdmt, Jsat
wrote back to msaid farmer that his
explanation was entirely Masstia
factory, and that anlem the money
was forthcoming the * weold

The Silver Party.
At last the silver men in both
the old parties have taken the sage
advice given them by Tom Watson
of Georgia when he -said over a
year ago, "If you are in favor of
free silver why don't you get into
a free silver party," and organiz d
a new party to be known as the
S'iver or Bimetallic party.
But for fear of extending the
same benefits and advantages asked
for silver to some other interests,
these silver men have attempted
to ignore that young giant, the
People's party, which has done all
the heroic pioneer work for silver,
opened the eyes of the people on
the question, and which is as loyal
to silver as any party it is possible
to create.
This is a very natural step to be
taken by those silveiites who are
just now breaking away from the
old parties. Men do not usually
do things instantaneously. They
want to feel their .way cautiously.
Finding that the organizations and
leaders of both thq old parties are
bought and paid for by the gold
bugs, and that there is absolutely
no chance to restore silver in eith
er or both of them, the silver men
take the first step by getting out of
these old fossils.
But for fear .of antagonising
some power that they hope to
bring to the support ot their issue,
they refuse to join the Populists
the legitimate fathers of the free
silver issue, and undert-ake the
huge task of building a new party.
The platform as outlined in a
clipping from the Picayune, pub
lished elsewhere in this issue, is
splendid as far as it goes, and cov
ers, we believe, pretty thoroughly
the question of money, butt does
not differ in any essential point, or
even detail from the Populist plat
form's money plank, therefore we
tail to see why this new party
should draw into it a single popu
list. It proposes to socialize mon
ey-let the people through their
government own and control the
amount of money to be circulated,
instead of allowing private indi
viduals and corporations do so.
But the People's party proposes to
do exactly this and more; it pro
poses to do the very same thing
for the two other ,great public ne
cessities, land and transportation.
The latter two factors in the
production of wealth have been as
much abused by private ownership
as has money, and no permanent
prosperity can be secured for this
country without a settlement of all
three of these great questions. We
might have the circulating medium
increased to 50 or 100 dollars per
capita and leave the present chan
nels of absorption open and in two
or three years at most it would all
be in the hands of a few individuals
sad corporations, or enough of it
to enable them to dictate the price
af all products just as they do now.
It hams taken the life time work
tof many men like Nortoum Weaver,
Harper, Vinoemt and Batema, and
ten years work from a thousand
others as devoted, and a well de.
med issue advocated fully by no
other political party in existence,
to ereie the People's party, and
there is engaged inJts isupport to
day over .two million men, two
thoulsand newspapers and the log
ic of events,t and this new party
can gather from history the enor
mity of the task before it.
We believe, however that the
ecoiod step taken by these free
silver lkeole will Ibe where they
belong, into the People's party.

The American Bimetaulic League
Ieues an Address
Calling on the People to Form
a White Metal Party
And Sweep the Country in the
Next Presldeatial Electiolt.
Washington, March 5.-The fol
lowing was to-day issued by the
American Bimetallic League:
A statement of the issues on
which the new party will organize :
Tie money question is now in
disputably the dominant issue in
the United States, and will remain
so until settled and settled rightly.
Other questions, however impor
tant, must wait for this, which, to
a greater or less extent, Involves
all others. The issue is between
the gold standard bonds and bank
currency on the one side, and the
bimetallic standard, no bonds and
goverment currency on the other.
i. On this issue we declare our
selves to be unalterably oplposed to
the single gold stajndard, and de
mand the immediate return to the
constitutional standard of gold and
silver, by the restoration I,y this
government, imlependently of any
foreign i)ower, and unrestricted
coinage of tboth gohl :nd silver
into staundlatrl money at the ratio of
16 to 1, anld uponl terms of ex:u'-t
equality ; the silver cointage to be
a full legal tender, equal with gold,
for all debts and dues, public ;and
private.
2. We hold that thlie power to
control and regulate a paper cur
rency is inseparable troln the pow
er to coin uoney; and hence that
all currency intended to circulate
as money should be issued, and it"
Volume controlled, by the general
government only, and should be
legal tender.:
3. We are unalterably opposed
to the issue by the United States
of interest-bearing bonds in time
of peace, and demand the, pay
ment of all coin obligations of the
United States, as provided by ex
isting laws, in either gold or silver
coin, at the option of the govern
ment, and not at the option of the
creditor.
On this issue we appeal from the
dictation of the money power to
the intelligence and patriotism of
the American people.-Daily Pica
yune.
The address issued by the Bi
metallists will be published next
week. Watch for it, as it will be
very interesting.
This is one of the biggest events
of the year.

us a pleasant call yesterday and
kindly remembered the printer.

Editor LovIsu N PooUIsT :
Let me call youear attention to in
consisteneies In Mr. Groh's critl
clem of "ilve" In yesterdayu's
Times-Demonrat.
He says, "gold is so very valua
ble because it costs so much labor
to mine amd melt it." Here you
will observe that Mr. Groh meas
ures the value of gold by labor,
when, to bat a few liues peoseding,
Je a saMid, "msey is the meas
we of commercial valae." Without
noticing the faet thastMr. Grob is
here gailty of the Iaeamissteney,
froem the gld point of vcew, ef
setti# ap two stnasadus e alae,
we will pas on to the mxi whl h
is a real IaeoLsistenCy fem a legi
eat polat of view.
In the Oat lastsase Mr. Geb
has told u that mey is the mere
ur ofvala, in the next he tells
s tLhat labor irst mesre the val
Se tl material of which be
makes his meLas of vdlae.
Ithas beusa pamme to e wby
lsbor shuld measure the vala of
gold and then stop just there, and
Inot measure the value of all of its
other products; and not only this,
but that gold, the product of Io
tior, itself measured by labor,
should, after lbeilg created by Iin
bor, turn upon and rob labor of
this power to measure the value' of
all commodities ; and not yet con
tent, nundertakes to measure the
value of its creator, labor.
There always appeared to, ue an
inconsistency int this; and I have
never been able to get the idea
that money is a measure of value,
at all, to stick in my mind. And
I have endeavored in a recent ar
ticle published in the Comrade to
give a definition of a measure ot
value that strikes me as being more
nearly correct than any thing I
have yet seen in print.
I here give it, "The measure of
value of money itself, and of all
other things, is the time and labor
and skill required to produce the
(money or) thing, taken together
with the quantity of product and
demand for it in use.
Now, after you shall have ascer
tained the value of any given
thing by this rule you may express
this value in figures representing
dollars and cents and a medium of
exchange may represent this value,
but not measure it.
The rule measures, the figures
express, and the money represents
the value of the thing; and the
value of the money, the represen
tative of value, would, itself, have
been measured by this rule.
Mr. Groh is mistaken in saying
that gold is so very valuable be.
cause so much labor is required to
mine and smelt it. It requires
some labor to do this; but that
alone does not fix the value-there
is the time, the quantity of pro
duct and demand for it in use all
to be taken into the calculation in
ascertaining its value ; and of mon
ey, the medium of exchange which
would represent value so ascer
tained, McCulloch says, "it is pos
sible, by sufficiently limiting its
quantity to raise its value in ex
change to any conceivable extent."
Judge Tiffany says the only
necessary to assure a value to mon
ey made of leather, and not re
deemable in precious metals, is to
properly regulate its quality aml
guard against counterfeiting. The
demand for it in use will then
regulate its value.
Then, it this be true, and it is,
to what extent may gold not ap
preciate as population and produc
tion increase T I will not say as
trade increases, because the in
crease of trade will not be an item
to consider on even a relatively
diminishing money supply, can you
fix the limit ?
Mr. Groh argues against the res
toration of silver, that it would
again disturb values. The bene
Its to accrue to the great debtor
class, now so oppressed, are not
then worth considernng; the rob
ber is to be allowed to walk off
with his booty, and invited to re
peat his depredations at will, by a
guarantee of perfect immunity
from all responsibility for his acts;
and this, beouse to demand res
toration would disturb the equi
nsmity of the robber.
This is the sum of the gold
basis arguments as nearly in a nut
shell asMr. Groh and I can put
them. Mr. Groh, with his great
name, D. Webster Grob, no doubt
aspires to statesmanship. It is to
be hoped he may some day achieve
it. But not by arguments in favor
ofat the destnruction of values of
property and of labor, and the
cramping and choking out of all
enterprise ia this young and giow
ing nation of ours.
Respectfully, &c.
