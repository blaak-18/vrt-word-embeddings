exactly what to do yet, until he
could see a copy of the
new election law which he suppos

Pop in the crowd pulled a copy of
the law out of his pocket and hand
ed it to-the astonished lawyer and
told him the Populist office had a
thousand copies for a week. Blut
then the Pops are always ahead up

Late ill the llevening of \Vteinies

(laughter of Mr. .James Walker,
white, was sent by her mother to
return some meal to a nfeighbior.
She was overtaken at a lonelr
place on the roa 1 by one Richard
IIolnes, a young n :,ro, and most
cruelly aszsanilte . Upon being re
laased by the tifnl the child hasten
ed to give the alarm. The whole
couunity tirn ad out to r t he
Sillain down, th search was con
tinued until Frihday morning, % hen
he was found on the Loskett Plan
tation on Red river, near East
Point, when after a desperate at
tempt to escape he w.-V arrested
and brought back to tde place
where he had commnittLd the out
rage when he confessed the crime.
He was taken in charge by about
one hundred and fifty indigtnant
citizens who dealt out swift justice
by hanging him to a limb of a tree.
So you see Mr. Editor ward 2

Fusion On Electors Only, Is
Maidness.
Says The IIon. Thos. E. Watson.
Being desirous of giving these
who differ with us as to fusion ev
ery possible showing we wrote the
Hon. Thomas E. Watson, our nom
inee for Vice President, and whose
shrewdness, courage and patriot
ism none will deny, asking his ad
vice on fusion in this State, giving
him as much of the situation as
could be embodied in a reasonable
letter.
His reply is characteristic of the
man. So full and clear that noth
ing can be added, and yet so short
and decisive that it fairly rings as
it closes. Read it Populists, and
then reflect before you fall back in
to the arms of the dear old Demo.
cratic promisers.
Thompson, Ga., 8,-21, 1896.
iH. L. Brian Esq.
My Dear Sir:-The pol
icy of dividing electors with Dem
ocrats and getting the minority ev
ery time is simply ruining me and
the party. It is folly. It is mad
ness. It leaves me out of the race
before It begins.
I advise that you run a straight
Populist electoral ticket for Bryan
and Watson.
No Populist can consistently vote
for a single Sewall elector.
Yours Truly,
Taos. E. WAtsreon.

A. Oth!ers Sec L'.
There is a split in the Populist
ranks in this )tate, Every other
party has been cut in two, and the
Pops, though a little late, want
somi of the fun. Shackelford, of
Grant, and Crawford, of Winn,
are leading a nimovement in behalf
of a conmbination with the Foster
ites on an electoral ticket. They
live in parishes where a s~iuare
deal was had in April. and they
have never felt the col steel of
the ballot-hox thief between the
ifth iand sixth ribs--Insider in
Daily Item.
We hardly think the gentlemen
above named are in favor of a
split, as they both quietly acquies
ced in the action of the convention
and stated before the action was
had that they would abide by the
result.
Neither do we believe them to
be in favor of a combination with
the "Fosterites." Almost the
entire party in this State are in fa
vor of a joint electoral ballot be
tweoen the Populists and silver
Democrats, whenever the latter
will concede the former the Vice
President.
The only dlifference between
Messrs. Shackelford and Crawford
and the great bulk of the party, is
that the former are a little hasty
and seem to think pacific measures
will win the greatest concession
from the Democrats; while equally
as good Populists believe that as
long as the Democrats of this
State can win without th3 Popu
ist vote no concessonn will be
made, but when they need uis they
will finally, with much reluctance
concede us our rights.
In other words Messrs. Craw
ford and Shackelford are running
after the Democrats for a trade on
almost any terms, and the bulk of
our party believe that we conceded
every thing save our organization
at St. Louis. and that reasonable
Democrats will not ask us to do
more.
'1he Times-Democrat has the
following to say of the same move
ment:
"Mr. Shackelford, of Grant, led
the fight for fusion, and declared
that the people of his parish want
ed to see silver win, and would
rather vote for bewail than have
Bryan defeated. Mr. Crawford of
Winn, the strongest Populist par
ish in the State, made the same
declaration, and twenty-three oth
eridelegates pronounced for fu
sion,"

Again, in its issue of Aug. 31st
it says in effect that nearly all Pop
ulists save those who wa:nt office
will vote the Bryan anut Sewall
ticket.
This 'is the highest con -option
a Democrat can have of political
action.
Great Democratic papers and
leaders honestly thlieve that Pop
ulist leade hrs are like them-out for
office or "sttt'."
Acting on this belief t'ity stnt a
secret messenger--a U. S. Senator
-to Tom, E. Watson, the great
Populist leader and hero of the
South, and offered him a Cabinet
office to c( me down off the Popu

he hasn't the slightest chance of

They never heard of a Democrat,
since Jackson's famous declaration,
"To the victor tlongs tbc spoils,"
that could stand for a brief second
on principle when an ,s,00() oflice
was in sight.
Excepting a few broad hints at
Baton Rouge, they have not settled
down to business in the office-offer
io3 line in this State yet, and we
very much fear that Messrs. Shack
elford and Crawford, both of whom
already have good fat offices, will
rush into their camp bodily before
the re:t of us can get in shape,
"because of the offices."
This must be what the T.-D. re

Many well informne, l people he
lieve that a silver dollar is t(Ilayn

is the onily reacscn why it is wrth
100 cents. wheln the >.ilker in it
is worth much 1t-s.

The S eletaryv of Ihi Tr:l.iir;
say, "'Being stan l:dal Imc.s of thI
United States th'y e:re not ri., iedi
able in :ny other form of nmo,.'y."
So we have over .,w l milicinls (o
silver dollars in use today, mlost
of therm represented iby silver cer
tificates for convenience, and while
the silver in each one may not he
worth over 55 or I; cents, the dol
lar passes readily, e:gerly, Irdeslipr'
ately, easy, everywhere for 1'll
cents, and there isn't :any gold be
hind them either.
Law, the fiat of the ,overnment
makes it, and so if we, hadul t he free
coinage of silver, or thel sa:uie if
the stamp was on patper for that
matter.
Then let us have more loney,
and if it doesn't "pass" so darnet
easily, it will suit the great masses
of the people better.
If Populist leaders allow the
I )emocratic party to gobble t hem,
the rank and tile inl this State ani
most of the South will go to the
Republican party Iecause of D)em

party. So the country would le di
