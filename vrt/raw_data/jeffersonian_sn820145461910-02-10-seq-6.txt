IF THERE WERE MORE OF THIS!
Dear Sir: —I herewith enclose you
check for two dollars ($2) for Wat
son’s and The Jeffersonian for as
long as you can send them for that
amount. I have access to both your
magazines at the home of two of
my friends with whom I read, hut I
am not satisfied, I want my name on
your list; then, too, I want the
magazines in our offices, where the
boys can rub up against your sound
business ideas, for I find that you do
me good in a business way, to say
nothing of the many lessons you
teach politically, socially and mor
ally.
Your essay some months ago on
the Rebel has furnished me more
food for thought than anything I
have read from your pen. The
meaning you gave to W. E. Henley’s
“Invictus” has given me many hap
py moments. I know I can better
appreciate the great poem, the
which, if one can comprehend, I am
sure he is capable of soul expansion.
I am sending you a list of my
friends. My business being scatter
ed explains the many places from
whence they come. I am sending the
list on our old friend Hubbbard’s
paper. I know he will forgive, for I
am making him a list of the ones
that are not already subscribers to
his publications. I hope this list will
do you some good. If your people
can get the same good from it as
Hubbard has in the past you will be
able to reap several good subscribers.
I have helped you. I want to
help you. I will help you.
Yours truly,
D. A. QUARLES.
P. S. —I sent Miss Emma Perry
a check for $5.00 today on your say.
D. A. Q.
(You could not have made better
use of that $5.00. T. E. W.)
Dear Sir: —Please state in The
Jeffersonian if the Government is
back of all the national paper cur
rency that is in circulation?
Do the national banks issue a cer
tain amount of currency on their own
account?
Please give us the law and the
real facts. SUBSCRIBER.
Rome, Georgia.
Answer.
Every dollar of the National bank
currency is secured by United States
bonds.
The total is $681,872,400. In
brief, the law allows the national
banks to deposit United States bonds
with the Federal Government, which
thereupon issues to the banks notes
to circulate as money, to an amount
equal to the face value of the bonds.
The banks draw interest on the
bonds, all the time that they remain
on deposit.
The advantages to the banks are:
(1) Interest twice on the same
money,
(2) Exemption from taxation on
the bonds' and a very slight tax on
the money—one-half of one-per cent.,
semi-annually paid.
(3) Power to expend and con
tract the currency, thus controlling
prices.
(4) Virtual partnership with the
United States Government, and the
free use of the people’s money in
their private business.
(5) Exploitation of public credit
for private gain.
(6) The enormous power insep
arable from the delegation to them
selves of the sovereign function of
creating money.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
ANENT EXPRESS CO. METHODS.
Dear Sir: —In the “Bookkeeper”
for January 10th I came across an
article that appeals to me, and
should do so to every philanthropist
in the Union. It is an article in re
gard to a college, or high school, in
the mountains of Tennessee at Cum
berland Gap. It is called the “Lin
coln Memorial University,” and while
it has a high-sounding name, I sup
pose the work is all O. K., furnishing
the means whereby the boys and
girls of the mountains can obtain an
education.
My object in writing you is to call
attention to the school and to in
quire if the same is worthy of our
encouragement and support. Here is
an opportunity for the people to help
our own boys and girls to get an edu
cation instead of sending their money
off to Africa and China. As you are
pretty well up on all these things
kindly let us know something about
this school in the mountains, and if
worthy of our encouragement I, for
one, will do all I can to help them
out.
Fred. H. Wilson, secretary, 1170
Broadway, New York, is name signed
to the article asking for aid.
' Yours truly,
JOHN Z. MORRISON.
Campbell, Fla.
Answer.
We have no information concern
ing the school mentioned. There is
no better location for such an institu
tion, however. You might write to
Col. Jno. B. Brownlow, of Knoxville,
Tenn. If he does not know, he will
find out.
The Emma Perry School, Dublin,
Ga., R. 4, is a most worthy under
taking. It is struggling into exist
ence under many difficulties. The
plucky little woman deserves univer
sal and hearty support. T. E. W.
HOW TO SIMPLIFY MONEY ISSUE.
Dear Sir: —I have been a sub
scriber of all your papers and maga
zines from The People’s Party Paper
to the present time. I also have the
three volumes of your “Story of
France,” which I wish every human
being in the world could read.
Now, without taking up too much
of your time and space, please answer
the following questions on the money
situation:
We all know that under our pres
ent national banking system, with
the whole volume of our currency in
the hands of the national banks, they
can force a panic on the United
. States any day in the year they
please. They can loan when they
please, and refuse when they please.
Now, here is the question,—when we
abolish the national banks, as you
think ought to be done, and as I
think ought to be done, and issue
the money direct to the people, with
out interest, I can see how part of
the money could get into circulation
by paying off all the Government em
ployees—such as the standing army
and navy, postmasters, rural mail
carriers, Congressmen, and so on,
if all this didn’t get money enough
into circulation, in what other way
could it be issued directly to the peo
ple?
Very truly yours,
S. J. SMITH.
Jackson, Ga.
Answer.
The Government could build rail
roads and canals, or could lend
money on land, to farmers and
others, as it actually is doing in the
Philippines, and as the British Gov
ernment practically does in Ireland.
Suppose our Government had is
sued greenbacks, instead of bonds, to
pay the expenses of digging the Pana
ma canal! T. E. W.

THE ATLANTA MERCHANTS AND
THE NEGRO PAPER.
Dear Sir: —Don’t you think the At
lanta merchants ought to be made to
quit patronizing a negro paper which
every week pours such poisonous
tommyrot in the minds of the black
race as the enclosed editorial? This
paper is full of advertisements given
by white men. They perhaps never
see the paper and are, therefore,
ignorant of what kind of a thing they
are patronizing.
Such statements can do no good
whatever, that I see, except breed
strife and sow the seeds of discord.
They show the stupendous ingrati
tude and amazing gall of that negro
editor.
I call your attention to this matter
for what you think it is worth.
Through your columns you could
perhaps reach the merchants, and
stop much of this rot which this ne
gro is giving to his race each week.
I wish the negro race well. It is not
prejudice that caused me to take is
sue with the enclosed article, but it
is the welfare of the negro’s own
race which I seek in asking that such
diatribes against the white man be
hushed .
Yours truly,
READER.
Comment: I agree with you. If
such men as George Muse would read
B. J. Davis’ editorial, they would
quit advertising with such a South
hating, social-equality negro.

A LETTER AND A COMMENT.
Dear Mr. Watson:—When you wrote
up Socialism you quoted from the
leaders. If Populism was written up
you would be quoted. In politics I
am your friend, and have been
through the trying years. In reli
gion, I am a John Wesley Methodist.
Now, I come to ask you a favor. In
the last issue of your weekly you
write on the subject of Holiness. I
ask you to be as fair to us as to the
Socialists. I, therefore, refer you to
Wesley’s Plain Account of Christian
Perfection, and to his sermon on Sin
in Believers. I think you can get
these from any Methodist preacher.
I also refer you to the following liv
ing leaders: Rev. G. W. Mathews, Sa
vannah, Ga.; Rev. E. M. Bounds,
Sandersville, Ga.; Rev. C. C. Cory,
Atlanta, Ga. Those out of the State
I wish you to investigate are Rev. H.
C. Morrison, Louisville, Ky., and Rev.
Joseph Smith, Meridian, Miss. Any,
or all, of these will give you a state
ment of what they teach. Rev. Mr.
Chadwick will lead the meeting at
Indian Springs next summer. You
might take a day off and see what he
teaches. I think you will find that
none of them teach that they can’t
sin. None claim to be saints in the
sense you refer, I don’t think. lam
sure you are not the one who will
Missionaries Wanted
To Take Up Collections For
Watson’s Magazine
and The Jeffersonian
YOU WILL GET A RAKE-OFF
Write for particulars to THE JEFFS, Thomson, Ga.
misquote a people; you have had
some of that to contend with your
self. Especially on Foreign Missions.
Now, as to this sinning business, I
beg to give you my individual opin
ion. Ido not believe that any Chris
tian sins. It seems to me that you
had as well call a thief an honest
man as to call a man who voluntarily
breaks God’s law a Christian. No
act can be a sin, as I see it, unless it
is done willingly and knowing that it
is a sin. You lawyers wouldn’t let a
man hang who killed by accident.
You lay great stress on the intent.
I leave the Holiness part for the
leaders, if you will look into it. Be
lieving as I do, I have very little faith
in the Christianity of the average
professor of religion. Yes, the
churches discourage Holiness just as
they do almost everything that is any
account, except the collections. If I
am not mistaken, they have discour
aged you in your effort to relieve the
masses from oppression. This is too
long. I feel sure that you will state
our case fairly, and then shell us
for not living up to it as much as you
please. Read what Wesley says a
Methodist is, and then you will have
our ideal.
Very truly your old friend,
R. T. ABERNETHEY.
Forsyth, Ga.
I forgot to tell you that I think the
man who would fill another with
shot, or invade his home, would
thereby add another star to his
crbwn. It would be no sin.
My friend, Abernathy, must bear
in mind that my comments on Holi
ness were confined to the letter and
the statements therein made.
But would there be no sin, in
shooting the fleeing adulterer? I
think there would be. Not only
would such a killing be manslaughter
under our law, but it would be a
violation of the Ten Commandments.
“Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord.”

DOMESTIC HEATHEN IGNORED
FOR FOREIGN HEATHEN NEEDS.
Dear Sir: —Your answer to the
gentlemen who challenged you to a
debate with Mr. Ellis in Atlanta, on
the subject of Foreign Missions, was
manly and courageous—you did ex
actly right, and all must see that the
position taken in your reply is un
assailable. I hope you will never let
up on the subject till reason and
Biblical methods take the place of
enthusiasm and folly.
Do the readers of The Jeffersonian
know that for years the Methodists
and Baptists have been sending “for
eign missionaries” to the Protestant
countries of Europe? The Methodists,
especially, are acting in this direction.
It is a fact that they have Foreign
Missions in Scandinavia and Germany
