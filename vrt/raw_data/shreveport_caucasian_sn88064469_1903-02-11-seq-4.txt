Off Bermuda Island.
Hamilton, Bermuda, Feb. 11.-The
Quebec Steamship company's steamer
Madiana, Captain Frazer. which sail
ed from New York Saturday last for a
special cruise among the Carribhean is

The steamer Madiana was built in

Midiana has on board about 100 pas
sengers. The list is made up princi

and cities of Connecticut and New
Hampshire. The Madiana is lying
with a hevy list and broadside to the
wind on the reef one and a half miles
northeast of North Rock. Seas are
breaking over her. The tug Gladisfen
r only succeeded in getting within a mile
of the Madiana. Efforts are being
made to transfer the latter's passen
gers to the Gladisfen by means of a
life boat. A heavy sea is running.
Is a Total Loss.
New York, Feb 11.-A. E. Outer
bridge & Co., local agents of the Que
bec Steamship company, received cable
advices from Hamilton confirming the
Associated Press reports of the wreck
a of the Mediana. According to their
advices the ship is a total loss, but no
mention is made of any loss of life.
AFTER THEM.
Two Thousand T.oops Gone to Meet the
Revolutionists.
Caracas, Feb. 11.-A force of 2000
men with fifty horses and two guns,
under the command of Minister of War
General Ferrera, left Caracas in the
direction of the seaport of Higueroto,
fifty-five miles east of Caracas. The
object of the expedition is to attack
a body of 1500 revolutionists under
p General Monagas, who is reported to
be too feeble to attack the government,
but strong enough to devastate a dis
trict around Rio Chico, province of
Miranda, sixty miles southeast of Car.
acas, and daily enter and pillage the
T town.
Even ardent revolutionists seem to
t recognise that President Castro is mas.
ter of the situation.

WATERS KIDNAPED.
Man Charged With Embezzling Eight
Thousand Dollars Captured.
Victoria, B. C., Feb. 11.-Unable to
extradite Alexander W. Waters, alias
W. A. Wilson. , is wanted at Ma
nila on a chat , "f embezzling $8000,
and who was arrested at Montreal some
days ago, United States Special Agents
D. R. O'Brien 'tnd C. N. Herron kid
naped him on board the Oriental liner
Athenian, which sailed from here yes
terday morning.
Waters, it is alleged, decamped with
$8000 and went to Hongkong, and later
came to Victoria on the Athenian. De
tectives missed him here, but traced
him to Montreal, where he was ar•
rested. The United States and Cana
da have no extradition treaty with the
Philippines, and in order to avoid le
gal proceedings Waters was quietly
taken to Washington, and hence via
Chicago and St. Paul to Seattle, where
he was placed in jail for a night and
brought to Victoria Monday. He was
told that - he would be able to
catch the San Francisco-bound steam
er Senator here and go to San Francis
co. Instead of the Senator, he found
the steamer he arrived here on from
the orient at the dock, ready to sail.
Prevailing gales caused postponement
of the steamer's sailing. Waters was
kept in close confinement and then put
on board.
SEDITION CHARGED.
Committee Has Been Appointed to In.
vestigate the Matter.
Seattle, Wash., Feb. 11.-John W.
Trame, editor of the Daily Record
Miner of Juneau, is confronted with a
charge of sedition. In a controversy
growing out of the attempt of Judge '
M. C. Brown to put a stop to gam
bling, the Record-Miner has freely
criticised the judge. Judge Brown has
appointed a committee of leading mem
bers of the bar to investigate the ut- I
terances of the editor and present their
findings to the court. The paper says
that when the judge leaves the bench
to mount the pulpit and lecture people
as to what they should do, it has a I
right to criticise him.
JOURNALIST GONE.

Louisville Courlat-Jourual.
Oskaloosa, Kan., Feb. 11.-A. L. Pat- I
rick, one of the editors of the Louis

CARITAS TRANSITORIUM.
And thou, my child would ask of me
If thou in giving oft a part
Of love to many passing souls
Hast drained the fountain of thy
heart ?
Ah, many things the old man knows.
And hidden secrets wait his call
Many things not worth the while
But this he knoweth best of all:
God filled thy heart with purest love
From His gf'eat plenteous store:
And lest the measure were not fair
Each day He adds a little mire.
You can not keep it all, this love,
So with a free hand give
The overflowing of thy heart
That some lonely heart may live.
Better we give to unworthy soul
Than to some soulless thing
That drinks the best we have to give
And pays us with its sting.
Love man, and love will come to you
To shield you from life's wind
For when we give or love to man
They pay us back in kind.
Loe is like the marble white
Under the sculptor's hand;
It feels the chisel's cruel point
And the grinding wheel of sand.
Ever the marble's greater part
The sculptor cuts away
The chips are treasured still, I thin,
By men who passed that day.
He scatters all about his way
The chips like wasted sheaves;
He cuts away the useless stone
The perfect form he leaves.
Give thy love to a human heart.
This would I tell to thee
For if you give youar love to man,
Their love will come to thee.
