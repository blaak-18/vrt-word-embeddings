A PSALM OF LIFE.
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.
I . i ' I I I
Life is real! Life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul.
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and
brave,
Still, like mufflled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.
In the world’s broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of Life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a hero in the strife!
Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time:
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o’er Life’s solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.
Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.
—Longfellow.
LOWER PASSENGER RATES.
(From the Atlanta Journal.)
It was only natural that the general
demand for a reduction in the passen
ger rate on railroads, which has been
going up from all over the country,
and which has been placed of late on
the statute books of half a dozen dif
ferent states, should find an echo in
the state of Georgia, where the justice
of such a reduction is as great and
as evident as it is in any of the other
states which have taken up this mat
ter.
It has been known, moreover, for
some time that the Farmers’ Union,
which is one of the strongest organiza
tions of actual tillers of the soil in the
whole country, has had it in mind to
present this matter to the railroad
commission of the state and ask that
the passenger rate be reduced.
The petition, signed by President
Charles S. Barrett, of the national
organization, by President Duckworth,
of the state organization, and other
officers of the Georgia division, has
now been formally presented to the
state railroad commission, which, it
is announced, will hold a hearing some
time during the present month, at
which not only the petitioners but
representatives of all the railroads are
invited to be present.
We believe that this is a step in the
right direction, and we have taken oc
casion to say so on a number of oc
casions. The Farmers’ Union is ever
alert to the best Interests of its mem
bers and of the people at large, and
perhaps nothing which has engaged its
attention has met with more cordial
endorsement.
Always bearing in mind that the one
overshadowing question of railway re
form in this part of the country is the
reduction of freight rates, and that
nothing should be allowed to divert
public attention from that issue, the
present undertaking cannot be too
heartily commended. Cheaper passen
ger fares is a movement in the right
direction which has been sweeping the
country from one end to the other dur
ing the past few months, and as a re
sult of these concerted and persist
ent efforts, the desired reform has been
secured.
There is absolutely no good reason
why Georgia should be behind in this
matter. If it is shown that a reduc
tion to two cents would work an act
ual injury and injustice to the rail
roads —which we do not believe —then
let the reduction be made to two and
a half or two and a quarter cents.
The Democratic party of the state
is on record, as expressed at the
Macon convention, in favor of the re
duction in passenger rates. There is
no good reason w r hy the traveling men,
at least, should not have the benefit
of interchangeable mileage books, at
the rate of S2O per thousand miles. •
We are glad to know that the matter
has been given a definite impetus and
that cheaper passenger fares are in
sight.
FARMERS AND THE MILLS.
(From the Columbia State.)
There is another noteworthy fact in
connection with our cotton mills. The
wages paid in 1905 by the mills of the
Carolinas and Georgia aggregated $20,-
500,000 —or an average of $205 per op
erative, big and little. And the cot
ton growers in the vicinity of the man
ufacturing centers have profited in the
increased price given by the mills for
the raw material, and hundreds of
markets for farm produce have been
created. Os course the annual con
sumption of more than two million
bales of cotton by southern mills has
tremendously strengthened the posi
tion of southern cotton growers, and
has advanced the price of the raw
material to the consumer everywhere.
So the factories, directly and indirect
ly, have had a most important part
in the remarkable prosperity of the
south, and it is almost as much to the
cotton grower’s interest that the fac
tories should have labor as it is for
him to have workers on his farm. The
immigration movement is one in which
every profession and industry in the
south should actively participate.
WHY NOT BE FREE FARMERS?
(From the Washington Post.)
We are educating our young men
for idle gentlemen, trying to make
lawyers, teachers, doctors and clerks
out of material that is needed for
blacksmiths, carpenters, merchants
and other honest “hewers of wood and
drawers of water.” It is a mistake,
and a big one, to teach boys and girls
to believe that labor is disgraceful
and to do nothing for a living is
more becoming to society. There are

“walking gentleman” in the great dra

the final curtain is rung down on the
sad act in which they have been edu

FARMERS AND UNION LABOR.
(From Donham’s Doings.)
The country editors who have labor
ed more or less to make farmers be
lieve that they have nothing in com
mon with organized labor, should read
the resolutions passed by a Farmers’
Union meeting in Texas the other day,
and they will readily see that the
farmers have at last awakened to the
fact that their interests are identical
with those of the mechanics and labor
ers of the cities. The Farmers’ Union
now has a membership of 750,000 and
is increasing at a most wonderful rate,
but the country editors have apparent
ly heard nothing about it. But they
will hear of it by and by. The farmers
have played the pack-mule for the rest
of mankind just about as long as they
propose to do so. They are preparing
to do their own marketing of all farm
produce. At the meeting in Texas
the other day, 416 delegates were in
attendance, representing territory hav
ing a membership of 214,000. Resolu
tions were passed in praise of organiz
ed labor, recommending the eight-hour
work day, and indorsing the union
label. Hurrah for the farmers! The
time is near at hand when every man
who earns his bread by honest toil
will be- solidly combined against the
idle drones, who will be compelled to
seek new vocations or go to bed with
kinks in their intestines.
n
Result of Root’s Speech?
(From the N. Y. Tribune.)
Secretary Root’s speech which start
ed the discussion of the limits of fed
eral and state authority was made in
December; since then governors have
written messages and legislatures have
discussed laws showing that the states
are becoming as keenly alive to the
new industrial problems as is the na
tional government itself. Mr. Root’s
proposition was that if states did not
asume new duties which lay upon the
borderland between state and national
authority the nation must. Nobody
can complain of the lack of eagerness
of some of the states to attack these
new questions, and if others are slow
it may confidently be expected that
public opinion within their borders
will not allow them to lag long be
hind their more progressive neigh
bors.
Judge Fowler to the Old Confeds.
(From the Confederate Veteran.)
And when old Gabriel blows his horn,
You old Confeds
Will face in line on that great morn—
You old Confeds.
The Master then will say to you:
“Just take your seat in that front pew;
There’s nothing here too good for
you—
You old Confeds.”
