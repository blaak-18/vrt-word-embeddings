;,(e ,,',.,)\'e Ie'li:ilerationill of the prin
'cills of hie Onil:ha lp1atform on
the llntliey qIuestiOli. Mr, WVash
ti urn leaves out the principle of
governmelnt loanls direct to the
pei RIle at 2 pi r cent a year. But
he says: "Ainother planik might
l'e adlteil ca:ing for a law regulat

If 1 lr. \V'slihuitrni will intei veiu

. ,. a t; .i it ..tl,rte il- cii'..'-
alliiug liniey loanelrs. The illtoley
i,,,iiu.i alw.,?'; ive 't, isid alwvays
exlp(t to be aible to dodge or lprlt
vent the en!forcement of the most
striniLeit usury laws.
Vliein Mr, Washburn advocates
a usury law and expects it to reduce
the rates of interest, lie at once
becomes the laughing-stock oe the
bankers, who is spite of usury law s
take froum 1. to 5 per cent a month,
according to the neccessities of
their victims.
Should the Populist party drol,
out of it's platform the idea of
government loans direct to the
pecople at 2 per cent a year and
.dopt Mr. Washburn's idea of a
usnry law, it would receive the
derisive sneers of the money power
ar d the contempt of those who
borrow, and- the bankers of the
west, at least, would-laugh in their
sleeves, at the party far enough
behind the times to advocate a usury
law for the purpose of reducing the
rates of interest.
' he money loaners claim? that
competition will sufficiently regul
I ate interest rates. The railroadu
corporations say all that is needed
to reduoe treiL:t rates to a prope'r
level is competition. In short, the
corporations that are now enslaving
the Ieoplc, all ,unite in reccommend
ing competition as the great pan
acea for all the oppression that is
now a menace to the liberties of the
people. At the same time the com
bined corporations see to it that
competition does not exist. They
s:,e to it that all laws regulating in
terest, freight charges, etc., remain
a dead letter. The people are rap
idly coming to the conclusion that
the only way to regulate the rates
of interest and settle the currency
questton in their interests, is gov
ernment I atns direct to Qbe people,
ai cot p.:ice or 2 per cent a year.
The people fully realize that the
only iay to settle the railroad
question, is to have the govern
ment own the roads and operate
them, as it now operates our postal
systema. Government competition
in losninmg money would reduce in
terest to 2 per cent a year without
the help of usury laws, and would
moon give the business wotld a cash
system. Government competition
n operating the railroads would
redluce freight, express and passien
per rates to cost price, without the
assistance of that expensive corlo.
aton ornament knownas the inter
state commerce commibon. Gov
ernment oqmnetition is the only
power, except that of divinity, that
can eeletatilly and for all time
prevent the banking railroads and
otha corportips from enslaving
the people. The present leaders
tothe Populist party must march
along the line laid down a tin
Omaln platform, and secure to the
people the benefits of government
ean ptitlm or step down and out,.
puld dthogparty falter or qoibb~e
in Itoe.orts to free the peopl from
dhe slavery of corporatio rule,
some other prt more paitriotic
wokld iown take its place.
