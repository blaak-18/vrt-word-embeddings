The Atlanta Recorder's Court
(Concluded from Page 15)
I am enclosing herewith for your
information a copy of the original
petition for habeas corpus filed in
the Loeb case, together with copy of
my bill of exceptions and memoranda
from which I prepared my brief I
am sorry I have not a copy of the
brief, as perfected, to mail to you,
but I think that the data enclosed
will be sufficient for all purposes. It
may be of interest to you to know
that when this case was argued be
fore Hon. H. M. Reed, Judge of the
City Court, he announced that if his
was “a court of last resort,” he
would discharge the applicant; that
he had no question on his mind as to
the unconstitutionality of the sen
tence. The case under the law was
taken to the Court of Appeals, where
Mr. Mayson, representing the city,
and myself argued the same. A
month or six weeks after the argu
ment, the judges sent for us and
stated that they thought that inas
much as constitutional questions
were involved, that it was their duty
to certify them to the Supreme Court
for final adjudication. Mr. Mayson
thereupon insisted that they decide
the questions, whereupon Justice
Powell announced that if the matter
were up to them for decision they
would hold that the Recorder was
without power to send a man to in
voluntary servitude. Mr. Mayson
thereupon insisted that the matter be
certified to the Supreme Court. I in
terposed no objection to this. The
case was certified, set down for hear
ing, heard at length and a decision
is expected in the not distant future.
If I can give you any further infor
mation, kindly let me know’.
Yours very truly,
T. B. FELDER.

Additional Letters From the People
OLLIE S. WOOD LOST.
My Dear Sir: —As a lifelong
friend of yours, and a subscriber of
both of the Jeffersonians, I come
asking a favor of you. I am sending
you a paper, Jacksonville Times-
Union, or the disappearance of my
son, Ollie S. Wood, from Stevens Pot
tery, Ga., October 21, 1909. I send
you the engraving; the Atlanta Con
st? Mion and Journal has done mp
the f-vor of publishing the same, and
ask you to do the same if possible.
The notice of his description is
not complete as it stands; w’ould add
this to it:
Always smiling. When talking
looks you straight in the face. Show’s
upper teeth plain. Good musician;
Ollie S. Wood.
plays piano, organ, violin and guitar.
Had at least SSO with him when
he left his sister at Chattahoochee,
Fla. We think he met with foul
play between Chattahoochee and
Marion. Want, to ask all readers of
the Jeffersonian to look for him,
and, if found, wwite me at Stevens’
Pottery, Ga. I send postage for re
turn of photo.
Respectfully
R. L. WOOD.
Stevens Pottery, Ga.
INTEREST ON JEFFERSONIAN
BONDS TURNED BACK TO US
IN SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Dear Sir: —I am returning the
check for interest on my Jeffersonian
bonds, w’hich you sent me a few days
ago, and for it I want you to send
both Jeffersonians to the names and
addresses I will give you. Send me
one copy of “Bethany.”
It may be that some of these peo
ple are already subscribers, but I
hardly think they are. Let the sub
scriptions to the Magazine begin with
the December number. lam sending
it as a Christmas present to these
amateur friends. They will be
thoughtful, appreciative readers. The
subscriptions to the weekly are all
to men who ought to be regular sub
scribers, and I hope they will be at
the end of the three months. Let
their subscriptions begin at once.
Bethany I am buying to keep on a
misionary journey among my
friends and acquaintances. I order
ed a copy of Bethany as soon as it
was published. 1 read it tw’ice, and
since then it has been on the go
most oi the time. It is about worn
out now. I have nearly all of Mr.
Watson’s books, and hope to order
t’-e others soon.
I expect, if nothing happens, to
rse the interest on my Jeffersonian
bonds every year in some w r ay to aid
the cause of Populism—so much do
I believe in Mr. Watson and his Jef
fersonian Democracy.
Yours very respectfully,
SALLIE T. PARRISH.
