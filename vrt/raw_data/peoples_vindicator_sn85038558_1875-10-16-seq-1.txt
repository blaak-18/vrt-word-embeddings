The order of the dayv:nowbefore

this: "Have the Radical Republican
Sparty and its Grant. uddinistration,
with their Immense majorities in near
ly all the State Legislatures, with
nearly all the Governors for years
go? done their duty fairly by the people 1"
This is the order of the day. This is
OvO, the' supreme question before which
all others sink in insignificance. This
truly has been the order of the day
for mnoie than a year past; and many
States have already spoken, and oth
ers will soon speak. In the amidst, of
add this vital popular legislation, we
a hear a piping voice of nearly defunct
ºar Kadiealism--"I call for the debate on
a'u gold, and paper currency. I more
line the indefinite postponement of that
Sother subject--te life of the nation."
e it o,' no, Mr. Radical, side shows can

ity shall have ascertained whether they
have or have not any government) of
ra their own, we will have ample time
to count the gold and paper, and put

the Radical Repablican managers
