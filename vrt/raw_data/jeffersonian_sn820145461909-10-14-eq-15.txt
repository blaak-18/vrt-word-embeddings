To the Land of Enchant
ment
(Concluded from Page 3)
Phillip St. Clare, a man whom every
body in Oldfield loves, for his kind
ness of heart is universal. He is
everybody’s friend.”
The old familiar name fell sweet
ly on Laura’s ear. “Yes, now she
was sure that she had seen the man
whose written words of love had
stirred her heart so long ago. After
all he was still alive, and had never
sent her the message. Should she
| hope?” she pondered. “Yes, she
I would hope and trust to the fairies.”
I “Is the gentleman married?” was
R her next question to her companion.
The woman shook her head. “No,”
she said meditatively, “he is not mar
ried. The story of his life is like a
story out of a book. You see, we
Southern people know quite all
l about one another’s affairs”; and she
| laughed pleasantly. “We are not as
I conservative as you Northerners, but
1 are rather more like children of one
f family. Everybody in Oldfield knows
I the story of Phillip St. Clare’s life.
J a very young man he married,
\ and lived happily with his wife for
I ten years; then she died. Two years
plater he married a beautiful girl of
jthis place. But she did not live long
f after their marriage. She died quite
suddenly of heart failure. His sor
row was keen, but who can blame
such a splendid man for again fall
ing in love, since everybody loved
him? But the third lady of his choice
ilted him. We never knew why she
.id so; I do not think St. Clare him
elf knows. However, he has been
„rue to his last love-dream. For five
ears he has been faithful to some
aughty Northern lady, who will
ave none of him. Every evening,
accompanied by his dog, he walks
long the path by the river. Every
iorning he takes the same walk.
the river sings to him of his
lost love.” “Perhaps,” said Laura,
softly. The woman went indoors.
A. sudden impulse took possession of
ier guest. “I, too, will walk beside
he river,” she thought, and at once
started down the street.
“May all the good fairies attend
e!” About a mile from the city
ie met him, as he was returning.
,Vhen face to face he looked at her,
and as he looked she stretched forth
her hands and softly said, “Kismet.
Is this fate?” “Then fate is kind,”
he answered, and took the extended
hands. “You are Laura, my fairy
princess. I have your picture in my
heart. How? why?” he began, but
she stopped his questions by a ges
ture. “Because I was insanely jeal
ous,” she said, simply. “Jealous at
not being your first love.” “And
now,” he said sadly, “I seem too old
for you; I am forty-five.” “And I
am twenty-nine,” she said; “just old
enough to know that forty-five does
not seem very ancient.” He took her
to his heart, there by the crooning
river, and she told him about her
sudden wild desire to visit his land
of enchantment. “It was your love
that drew me here,” she said. “I
shall always believe that its magic
influence called me to your side.
“And I shall always bless the won
derful influence that bade you come
to me, whether born of the fairies or
of my intense love,” he said.
A few weeks later they were mar-
ried. All Oldfield knew the particu
lars of the affair, and rejoiced with
them. Laura wrote to Mrs. Melvin
Reed: “Oh, Nannie, please come to
me. I have taken up a permanent
residence here, in the land of en
chantment. The fairy folks have
given me a new name. So when you
arrive, be sure to ask for Mrs. Phil
lip St. Clare. Please bring as many
of our friends with you as will
come.” Mrs. Reed first laughed,
then cried over that letter. Then
she hastened to explain matters to
her friends, and shortly afterward
quite a goodly number of Northern
ers started gaily away to the land of
enchantment.
The winter oat crop should be
seeded this month. Early seeding is
essential to success. Late seed oats
are almost invariably injured badly
by the frost. They have not time to
get tillered over the ground suffi
ciently to keep the frost from heav
ing out the plants. A great mistake
made by most farmers is that they
will persist in seeding oats on the
poorest land on the farm. Whilst
it is true that oats will make a
crop of some kind on poorer land
than almost any other crop, except it
may be rye, it is doing the crop a
great injustice to subject it to this
treatment. If the crop is too full of
great possibilities to be so treated,
if put on good land and liberally
helped a yield of from fifty to seven
ty-five bushels to the acre can be
safely counted upon, and this yield
will pay better than an average
wheat crop, and, besides this, the oats
|nd the straw are worth more for use
on the farm than a w’heat crop.—

COWS THAT PAY.
We hear a great deal said about
cows that don’t pay. Their keep
comes to more than their products.
Well, it is all true. You don’t want
such cows. Still, we can’t all own
the heaviest milkers and the biggest
butter-makers. Nor do we need to.
Neither are they always the cows that
return the most profit. A cow that
produces less often costs less for in
vestment and her keep, and hence re
turns as much or more clear profit.
This is a fact, though not an argu
ment against fine cows. They are
all right in their place.
There are many points to watch
in the dairy business. The man
with the finest cows and the biggest
barns does not always come out
ahead. It is the man who makes ends
meet in the best way. You need not
despair because you don’t have pre
mium cows and a big plant.—Texas

FIFTEEN-CENT COTTON.
They are talking about fifteen-cent
cotton on the floor of the Savannah
Cotton Exchange. Predictions are
3effersonian
freely made there that before Decem
ber fifteen cents a pound will be paid
for the staple. A farmer who will
spend an hour or more talking to the
cotton men of Savannah will go
home convinced that he is going to
get enough for his crop this year to
pay off all the back debts and reduce
■ize of the mortgage on the farm.
Those who are looking for extra
high prices for the staple are basing
their assertions upon the crop re
ports and the great demand for ac
tual cotton that is already being felt.
The government’s cotton report of
June 15th showed a general average
of but 74.6. This was very poor.
The usual average condition is about
86.
With the government forecasting
a poor cotton crop, with heavy rain
throughout the cotton belt at a criti
cal time and with the stock from
last year’s crop considerably reduced
as compared to former years, there
seems nothing for the price to do
but advance. If it does not advance
there is going to be much disappoint
ment from the planter straight
through to the exporter. If the South
can get fifteen cents a pound for cot
ton this season it will help some to
meet the high prices for necessities
which the government tariff barons
