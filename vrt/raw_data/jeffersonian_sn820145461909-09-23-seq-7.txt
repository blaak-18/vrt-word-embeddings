would either apply for a change of
name or quit the Foreign Mission
work and never write another article
commending it.
You are right, Mr. Watson, d»wn
right, everlastingly, living right. I
wish you had all those article in
book form and a copy in the hands of
every Christian and professed (or
whitewashed) Christian in America.
You have opened the eyes of many
sluggish minds and put them to
thinking. Miss Houston is, no doubt,
perfectly honest, but she is so miser
ably ignorant.
Keep on, Mr. Watson, you have
thousands of good men who are with
you for reform from the individual
to and including the nation.
Your friend,

NEED A NEW PARTY.
Dear Sir: —I mail you a copy of
the Citizen, our labor paper here, in
which you will find a good speech on
the Jap question in California.
A friend of mine, Mr. Chas. F. Ba
ker of Pasadena, who has written a
book on finance, “Law or Metal,”
informed me he sent you a copy. I
hope you received it, and will haVe
time to read and give your opinion of
it.
I see you are starting a Jefferson
ian club in Thomson; that may be a
good thing for Georgia and the
South. I read various opinions and
ideas on a new party, a conference,
etc. What we want and need is a
new party under a new name, entire
ly free from all existing parties. To
be called an Independent Party. If
there could be enough of the leading
reformers gotton together who would
agree to work together according
to the will of the majority for just
what the majority wanted, to discuss
any and all questions on labor, eco
nomics and political issues, and when
there shall be enough independent
clubs in good working order, then
call a convention from all the states,
organize a new Independent party
for 1912, would be the thing to do.
I don’t believe we can get the people
together under any old name. It will
have to be under a new name and a
few well defined principles upon
which all can agree; be short and
plain so everybody can understand.
We can’t win unless we can draw
liberal-minded men from the old par
ties, men who think for themselves,
men who are willing to come with us.
I think the words Independent Party,
would be the best inducement to
them to join a new movement. But
it matters not so much about the
name as it does the principles and
unity of action. However, I do not
see any hope for the future. Monop
opoly is now in the saddle, the big
gest and strongest the world has ever
known. As I see it, this republic is
doomed unless a majority of the com
mon people, the producers of this
land, can be united for independ
ent and political action in 1912.
Yours, etc.,

FOREIGN MISSIONS.
Dear Sir: —Some late issues of
The Jeffersonian and also of the
Watson Magazine, have fallen into
my hands, and I have been reading,
musing, thinking, comparing notes,
measuring arms, bringing verdicts
and passing sentences.
We were much amused at the tac
tics of war brought to the front by
those zealots of foreign missionary
proclivities. It would seem, howev
er, that after the public had weighed
the evidence from facts and figures,
that your would-be tutors, dictators
or reconstructors would wish by this
time that some friend would tell
them “where they are at”. We
think, possibly, that those letter
writers have decided that it did not
pay to attempt the fatal project of
“bearding the lion in his den”.
We think also, that those return
ed missionaries are quite conscien
tious in their endeavors to forever
silence the tongue that speaks or
stop the hand that writes for the
Jeffersonian on these pet themes.
Nevertheless, there are thousands
who are being informed along these
lines through this medium, for which
we are thankful. Yes, we are glad
there is a T. E. Watson, a people’s
paper and a monthly magazine, all
of which stand for moral and civic
reform at home and abroad.
Respectfully,
H. STACY.
Boston, Ga.
ONLY MONEY DEEP.
Dear Sir: —Please find herewith
ten cents. Send me September num
ber Jeffersonian Magazine.
I greatly admire the patriotic
views you have taken concerning
Foreign Missions and trust you will
ne’er desist until our entire domain
is enlightened as to the evils the
present system of Foreign Missions
are cultivating among our people.
From my earliest youth, my sen
timents upon this question have been
in accord with yours. I never have
and never will give a cent for this
much exaggerated cause, and frank
ly say those who do, do it either
through ignorance or for self-gain,
and are only buying fuel for bonfires
in their own homes.
It is clearly shown by undisputa
ble authority that Foreign Mission
influences are only money deep, and
the height of the subjects’ ambitions
is to appear “like as we are”, and
to eventually usurp our position in
the world “the cream of God’s crea
tion.”
They are ever striving for supre
macy and are now demanding equal
rights in white schools and the priv
ilege of marrying white girls. What
a pity the millions of dollars that
have been erroneously spent upon
them was not spent in excluding
them from our once more peaceful
shores.
At the present progress they are
making, we could look down, if pos
sible, in a hundred years from now
and behold our descendants with
trailing ques caressing a pipe of
opium, or partaking of rats on the
half shell.
Hoping your efforts will be crown
ed with a golden success, I am
Very sincerely,
E. L. McKEE.

AS IMMOVABLE AS THE PILLARS
OF HEAVEN.
My Dear Sir: —I am reading with
deep interest your September Jef
fersonian especially your reply to
Miss Janet Jay Houston on the ques-
Jeffersonian
tion of Missions, and in defense of
Home Missions. Now, Mr. Watson,
the work which I have followed for
years enables me to testify to the
truthfulness of your position. I
have the concrete evidence of the
suffering here at home, and I am
preparing an article, which it is my
purpose to send you to publish in
your journal, which will be an inspi
ration to the patriotic, a revelation
to hundreds, and consternation to
those religious zealots and blinded
bigots who are engaged in the task
of draining our country of funds for
the Heathen Chinee, the unspeakable
Turk and the man-eating savages of
the South Seas, while here in this
“Land of the Free and Home of the
Brave” our own flesh and blood are
perishing at our doors; not only for
material subsistence, for the “Bread
of Life.”
I most heartily commend and en
dorse your fearless and patriotic po
sition, and I want to say that you
have a cause that is like the glare of
the noon-day sun, and the cause has
an advocate in yourself that will re
move any apparent spots from its
lustre.
This seems to be the age of relig
ious bigotry, and the decline of gen
uine Christianity.
1 have been engaged in the Home
Mission work for years, and I am not
speaking by hearsay, but by what has
come under actual observation. In
this article which I am preparing,
and which it is my purpose to send
you within the next two or three
days, it is my purpose to further ex
pose the fallacy of Miss Houston’s
position, that the destruction of For
eign Missions, will strike at the root
of Home Missions; it is not true. I
have solicited aid from men who
were “clothed in purple and fine
linen and fared sumptuously every
day”—and who set up of nights
thinking of the naked cannibals on
the banks of the Congo, and who
loosen their purse strings to send our
fanatical agents to that far away
land, and who have positively refus
ed to help hungry orphans and des
titute widows here in the State of
Alabama.
Mr. Watson, I have taken in
old Confederate soldiers —just think
of it —here in our Southland; men
who wore the gray, and who follow
ed the dauntless Forrest and the im
mortal Jackson in the smoke and
thunder of conflict for the defense
of constitutional liberty and state
sovereignty; I tell you I have taken
in these old heroes, sick, footsore,
weary, hungry and helpless; oh,
shades of our departed heroes—can
it be possible—and yet it is true,
that these conditions exist, and there
be those who are gathering up the
shekels to send to foreign lands, and
shedding crocodile tears over the
condition of nations that were thou
sands of years old when the stars
and stripes first felt the breezes of
Heaven?
Let the heathen rage and the peo
ple imagine a vain thing.
Let the fanatics assail and assault,
but the concrete facts are with you
as stable and immovable as the eter
nal pillars of the heavens, and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against
it.
I congratulate the cause of Home
Missions as having so valiant and in
vincible a defender as yourself.
With prayers for your overwhelm-
ing success in the noble field in
which you are laboring; with assur
ances of great respect and admira
tion, believe me,
Fraternally yours, r. A. ODOM,
Captain Salvation Army.
BUT, FRIEND LEE, THERE ARE SO
FEW THAT READ.
Editor Jeffersonian:—We have
said, and we believe it, that one may
take the Weekly Jeffersonian and any
three daily papers he may elect, and
if he reads the tour papers atten
tively for a year he will have gath
ered more facts and information
from the Jeffersonian than from the
other three combined. We mean the
things that pertain to one’s welfare
and that of the nation. Would that
the two Jeffs were in every house
hold in America.
We wrote Mr. J. L. Lee, president
of the Georgia State Farmers’ Union,
at its last session in Macon, to try
and get the body to pass a resolution
unanimously requesting the Georgia
Legislature, then in session, to make
the sale of any farm product before
it is matured and ready for market
a penal offense, but we have not
heard anything in reference to the
matter. We do not believe that Wall
Street methods can be practiced by
the farmers themselves without in
jury to their highest and best inter
ests —“Two wrongs never make one
right.” We are a member of the
Farmers’ Union, was a Granger and
Allianceman, and with such a school
ing you may know that we have
learned that our progress and growth
—our success—depends after all
upon our faith and practice in the
Ocala demands, lest while we save
at the spigot we may loose at the
bung. We are a great believer in
the Farmers’ Union, in its officials,
state and national, and we know they
will have the full sympathy of the
editor of the two Jeffs, as they shall
strive to achieve success in the face
of such prejudices and dense igno
rance as prevail among the masses.
Upon these two characteristics the
wily politician and money sharpers
play continually. We often wonder
how the Jeffersonians’ editor can
keep up such a magnificent fight
against such foes and maintain cour
age and equilibrium such as the
world rarely sees.
Yours truly, B. F. LEE.
Thomaston, Ga., August 12, 1909.
