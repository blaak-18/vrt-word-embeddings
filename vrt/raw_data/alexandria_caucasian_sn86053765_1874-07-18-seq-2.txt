a short tunc their lists of Premi
ums, and general Programme will

our citizens will have an opportu
nity of seeing what premiums are
offered, and of making up their
minds as to what they will enter.
Tho premium list is a liberal one,
as indeed are all the stakes, prizes
and premiums offered. Several
new features hayc been introduced

the most noticeable of which is a

Tickets of admission to tho fair «arc

numbered CoOpons entitling the
holder to one chance in the drawing
of the Grand Lottery.
Aiiotlau- feature of tho Fair will

Tho Fair will commence on the
19th of October, and continue four
days, and'as there will bo added to
tho accommodations already on the

The act ion of the Democratic Cen

not be an occasion for discord, nor
do wo propose to oppose that action

than that must bo given before we
will take tho risk of fostering enmi

defeat by divisions in our ranks.
The Caucasian has been assidu
ously advocating the organization
of the White Man's Party, and we
reiterate our belief that it.would do
more towards uniting tlio people
than any other for this campaign,
yet we would not hesitate a mo

and adhesion to any party that the
white people in this Parish may
adopt, whether it bo the White

Tho voice of tho people is the

it speaks, all opposition should

•Although tlie Democrat favocs
the scheme, out aiul ont, it-doe« not
attempt to reply to any of our fig
«res or arguments. It supports it
upon tho general principle that wo
are in '.'such a condition that wo
can't lie worsted j" and that it may
be lieiielltted. Tins Is as much
child's j) I ay awl $pphistry as the
other orgnmcnt we have heard from
sonic Of its advocates who süy :
" posterity never did anything ifor
me; posterity will have to pay the
debt, ami why should I care what
the amount is." Both of theso po
sitions is tiio veriest trifling and
are unworthy of a nic*iieut's notice.
The merchant or other business'
man who would conduct his busi
ness a Hairs with such a recklcss dis
regard pf the future, would soon
find Jiimsclf financially as bank
rupt as would thist'arish, if it goes
into this transaction in any other
spirit than a shrewd, practical aud
business like application of the
rules"which should govern commu
nities as well as inen, in their pe
enniary transactions.
We understand that there, was
to be a Communication iir the Ga
zette of this morning, upon tho sub
ject of this Rail Road. We don't
know what change tho appearance
of tho "Ancient Maiiuor" In the
editorial sanctum may have had
iipou th« fate of that communica
tion, but wo know that if it does
appear, it will deal in glittering
generalities about the prospective
benefits to be derived from the
building of the road. We are un
der no apprehensions as to a suc
cessful refutation of any of our ar
guments. u Figures do'nt lie" and
we had "figures" on them. We
challenge any advocate of the road
to controvert any single statement
of ours, with the exception of the
one as to the distance from one
limit of the parish to the' other,
which was fixed at 40 miles by us
by guess and from our own knowl
edge only, not having had access
to the Surveyors Map. But this
only related to the cost per mile
through the parish, and had noth
ing to do with the amount asked
by them, $720,000 nor with the
sixteen miles , as they themselves
fix it—from Alexandria to Le
comte. Wo will gladly open our
columns as we have done this issue,
for any communication in reply to
our figures or to any of our ar
guments against this particular
Railroad scheme. We will decline
however to entertain any or enter
upon any discussion as to the" bene
fits to bo derived from having a
Railroad. That is not the question
at issue. The question is: do we
want this railroad on the terms
offered by them 1 "fc'e arc astonish
ed at tho position of tho Democrat,
but not the least alarmed, for we
know that it can not find the sup
port of a corporal's guard in any
such position and arguments as it
uses.
Our people are too shrewd to look
upon it in that light. Before.they
declare themselves ready to give
these gentiemcn $480,000 of their
own and their children's money
when they shall have built only
sixteen miles of an already graded

Tho committee were greatly aid

in different portions , of fho State,
and on concluding their labors, ev

that no one could with justice charge
thetn, with any act calculated to
produce, dissension amongst the
people.
The Ed itor of tho Democrat, says
ho approves of the Address of the
Oottirnittec—but denounces them
for fixing upon New Orleans as the
place for the meeting of the Con
vention—find declares " they are
not going to New Orleans and will
nol send delegates there," and he
publishes a call for a Mass Meeting
of the people of Rapides on the
8th of August, to elect delegates
to some other convention, in oppo
sition of course, to tho convention
called by tho Central State Com
mittee. The Editor ot tho Demo
erat is, and will be held responsible
for having'* throvVn the first Apple
of discord in our midst—and he and
those who may have prompted him
to the courso he has taken, have as
sumed a fearful responsibility. Can
it be expected that the overwhelm

State who do endorse Ine views and
recommendation of the Central
Committee will surrender their or
ganization and their opinions at tin.
dictation of any ono Newspaper, or
half dozen politicians who can give
no better reason for their opposi
tion than the puerile "one, of the
place selected for holding the State
Convention. That question- was
freely discussed, principally by tin
delegates Iront the country Parishes
and there was not a dissentin
voice when the vote was taken as
to. the place of meeting—beoaus«:
flie committee were anxious to have
as large"an attendance as possible
of delegates, and they well knew,
tliat if any other place but New
Orleans was designated that there
would be but very few delegates
present.
The East Louisiana Parishes
the Mississippi Coast Parishes and
the Attakapas Parishes are within
a few miles run from the City by
Rail or Steamer^ and iu the present
impoverished condition of our peo
pie, but few aro able to afford the
additional expense and time, it

few delegates with pockets full of
proxies, and tlio people would not
respect their action, end the only
reason I have ever heard assigned
for the opposition to holding a
State Convention in New Orleans,
illicit is by. all odds tho most con
venient point'for the larger majori
ty of the parishes, is the charge
that improper influences aro
brought to bear upon Ute country
delegates by the city politicians—I
have often asked parties giving this
excuse for.their opposition to New
Orleans, to give me an instance
where this influonco was exerted
to t he benefit of New Orleans office
seekers. I have never as yet, had
an answer to that question. In the
last forty years, no resident of New
Orleans has been nominated foi'
Governor of this State, nor hab any
citizen of the city ever held the offi
ces of Auditor or Treasurer, and
but two have been elected Lieut
Governors and but ono Secretary
of State. I do:.'t allude) of course,

may be induced by argument and

but few will bo driven by threats,

and support the candidates nomi

Monday in Augnst. If there be
any division and dissension among
us, it will not bo because tho Con

ers for several years past; in our
State. I think I have seen eviden
ces of a determination on tho part
of the pcpple to act for themselves
in the coming canvas, and bring out

is a Democratic Executive commit
tee iu this parish, who were ap
pointed iu 1872, and it is their du^,
ty, with which they will comply in
due time, to issue a call for a Mass
meeting ot "all conservative voters
in this parish, without reference to
past political alliai tions," for the
purpose of selecting delegates to re

Address of tlie State Central
Commiitee of the Democratic
Party of Uuisiaiia.
IJooMS D kmockatic S tatu C kxtkai. )
C ommittkk, July 7,1874. I
T ij the People of Louisiana :
The Democratic State Central
Committee, in convoking a State
Convention of the Democracy at
New Orleans for fourth Monday of
August, A. 1). 1874, appeals with
confidence to all conservative vo
ters, without reference to past pol
itical affiliations to niiitein the elec
tion of delegates to this Convention.
This committee is not unmindful
that some may be reluctant to join
the ranks of a party, which, in past
contests, they have opposed. But
this party is the only national or
ganization now confronting Radi
calism and battling tor constitution
al principles—principles, in viola
tion of which this usurpation has
been foisted on Louisiana and our
people subjected to political aud ju
dicial persecution.
Recent dissensions among lonr
people and a deep and abiding de
sire to unite all tho elements op
posed to Iîadical ism, admonish ua
not to risk everything upon our
own isolated and unaided efforts j
although, in this emergency, duty
prompts us to exert ourselves as if
wo were dependent upon our sole
resources.
Issues are forced upon na which
we cannot and do not desire to
evade. But we will meet them ytitfc"
such determination and energy
that cannot fail to achieve suecem*,
We do not. contemplate inttfrfep*
liiig with the coii ititutional ami leg»
