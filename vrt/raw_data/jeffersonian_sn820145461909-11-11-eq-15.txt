yards of silk or cloth torn off and
various articles wrapped up and then
discover “no label,” anl refuse them.
That’s been done hundreds of times
and is but one of the petty acts of
hatred and tyranny.
Let no one who reads this article
understand that he or she is asked to
boycott any product whether it bears
a “union label” or not. One has a
constitutional right to examine the
article and see whether its makers
are Labor Trust contributors and
slaves or are free and independent
Americans.
I have tried to tell you something
?about those who are oppressed, villi
when opportunity of
are \ o cause tfyoy prefer
to retain their own .independent
American manhood. These men are
in the vast majority and include the
most skillful artisans in the known
world. They have wives and babes
dependent on them.
These men are frequently op
pressed and have no way to make
their wrongs known. They are
worthy of defense. That’s the reason
for the expenditure of a few thou
sands of dollars to send this message
to the American people. Remember,
I didn’t say my “excuse” for sending
it. The cause needs no “excuse.”

N. B.—Some “parlor Socialist”
who knows nothing of the Russian
Czarism of the great Labor Trust will
ask right here: “Don’t you believe
in the right of certain workmen to
‘organize?’ ” O yes, brother when
real workmen manage wisely and
peacefully, but I would challenge the
right of even a church organization
when its affairs had bees seized by
a motley crew of heartless, vicious
men who stopped industries, incited
mobs to attack citizens and destroyed
property in order to establish their
control of communities and affairs,
ahd subject every one to their orders
and exact the fees. When you see
work of this kind being done call on
or write the prosecuting officers of
your district and demand procedure
under the Sherman anti-trust law,
and prosecution for conspiracy and
restraint of trade. We have the law
but the politicians and many of our
officers even while drawing pay from
the people are afraid to enforce it in
protection of our citizens and now
the big Labor Trust is moving heaven
and earth to repeal the law so their
nefarious work may be more safely
carried on.
But You. Why don’t you strike
out and demand defense for your fel
lows?
Put your prosecuting officers to the
insist that they do their
/sworn duty, and protest to your Con
gressmen and legislators against the
repeal of the Sherman Anti-Trust
law. Its repeal is being pushed by
the Labor Trust and some big capital
trusts in order to gve each more pow
er to oppress. Do your duty and pro
test. In this great American Repub
lic every one must be jealous of the
right of individual liberty and always
and ever resent the attempts made to
gain power for personal aggrandize
ment.
Only the poor fool allows his lib
erty to be wrested from him.
Some one asks, “How about your
own workmen?”
I didn’t intend to speak of my own
affairs, but so long as the question is
almost sure to be asked I don’t mind
telling you.
The Postum workers are about a
thousand strong, men and women,
and don’t belong to labor unions.
The Labor Trust has, time without
numbers, sent “organizers” with
money to give “smokers,” etc., and
had their “orators” declaim the
“brotherhood of man” business, and
cry salty tears describing the fearful
conditions of the “slaves of capital”
and all that. But the “confidence
game” never worked, for the decent
and high-grade Postum workers re
ceive 10 per cent, over the regular
wage scale. They are the highest
paid, richest and best grade of work
ing people in the State of Michigan
and I believe in the United States.
They mostly own their own homes,
and good ones. Their wages come 52
weeks in a year and are never stopped
on the order of some paid agent of
the Labor Trust. They have savings
accounts in the banks, houses of their
own and steady work at high wages.
They like their daily occupation in
the works (come and ask them) and
are not slaves, and yet the Labor
Trust leaders have done their best to
ruin the sale of their products and
force them into idleness and poverty.
It tvould cost the w’orkingmen of
Battle Creek (our people and about
3,000 others) from $1,000.00 to
$2,000.00 a month in fees to send out
to the leaders of the Labor Trust, if
they would allow themselves to be
come “organized” and join the Trust.
Not for them, they keep the mon
ey, school the children and live
“free.” That’s some comfort for
white people.
Once in a while one of the little
books, “The Road to Wellville,” we
put in the packages of Postum, Grape-
Nuts and Post Toasties, is sent back
to us with a sticker pasted across it
saying, “Returned because it don’t
bear the union label.”
Then we join hands and sing a
hymn of praise for the discovering by
some one that our souls are not
seared with the guilt of being con
spirators to help bind the chains of
slavery upon fellow Americans by
placing added power in the hands of
the largest, most oppressive and
harmful trust the world has ever
seen.
When you seek to buy something
look for the “union label” and speak
your sentiments. That’s an opportu
nity to reach out a helping hand to
the countless men and women in all
kinds of industry who brave bricks,
stones and bullets, to maintain their
American manhood and freedom by
making the finest goods in America
and which do not bear the seal of in
dustrial slavery, the “Unios Label.”
The following article appeared in
the August, 1909, issue of the Car
rier and Patron, of Atlanta, Georgia,
the leading R. F. D. Mail Carriers’
paper in the United States:
“GALLSTONES
“While Surgeons are still advo
cating an operation as the only cure
for Gallstones, it is now pretty gen
erally recognized that such harsh
and dangerous measures are entirely
unwarranted except where the im
mediate removal is necessary to save
a life. These instances are very
rare. Os course an operation never
did effect a CURE; even where it
was successful, the Gallstones gen
erally formed again. Cutting out
3effarsonlan
the Gallstones does not keep them
from forming again any more than
cutting the hair prevents the hair
from growing. The underlying cause
still remains.
“On the other hand little progress
has ever been made where medicines
were administered simply to dissolve
the Gallstones. It is owing to a de
fect in the volume or constituency of
the secretions of the Stomach and
Liver that permits the formation of
Gallstones. When the Stomach and
Liver perform their functions fully
and normally they produce a natural
solvent that prevents the formation
of Gallstor/es. If this were not true
every one would have Gallstones.
“Recognizing this truth, and work
ing in accordance therewith, an able
Chicago physician perfected a treat
ment that combined the administra
tion of certain active and harmless
solvents together with medicines
that restore the Stomach and Liver.
Thus the solvents are immediately
reinforced and work in harmony
with the natural secretions to grad
ually and painlessly soften and dis
solve the Gallstones and restore the
secretions so that the formation of
Gallstones will be prevented without
the further use of medicine.
“This remedy is not a cure-all. It
is an honest, scientific remedy for
Gallstones, but in treating the Gall
stones and the underlying cause at
the same time, the medicines neces
sarily cure all ordinary ailments of
the Stomach and Liver at the same
time. This treatment is being dis
pensed by the Gallstone Remedy
Company, 225 Dearborn St., Chicago,
111., and the attention of our readers
is called to their ad. in this issue.
They are reliable and trustworthy.”
A REAL SOUTHERN MAGAZINE.
Dear Sir: —Some days ago, at my
request, you sent me a sample copy
of your Magazine, which I have just
finished reading this morning.
Now, in thanking you for your
promptness and kindness in response
to the request contained in my letter,
allow me to congratulate you most
heartily for the publication of a
Southern magazine which gives facts
in such an explicit manner that they
can never be questioned by any
clear-thinking, unbiased man, free
from sectional prejudice. Our Gov
ernment should be proud of you,
Dixie should be justly proud of you;
Georgia and your home-town should
forever be proud to claim you as
their own, and feel that they are
better for having done so. Your one
editorial on Secretary Dickinson’s
(that Southern traitor) Gettysburg
address is the best that I have ever
read on that subject, and it alone is
well worth the price of the -Magazine.
Inclosed I am sending you SI.OO
for which please send me Watson’s
Magazine, and oblige.
Yours very truly,
R. G. SESSIONS.
