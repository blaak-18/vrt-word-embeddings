Not the least benefit of new scientile
theories and discoveries is that they
furnish occupation for people who have
sothing to do but to take up the fad of
the hour. They can experiment on
things, or make excavations, or col
lect somethings, and, if they make no
valuable discoveries, they have at
least been out of the way of busy peo
ple wto have work to do. In this re
spect the Roentgen ray is said to be of
untold use. Everybody who has noth
ing lse to do is engaged in the ab
sorbing and harmless pursuit of phe
tographing his bones, or a penny in a
pocketbook, or something of the kind.
One of the most ardent students of the
X ray is Queen Amelie, of Portugal.
who has taken the subject up with en
thusiasm. Queen Amelie is addicted
to fads, and, as her last mania was the
study of medicine which she practiced
at the risk of their lives upon the
court, her fad for experimenting with
the Roentgen ray is regarded with
great delight by her loyal subjects. It
ls even said that it is gratitude for
having diverted his royal spouse from
the amateur practice of medicine that t
has induced King Carlos to invite
Roentgen to the court at Llsbon,where
he is to receive a high decoration for
his discoveries.

ore Special Letter.
ot r' recent years
Queen Victoria has
shown a marked
preference for the
cf South of France in
the matter of her
spring continental
an sojourns,- among
ve the reasons for t:is
of preference being
it. the fact that the
people do not ob
trude their hospitality upon her ma
jesty, who is consequently able to enjoy
'r- the natural beauties and health giving
to advantages of the place selected with
out being exposed to mobbings such as
those to which she was subjected dur
e ing one of her recent visits to a more
Ssouthern continental country.
e In 1890 her majesty passed the latter
t, end of March and the early portion of
e April at Ala-les-Baines, where she had
previously made a stay in 1885 and 1887.
y The queen was lodged in the Villa Vic
toria, a dependence of the Hotel Ber
n naseon. The rooms her majesty in
, habited were all on the first floor, the
L windows looking due south over the
SCasdne. Upon the left of the grand
Sstaircase was a boudoir, opening on to a
salon furnished in crimson satin with
Indian embroildery. The very day of
is her arrival at Aix-lees-Baines, March 25,
- 1890, her majesty went for a long drive
r- by the Gresy and Geneva road, thus
i etting a very favorable view of Aix
4 and its surroundings.
d- The following year Grasse, the cradle
IIof French civiliation, the home of
swest sounds and odors, was the queen's
selection. You can driveovr the hills
Sfrom Nie to Grasse in three hours.
t Old Grasm is above you as you ap
1 proach, Its houses scattered over the
4I mountain side, as If some giant had
a illed a colossal bag with them and then
d emptied it and allowed the houses to
le tumble out and arrange themselves as
they might without order or symmetry.
B, Beyoad, sheltering Grasse from wintry
winds, is the Mont Napoleon, where the
i conqueror came for a short rest in 1808.
l- It was at the Grand Hotel that the
r queen took up her abode in Gram, the
Ssentire h bouse, whlh eotains sixty-eight
roomsbeing retained for her. The
h botel is a handsome white building
d facing directly on the road. From a
Sbread stone balcony overlooking the
k hotel rden you see the town below,
Ssand below that again a number of tall
ehimoyes overtopping the houses of the
old town. These belong to the seven
a ty-Ifve ol and perfume pressin mills
k that have made Grasso rich.

The walls of the bedroom were covered
with "cretonne Pompadour, fond vert

- been manufactured tspecially for the

r 'happy combination of the rose, sham
I reek and thistle, with garter ribbon

a which had three windows to the west,

was arranged in crimson and cream.

In 1894 the queen paid a visit to Flor

great affection, because of the princt

it to the continent. The charms of this
romantic suburb of Nice have been
sung for a century or more, ever since
Smollett discovered what was then a
poor, miserable little fishing town of a
few narrow, tortuous streets runnig up
the side of the Chatean Hill, with plenty
of dirt and unsavory smells about the
houses, and a plethora of sunshine out
of doors.
Mounting the white, winding road
which runs up the gentle wooded slope
behind the town, you come to Cimies.
The residence, the Grand hotel, stands
400 feet or more above the glittering
waters of the Mediterranean and amid
surroundings of the profoundest his
toric interest. Long before the
Phoceans founded Nice on the seashore
Cemenelum was standing boldly on the
height above as a Ligurian oppidum.
Witnesses are abundant in the shape of
big blocks of the ancient belt, still lying
around.
The most important of the remains
of the Roman occupation is the amphl
theatre, which stands in bold, pictur
esque massiveness within a few yards of
the queen's hotel. Its solemnity and
grandeur are, however, spoiled by
an act of profanity which was voluntar
ily committed when the high road was
driven straight through the center of it.
The rows of seats, once capable of hold
ing 8,000 spectators, still stand in
among the ruins; but the arena, into
which poor slaves were once turned to
fight for their life's blood with wild
beasts, is now growing thick with grass,

while wild flowers and ferns and plants
hang loosely from the niches in the
walls which once re-echoed the excited
cries of the brutal crowds who assem
bled within them.

perched pitturesquely upon an eyriellSe
crag overlooking the broad valley of
the Paflloa. The frontage gains addi
tfonal solemnity and charm from the
shadow of the splendid grove of lex
trees-perhaps the most magnllcent
specimens extant-in which it reposes.
On the portico is a fresco, ilustrating
the dream of Pope Innocent IlL, as he
beheld St. Francis supporting the fall
ing columns of the Lateran church, and
which resulted in the request for the
foundation of the Franciscan Or(dr be
ing granted.
The queen's cboeen residence stands
upen the colline which constitutes the
first range of the triple ridged shield of
mountalns which shelters Nice from the
cold north winds. Far behind stretch

Alps, with Meat Ores and Mont ChMuve
