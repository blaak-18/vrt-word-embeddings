WEATHER BULLETIN
The Cold. the Warm and the Storm
Waves Forecasted.
(Copyrighted Igo3 by \V. T. Foster.)
Washington, D. C., March 21.-Last
bulletin gave forecasts of disturbance to
cross the continent March 21 to 25.
warm wave 20 to 24, cool wave 23 to 27.
Next disturbance will -reach the Pa
cific coast about March 25, cross west
of Rockies by close of 26, great central
valleys 27 to 29, eastern states 30.
Warm wave will cross west of the
Rockies about March 25, great central
valleys 27, eastern states 29. Cool wave
wil cross west of Rockies about March
28, great central valleys 30, eastern
states April I.
This disturbance will not bring a long
continued warm spell but the cold wave
following will be much like winter
weather.
The fall in temperature will be great
as a general average from about March
23 to 30, a little earlier west, -later east.
Clustering around March 28 will come
fierce winter storms, reaching well to
the southward, and during the last week
of March will seem to indicate a cold,
backward spring.
Next bulletin will give general fore
casts for April.
' My forecast of the great storms, heavy
rains and cold waves for about closing
days of February and first days of
March was a. very great success.
TILLMAN'S COLORED FRIEND.
The Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch
says: Senator Tillman has on his plan
tation in South Carolina a negro named
Joe Gibson, who has lived with him for
thirty years. Joe has charge of the prem
ises, carries the keys and takes care of
everything in Mr. Tillman's absence. In
speaking of this man the other day, the
senator said: "I don't know whether I
belong to Joe, or Joe belongs to me.
Anyhow, we have been together for thir
ty years, and we have agreed to live to
gether until one or both of us die, and
when I go away, if I go first, I know
he will shed as sincere a tear as any
body. I" would die to protect him from
injustice or wrong."
And this is one of the type who, with
the "Southern gentleman-old massa
and old missus" will soon be a memory.
The old-time negro, the faithful old
servant and his friend are bound by ties
which can be severed by death alone.
All honor to the old "Joes" who some
day will receive their reward in heaven.
HEWITT'S SON APPOINTED.
The Mansfield Journal says: Hon.
Phanor Breazeale has appointed Rives
Hewitt, son of Tax Assessor W. B.
Hewitt, to the vacancy from this dis
trict at the naval academy at Annapolis.
No fears are entertained by his teacher,
Prof. Crawford, of Rives' ability to
stand the examination as the young man
stands well in his classes and is ad
vanced in learning for one of his age.
Rives comes ,of fighting stock; his
grandfather was a brave Confederate
soldier and was severely wounded at
the battle of Mansfield. When the.news
of the appointment was received here
Mr. Hewitt and Rives were heartily
congratulated, as no doubt is felt that
Rives as a cadet and a naval officer
would acquit himself honorably and be
a credit to cur town and State.

THIRTEEN GUESTS.
W\EI)DING ANNIVERSARY WITH
THIRTEEN COCRSES.
!lates l)ecorated V ith Coffini-\Valk
L oder a L:ader- -IBrok he a Mirror.
Int a special to the Chici!g, Tribune is
detalcd a wedding .mniivter.arv which
was celebrated in ;alitinorec. M1d.. oni
Friday as follows:
Clinton Peters. a well known portrait
painter, and his wife celebrated the thir
teenth anniversary of their marriage this
evening by a weird entertainment to
their friends.
It was a feast in old dlefianlce of fate
and superstition, due to the thirteenth
anniversary cf their marriage coming on
Fridav, the thirteenth day of the month.
There are thirteen letters in Clinton
Peters' name. I-His home is 813 North
Calvert street. The hours of the dinner
was 7:15. which figures added up make
ht. The aggregate letters in the name of
the Peters' three children, Rt.h, Betty
and Jack, are thirteen. \Vorst of all
Saturn and Uranus are in conjunction,
which is another had omen.
There was a dainty how of crepe on
the Peters door hell. The thirteen friends
invited to the dinner came in somber
garb. The dinner consisted of thirteen
courses, and the menu cards, designed by
the artist himself, were in shape of tomb
stones with an appropriate inscription
for each guest, and were decorated with
weeping willows.
Hand painted plates were used with
tiny coffins depicted upon them, and the
napkinswere fitted with heavy black bor
ders for the occasion. By the plate of
each guest there was a small wreath of
immiortelles tied with a slender black
silk ribbon.
\When the plates were cleared away
the ices served would have sent a cold
chill up the back of the superstitious.
fhle ices were in the shape of individual
skulls, with cherries for eyes.
During the feast a funeral march was
softly played. To clinch the had luck
Mr. Peters had brought into his parlor
a ladder and each guest walked under it
several times. A mirror was produced
and smashed in full view of the com
pany and all the guests after the dinner
went into the garden and took a good
long peep at the moon over their left
shoulders.
The guests received as souvenirs tiny
opal stick pins, this jewel being regarded
as especially unlucky. A black dog and
an equally black cat, the latter a valuable
angora. named respectively Demon and
Satan. mingled among the guests.
Those who joined Mr. and Mrs. Pet
ers in their weird feast were Mr. and
Mrs. J. Vernon Campbell, Miss Camp
bell, Mr. and Mrs. G. Alden Peirson. Dr.
and Mrs. William Lee Howard, Miss
Katharine Grance of Cockeysville, Paul
Winchester. Jerome Pendergast and
James Brown.
RIVER FORECAST.
Reported Through the Weather Bureau.
J. W. Cronk, Official in Charge.
Red river will probably rise at Fulton
to but little above danger line of 28 feet
within the next 48 hours.
At Shreveport the highest water, prob
ably between 33.3 and 33.5 feet, may be
reached by next Tuesday with continua
tion of fair weather.
More than ordinary benefit would re
sult from fair weather during the com
ing week, as any further increase to the
last rise in the upper Red will not only
prolongate flood but might add material
ly to height of water.
Stagnation of business is generally re
ported over a considerable portion of
Red river valley, and railroad traffic has
been more or less seriously impeded
entirely suspended for weeks at some
points.
Planters, otherwise, report little dam
age except great delay in form work on
lowlands. Work is reported to have been
fairly begun on high lands.
Levees to the south of the city are still
reported to be demanding constant care,
and dry weather may prove to be more
or less essential in preventing breaks at
a few places.
Under very favorable weather condi
tions flood may entirely disappear from
low lands within next three weeks.

of a collar with a tax tag affixed there

tax of 5o cents or $t for every dog in
the city limits, and the dog h*r which
no license has been paid should perish

NEWMAN AND HYMA\N WERE
ACQUITTED.
The trial of Henry Newman and Har
ris. Hyman in New Orleans last week.
for embezzlement. resulted, as the pub
lic expected, in a verdict of acquittal:
not that the evidence was insufficient to
justify a conviction, hut that the ma
chinery of justice, as is usual in such
cases, was subordinated to the irresist
ible influence of money.
These men were wealthy cotton fac
tors, who were charged with having
sold cotton at advanced prices and hav
ing accounted to their patrons at re
duced figures, thereby defrauding them
out of thousands of dollars. The discov
ery of the fraud was made by Colonel
Buckner, a large pranter of East Car
roll. Other customers of the firm soon
found out that they also had been vic
timized. They demanded restitution. In
order to avoid litigation and consequent
publicity, they paid Colonel Buckner
$25.ooo. The others were paid different
sums aggregating upward of $ioo.ooo.
A poor devil on trial for stealing a
loaf of bread to appease the gnawing
pangs of husger of his wife and chil
dren, would have been convicted and
sent up to serve time. But mihionaiers
who have stolen more than $too,ooo
from their too confiding customers, are
relieved from all legal responsibility. yet
we are told that the scales of justice are
evenly balanced.-Alexandria Democrat.
Never mind the scales of justice nor
worry over the poor devil and the loaf
of bread. The man who so far forgets
himself as to take a loaf of bread to ap
pease the gnawing pangs of hunger has
committed a crime which, in law, is pun
ishable by imprisonment in the pen. Jus
tice being convinced that the man did
steal, must stand mute while the thief,
convicted, accepts the sentence with
resignation. A common thief should ex
pect no clemency whatever; even when
hungry he should not have stolen the
bread. If, in a speculative mood, he had
appropriated the bread, he could not
ha-e been guilty of a crime. The ends
of justice should not be misinterpreted
or misapplied. Justice demands the con
viction and 'imprisonment of the thief,
but it should be borne in mind that when
a gentleman has "speculated ," he has
ccmmitted no crime. There is a well de
fined, a positive distinction between
stealing and speculation, and theref ,re
the "scales of justice," etc., should have
no connection with the case criticised by
the Democrat.
And in its comments in the same case
the Homer Guardian-Journal says:
"Newman and Hyman. cotton factors,
were acquitted in New Orleans last
week of the charge of embezzling funds
belonging to Colonel Buckner, a cotton
planter of North Louisiana, The sub
stance of the charge was that the cotton
was actually sold at one price and ac
counted for at a different and less price,
the factors pocketing the difference.
The defendants actually restored to Col
onel Buckner some $25,ooo, and it seems
to us that the evidence clearly estab
lished their guilt. Such verdicts will not
increase the confidence of the country
in the commercial integrity of New Or
leans or in the administration of justice
in that city."

1jHE iTRIKE ITUATION.
The strike situation on the Kansas
City Southern over which the machinists.
boiler makers and blacksmiths are con
ccrned. is about unchanged. . number
of men have been secured by the com
pany to fill as many vacancies as possible
and those who can work are offered no
opposition. As usual the strikers or their
symlpathizers are persuading the tiew
c:tmers to thcir views, which is natural.
The strike is orderly and there is no
doublt that it will lbe maintained peace
ably. The strikers and their friends hope
an adjustment of the difference will be
reached at an early date.

are enthusiastic in their praise of the
contest. Detroit is one of the strongest
and best aggregations of ball players,
