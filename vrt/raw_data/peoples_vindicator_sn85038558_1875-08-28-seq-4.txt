Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg.
etablepreparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VIZEGAlt BIT
nERs I" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos.
sessing the remarkable qualities of Vix.
asoA Bimnsi in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonio,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diseases.

Alabama, Mobile, Savannah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for-the purpose
equal to DR. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR
Blrlans, as they will speedily remove
tbhe dark-colored viseid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating thei secretions of the liver,
and generally restoring the healthy funo
tions of the digestive organs.

Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impnrities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,

it when it is foul; your feelings will tell
