CELEBRATED
LIVER PILLS
FOR THE CURE OF
Hepatitis, or Liver Complaint,
DYSPEPSIA AND SICK HEADACHE.
Symptoms of a Diseased Liver.
DJAIN in the right side, under the
I edge of the ribs, increases on pres
sure; sometimes the pain is in the left
side; the patient is rarely able to lie
on the left side; sometimes the pain
is felt under the shoulder blade, and
it frequently extends to the top of the
shoulder, and is sometimes mistaken
for rheumatism in the arm. The stom
ach is affected with loss of appetite
and sickness; the bowels in general
are costive, sometimes alternative with
lax; the head is troubled with pain,
accompanied with a dull, heavy sen
sation in the back part. There is gen
erally a considerable loss of memory,
accompanied with a painful sensation
of having left undone something which
ought to have been done., A slight,
dry cough is sometimes an attendant.
The patient complains of weariness
and debility; he is easily startled, his
feet are cold or burning, and he com
plains of a prickly sensation of the
skin; his spirits are low; and although
he is satisfied that exercise would be
beneficial to him, yet he can scarcely
summon up fortitude enough to try it.
In fact, he distrusts every remedy.
Several of the above symptoms attend
the disease, but cases have occurred
where few of them existed, yet exam
ination of the body, after death, has
shown the LIVER to have been exten
sively deranged.
AGUE AND FEVER.
DR. C. MCLANE'S LIVER PILLS, IN
CASES OF AGUE AND FEVER, 'when
taken with Quinine, are productive of
the most happy results. No better
cathartic can be used, preparatory to,
or after taking Quinine. We would
advise all who are afflicted with this
disease to give them a FAIR TRIAL.
For all bilious derangements, and
as a simple purgative, they are un
equaled.

Stuart set out from his headquar
ters, east of Richmond, at about
moonrise on the night of-I think
the twelfth of June, 1862. Beyond
the city he caught up with the col
umn, which consisted of about fifteen
hunded horsemen and two pieces of
artillery, under command of Colonels
Fitz Hugh Lee, William, H. F. Lee
anti Will T. Martin, of Mississippi,
and the force proceeded northward
to the vicinity of Taylorville, where
the men went into bivouac. As this
sketch aims to record such incidents
as took place on the famous march,
I will mention that, tired out as he
was. Stuart rode on the same night
to Hickory Hill, the residence of Col.
Williams Wickersham, and fell as
leep in the chair while he was
talking. It was afterward ascertain.
ed that a Federal scouting party had
passed the house during the night,
and Stuart thus narrowly escaped
capture. They did not, however, and
the Generl returned to the cavalry
bivouac, from which he advanced
early in the morning in the direction
of Hanover Court-House.
There could be very little doubt of
a heavy picket, perhaps the enemy
in force, would here be encountered,
and this was found to be the fact,
Scouts sent in advance of the column
returned with the report that the
Court-House was held by a squadron
of Federal cavalry, and Cil,. Fits
Lee was sent round to the right to
cut them off, while Stuart charged
them in front. The charge was made
without delay, and the Southern
horsemen swept at a gallop down on
the little village, whose ancient
court-house, in its grassy yard, was
the scene of Patrick Henry's first
great speech in the "Parsons' case."
The men uttered shouts as they
charged, and the startled Federals
numbering about one hundred and
fifty-ran hastily, to their horses
and retreated at full gallop. Stuart
pressed on in pursuit without draw
ing rein at the village, but the pur
sued went faster than the pursuers
and were soon out of sight, unmo.
lested by Col. Fits Lee, who had
been directed the wrong road. The
pursuit was then discontinued and
Stuart advanced steadily on the road
leading to "Old Church," which
passed by a place called Hawes'
shop.
1UAsT 1tasasK TIE ExNIt.
At the Tattapotemois, a slurgish
stream crossed by a rustie bridge,
the enemy was met with In some
force. The picket at the bridge was
swept away at once, but in a field on
the other side a eonsiderable body of
Federal cavalry was seen drawn up
in line of battle. They were at once
charged by Col. Wm. H. F. Lee, whi

and the cireumstances here, were
these: The alarm had been given

and the piseaee of Southern eval

was obviou, therefore, that a strong

tered, after musing for a moment,
put my doubts entirely at rest.
"lcell Fits Lee to come along," he
said to me, "I am going to move on
steadily with my comumn."
"Moving on" meant a complete
circuit of McOlellan's army, with a
view to cross below.
"Well, I msaid, "my own opinion is
that the quicker we move, now, the
better."
"Right," was Stuart's rel,ly; "go
to the head of the column and tell it
to movr on at a trot."
The order was delivered, anit also
that to Col. Fitz Lee, who sounridedi

base at the "White House" landing
on the Pamunkee.
A PALSsE ALAI AND o033 FUN.
Everything was now on the gui rice,
as an attack might take place at any
moment, either on the front or rear.
A laughable incident proved that the
men were looking for one, and that
Stuart expected it would come from
the rear, as he sent me to Colonel
Martin, commanding there, with the
message:
"Tell him to have his artillery rea
dy and lookout for an attack at any
moment."
I was riding back after delivering
this order when a cry passed along
the line:
"Yankees in the rear!
Sabree flashed out, horses wheeled,
and then came a burst of laughter-
showing that the alarm was false.
Many Incldents followed on the line
of march. The people ran from
their houses, delighted at the sight
of gray coats in that blue infested re
Rion, and the men gazed with ad.
miring eyes upon a beautiful girl
who hastened up and threw her arms
around the neck of a brother in the
column, kissing him and crying
with delight. Another lncident was
the capture of a wagon full of cham
pagne and other luxuries on its way
from the Pamunkee to the quaters of 1

whisky, which was a part of the

non. This had sunk into a bottom
less mudhole of the low grounds
and was buried to the axle. The
horses were lashed and made violent I
effirts to drag it out but could not I
succeed. At this crisis one of the
men, evidently of Dutch origin, cried '
to Lieutenant McGregor, command. I
ing the guns:
"Oat, Lieutenant! the horse can't l
do it. But just put that keg of I
whisky on the gun and tell the men
they can go into it if they only pull I
through !"
The scheme was at once adopted
and the keg mounted on the cannon.
At the signal the cannoneers rushed
into the mudhole, seized the gun
carriage and lifted it bodily to firm
ground. As it mounted and was safe,
I presume the keg was dismounted.
I do not remember, having ridden
on. The alarm was now given and
wagons were seen hurrying in every
direction, They were overtaken,
rifled and set on fire-a fats shared I
by two or three Federal transjort,
on the river, from whioh a dese
bl'ek smoke arose. We were now is
sight of Tunstall's - the railway
crossing-where a heavy pioket was
stationed. This waseobargedat once,
and retreated rapidly, the ofeer in
command falling ito the hands of
the (Confederates. He had just filled
a hideous looking wooden p;pe, and
was about to light it wheat a Co
federate politely requested him to
surrender.
"I want to smoke." growled the
Federal captain, greatly disgusted,
aprently at his capture.
'80o do I, was the retort.
"The pipe is my own property I"
"Oh I what a mistake!" responded
the other, reaching from the saddle
and takidng the pipe, whlh he placed
between his own lipc.

other stores and all were now in line
eiLirits. In the morning, when we
went to Old Church, a friend haoi
said to me, gloomily: "Oen. Stuart is
going to get his whole command cut
to pieces." This same friend was
now in the most hopeful and cheer
ful of moods. After a brief rest the
column again moved, but meanwhile
a ellgbt incident had occurred In
connection with a friend of mine
living near, which he had ample
reason afterward to deplore. Hav
ing a near relative, a lady living in
the direction of the Chlckahominy, I
asked permission of Stuart to make
the attempt to see her. "It was out
of t he question," he replied, "I would
certainly be captured. I. could send
her a note through Dr. H--, living
near," and as I knew the Doctor, I
proceeded to his house for the pur
pose. He was lurking under some
trees near his house, on the lookout,
and he first took me - as he after
ward told me-for "a Yankee." I
made myself known, telling him my
errand, and was soon writing the
note for my relative in the Federal
lines, while the Doctor, opposite me,
was writing a letter to his wife, who
was in the Confederate lines. The
notes were soon finished; we ex
changed what we had written, and I
then took my departure after drink
ing a glass of water, brought by a
sulky-looking negro. My visit had
disastrous results, as I found on
meeting the Doctor a month or two
afterward in our lines. He was as
thin and pale as a ghost, and I ask
ed him if he had been sick.
"Not exactly sick," he replied; "I
have been starving for three weeks
in Fortress Monroe, where you sent
me."
"I sent you!" I exclaimed.
"Do you remember that sulky ras
cal that brought you the water on the
night you were at my house ?"
"Yes."
"Well, the very next day he sneak
ed off to the Yankee plcket at Tal
levsville and told them I had enter
tained rebels, and directed you all
how to get off safely. They arrested
me at once and put me in Fortress
Monroe. I am just out!"
TRAPPED AND OUT AGAIN.
The column moved a little past
midnight from Talleysville, and at
daylight came in sight of the Chicks
hominy, near Forge bridge. There
a sudden halt took place. The bridge
was destroyed, and it was soon found
that the fords were entirely impas
sable. The whole command was ap-I
parently caught inatrap, from which
these seemed no possibility of es-,
caping. The presence of Stuart was
perfectly well known now to Gen.
McClellan; to discover his wherea
bouts it was only necessary in fact to 4
follow the steps of his 1500 horsemen
over the sandy highway, and there
could be very little doubt that in a
few hours, at most, the Federal in
fantry, cavalry and artillery would
be upon blm and make short work
of him. As to passing the river it
seemed wholly impossible. Col. Lee
rode into the stream, but his horse
was swept down and nearly drowned.
He had just come back when I joined
him and said:
"What do you think of the situa
tion, colonel ?"
"Well, captain," he replied, coolly,
"I think we are caught."
And that they were caught was, I
am pretty certain, the impression of a
the whole command. The men were I
sitting or lying on the ground beside I
their horses, and the bravest looked
"blue." When I laughed, and told
the men not to lose heart, s all
"would be right," they gaoed at me
with a stare wbhich clearly showed I
me that they regarded me as a luna
tie. My expectatlon of getting off
sfely was based on the conviction
that a mounted man can always
swim his horse aeross a stream of
the width of the Ohlokahominy at
that point, and my confidene, too,
in Stuart's resoures, My chief un
easinesm was about the artillery, but
I believed that by hitchinag eight
horses to eaoh gun and forolng them
aeross -even if they bad to drown
the pleces could be dragged through
In some way, and I said as muob to
Stuart.
"Certainly; certainly !" be excladm
ed, twisting his long beard, as he
always did at critical moments. He
soon afterward bhurried off to a point
lower down, and I found the men
working there like beavers to con
struct a bridge. One had formerly
stood there, but had been destroyed,
the abutments only remaining. As
the gap to be spanned war not great,
however, Stuart resolved to bridge
it, and the men hastened to tear
down a barn near by and bring the
timberon their bshoulders. A little
skitff was then flostaed to the middle
oflthestream between the abutments,
whel it was held by a rope in the
bow tied to a tree trunk aove, and
the men standing in the bsoat raised
the ends of the timbers as they were
lowered and pushed them on the op
posite abutment. In this work 8tu
art assisted with his own hands,
standing in the boat and singing.
As soon as the timbers were laid
acros, planks were placed upon
them and the artillery and cavalry
defiled over safely. 8tuart followed
last, the bridge was torn up and the
column moved on-they were out of
the trap. It was a close grases. As
they disappeared in the folTlae of the
morass shots irom the opposite bank
were heard, and C3ol. Rush came
down with his "Ifsancers" in full ar
ray. The game had esecaped, and
eol. Rush was forced to return with
out his prise. When asked, on hisb
way baek, by a lady, if he had
"eauht Stuart," his reply was, the
lady informed me:
"No, madam. He has gone in at
the back door. I only saw bis rear
guard as it passed the swamp."

WEnsrTE: The Tribune reports
"Green backer's to the front."
SAEutE: The Southron sagys: We
have reports of the appearance of
some cotton wormts in a few farms in
this parish, which are as yet in an
embryo state, and it is not likely
that they will commence their rava
ges upon the oten to any great ex
tent for several weeks,
trfcniLD: Th1t Beacon reports:
There is some little summ:ar cickness
in this community, but no curious
illness we believe.
The crops of this parish are very
spotted; while in some spots the
corn is good, in others it is very sor
ry. Some say they will ma:tl a full
crop; others will scircely make a
half crop. Ho It is hard to say wheth
er thbre will be enough 'Â·adlo to sup
ply the demand or not, but we guess
not. The cotton crop will fall be
low an average, whether there are
worms or not, but not far below; for
though small, it is well fruited and
most of it was not stopped from
growing by the drouth, though
cbecked.
Last Sunday, during an tntermis
sion In the services at the Holly
Grove Colored Baptist church in tLis
pariah, some of the young people got
into a play in the house, and some
one went to the door and called out,
"It you don't stop such a racket in
there the house will fall down on
you!" It was misunderstood as a
warning that the house was falling
and the crowd became panic stricken
and made a rush for the door. In
the stampede several women and
children were borne down and tram
pled upon, and one child had its arm
broken, but no more serious injury
requlted to any one we believe.
Mr. J. H. Bunch, while riding a
mule, near Point Jefferson last Mon
day, got into a yellow Jacket's nest
and was thrown from its back, and
had his right shoulder and arm ter
ribly wrenched, if not broken, which
renders him almost entirely helpless,
as it disables him from using his
crutches, without which he cannot
walk. He is at the hotel in this
place.
OarsmT: The Chroncle says: Mr. I
Alf. W. Bell, who was sentenced to
pay a fine of fifty dollars and to
twenty days imprisonment at the
last district court, has been pardoned
from serving the term in prison by
Governor Nicholls, the fline to remain
in effect. The pardon was received 1
last Monday, and Mr. Bell liberated '
accordingly, having then but seven
days to serve, as he had already
passed thirteen days within the clas
sic walls of our jill. This is a merit
ed pardon, and meets the approba
tion of our citizens.
DESoro: A BLOODY FtGnT.-As 4
Mr. James Halley was leaving town I
on Saturday last, he met a negro in I
front of a private residence, who was
using very profane language. Mr.
Halley suggested that he had better I
get out of the hearing of the ladies, .
when the darkey becaming enraged,
began cursing Halley, Mr. ap. -
proached him when the negro drew
a pistol and fired at him, but fortu
nately the shot mised the mark. i
Mr. Halley then went to Col. Herlot's
residence, borrowed a pistol, puraed
and overtook the negro near Mr. W.
B. Jackson's when the fight began,
several shots were fired, which re
suited in the negro getting a bullet
through his arm, after a severe hand
to hand fight. Mr. Hailey succeed
ed in overpowering the negro and
tieing him brought him to town,
where he was jelled charged with as
sault with intent to kill.-Demoorat.
AVOt.L.L. : The Bulletin says: Up
to this time the health of the pari I
is very good. We hear of a few iso
lated eases of ordinary fevers, but
these yield readily to a few doses of
quInine. Later in the season, how.
ever, these fevers become more com
plicated but be who is wise "takes
time by the forelock" and aots the
part of prudence by keeping the sys
tem thoroughly cleansed.
Up to thi date we have heard of
no reliable rumors of eaterpllarm.
On the bayous wherethey make their
nrst appearance the planters tell us
that a few worms have been found,
but these are supposed to be grass
worms, The cotton crop throughout
the parlsh looks exceedingly well;
It is maturriog very fast and the bot
om bolls are opening very fast. We
suppose that at the end of the season
we will have the same old tune to
slug-a- big crop and small prices.
When will our people cease to travel
in the asme old grooses When will
they learn that it is to their interest
to plant more cereale and less of cot.
ton We fear that they will not un
derstand the "true condition of
things" until too late-when they
will have ruined themselves and an
voived all thome around themselves
into bankrupcy.
Oaur parish Rleorder Informs us
that he has registered in his office
this year fuily four hundred con- 1
tracts, representing our local trade
and are entered into between our1
home merchants and their custom
ers. A close calculation of the
amount covered by these contracts
and of advances actually made reach
the sum of flty thousand dollars.
And now when we add to this the
stil larger amount of advances ob
tained by larger planters from com
mission merehants in New Orleans,
we may well ask the farming classes
if they can posslbly prosper and
grow rich with such a heavy debt
banging over them, and which must
eat out the larger portion of their
bard earninogs. The credit system in
this country Is the curse of the peo
ple sant will always keep them poor.
Howto get ridof It is the problem
which must be solved. And until
this is done a cloud of sadness and
of suffering must hang over us.
