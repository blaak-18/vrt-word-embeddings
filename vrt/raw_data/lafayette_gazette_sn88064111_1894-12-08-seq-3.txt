before the State Bfoarl of Medical
E -amincrs (homeopathy). He re
turned Tuesday.
Cards are out announcing the
marriage on Dec. i8, of Mr. Joseph
Ducote and Miss Caroline Martin,
both of this town.
SThe genial Bob Cunningham, ex
editor of the Rayne Ranger, passed
through Lafayette Sunday on his
way to Rayne. He returned Mon
day morning to St. Mary parish to
resume his work in a refinery.
Mr. Jno, J. Bell will replace AMr.
C. BI. Porch as agent of the W\ater
Pierce Oil Company at this place.
It will be remembered that Mr.
Bell held that position before and
is well known by our people.
The Rev. D. W. Spurlin, synodi
cal evangelist, will preach at the
Presbyterian church at the usual

Jack Allen, a man who was work
ing at Oxnard & Sprague's in St.
Mary parish, called at Dr. Mudd's
office \Vednesd(ay to have his arm
bandaged, it having been ibroken
Dy an accident which occurred in
the refinery.
The governor has appointed T".
A. McFadden justice of peace fuo
this ward, vice WV. E. Iowen, re
signed. Mr. M.cFadden's appoint
inent is an excellent one and iieets
with the approval of the people.
Gus. T.acoste is always ready to
sell yoet anything you may need in
his line. lle has a large assort
muent of heating and cookifig stoves
trom the best manufactures iit the
country. His prices are low and

The Gazette has received an in
vitation to attend the nuptials of
Major Frank T. (;uilbeau, a prom -
ising young member of the legal
profession, to Miss Caroline Rous
s -au an accomp ishel young lady.
Both are prominent in the social
circles of St. Martinville where the
marriage will take place on the I2th
instan t.
Albert Heywood, the popular
young comedian appeared in Falk's
Opera House last Saturday night.
Mr. lHeywood had never played in
Lafayette and was not known by
our people,and for these reasons the
audience was not as large as his ex
traordinary talent entitled him to.
Mr. Heywoodl is supported by a
strong company and his show was
one of the best that has visited
Lafayette for some time. We un
derstand that it is his intention to
return here and it is to be hoped
that he will. Now that the people
know him they will doubtless show
their appreciation of his merits.
Charles Devoe, an old and expe
rienced engineer on the Southern
P'acific and well and favorably
known in Lafayette, had his arm
badly broken in an accident which
happened at Raceland a few dlays
ago. It appears that his train ran
into the rear car of a cane train
which had been switched into a
siding to clear the main track for
the passenger. The railroad em
ployes had incorrectly guaged the
distance of the last car from the
main track, and the rear car pro
jected just enough to encounter the
engine of the passenger and the en
gineer was caught in the debris
with the result stated above.
Mrs. Gen. Tom Thumb and her
company of liliputians performed
"Wednesday and Thursday at the
Opera House and played to goodtl
houses each time. The entertain
ment was very interesting and novel.
The little people made quite a cred
itable appearance and showed con
sitlerable histrionic ability. 'The
performnance was uvortih the price ,f
admission andi wa~s fully "up to e
peetation, with the exception of the i
prestigilator and funny man, whose
tricks were hoary with age anti
whose jokes tottered with years. Hie
told wormi-eatan chesnuts with adl
mirable nerve. BIut let's not be too
hard on.the funny man; he did his
best and, was quite comical andl
made everybody laugh.
Our cane planters are i' a sad
predicament. 'raey c,tuot get cars
to ship their cane. Some refiners
claim that cane from this section
is not ripe and consequently they
will not furnish cars to shippers.
Some people, who have reliable
means of information, are of the
opinion that the refiners will not
buy cane now because their mills
are overcrowded. Be it as it may,
the small planters are at the mer
cy of tle large ones who, it is to
be hoped, will do the right thing.
Even should the warm weather con
tinue this delay will be very seri
ously felt by our planters, and in
case cold weather sets in, it will
cause a total loss to many of them
who have not winrowed their cane.
It is indeed'unfortunate that those
who have planted cane should be so
badly treated. Let us hope that
this will impress our people with
the absolute necessity of having re
fineries of their own. Unless they
build refineries it is only a matter of
time when cane culture will have to
be stopped.
Real Estate Agent Wanted.
Lafayette needs a live, hustling
real estate agent. Such a person
would be the means of bringing
to our section a desirable class of
emmigrants, as the following letter
addressed to the postmaster will
show. As willbe seen by the first
part of this letter, the writer is a
breeder of hogs in Iowa, who de
sires to move South. There is no
better field for hog raising than is
to be found in this parish, and
should Mr. Sweeny conclude to
come here he will soon see for him
self. We do not know of any real
estate agent in Lafayette but should
there be one let him write to Mr.
Sweeny and give him the informa
tion about the price of lands, etc.:

Ti e Franklia \ indlicator prints
the name of \\'mt. McKinley for
president and the Franklin Banner
has the name of i)avid Hill at its
nmasthiead. For the sake of har
niony in t~heir respective parties,
the St. \Mary editors should not be
to premature in forcing the claims
of their favorites to the front.
St. Mary has a governor and a
United States senator and her news
papers persist in dictating the presi
dential candidates for both parties.
In all seriousness what do these

they will kick about it being too

Thrifty Town - Reported
for the Colhinns of 'i'he
Gazette.
-"Thanksgiving day" was beau
tifully observed at the Thea!l
school, Prof. Toler principal.
This is the first time that "Tl'hanks
givi',g clay" was made a public cele
bration in this section of the parish.
Prof. Toler had neatly prepared a
long and interesting programme, and
the sequel, with its fatted "gob,"
and delicious cakes and coffee,
made one feel like having "Thanks
giving day" a weekly affair. The
National day concecrated to respect
and prayer, was solemnly celebrated
by our people, demonstrating that
true patriotism of the southern pco
ple; also showing, that down here
in Southwest Louisiana there ex
ists the ideal born American, always
ready and eager to answer to the
cause of American Liberty and In
dependence. The opening cere
monies were a vocal selection, with
autoharp accompaniment, by Mr.
Hlooley. Then followed Prof. To
ler, in a brilliant, but short intro
ductory speech. Prof. TWebb, of
Royville, then ably entertained the
audience, with a few remarks in En
glish, explaining the origin etc., of
,"Thanksgiving day." Mr. Webb
was warmly applauded. Mr. J. R.
Domengeaux then spoke in French,
followed by Mr. Perrodille, who
made an earnest appeal in behalf of
education. Dr. Cushman, of Mil
ton, then delivered a brilliant
speech, earning for himself, the
just title of the "Doctor Orator."
The evening ended with a comical
recitation, entitled "An Inventor's
Wife," delivered with ease and fac
ilty by Miss Walker, of Arnaud
ville. It now remains but to thank
Prof. Toler cordially, for his kind
invitation to a:tend. "Cherokee"
attended with much pleasure, and
he and all who were present ac
knowledge with due praise and ad
,miration, that Prof. Toler is
worthy andl (le.erving. It was he
who invited our people in. observ
ing that National day, and to him
the people of this ward render
thanks. May the "Theall school"
with Prof. Toler as principal, ever
flourish, is the ardent wish of this
community.
