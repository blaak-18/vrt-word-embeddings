FRIDAY, APRIL S6, 0196.
It
Grover Cleveland is marshalling t
his pie-counter forces (all he hash
to fight the people and popllar
government in the interest of Gold
bugs, Wall street and the Devil.
Th, church must come out on
the sitle of the people or die. It
can't live while it holds on to the
skirts of plutocracy.
There is a good deal more noise
being made about that shot that
was fired at an American ship by a
Spanish gunhoat than there is about
the raid which the English syndi
cate made on the United States
treasury, in which they "scooped"
us for $10,(40,000.
The only railroads m North Car
olina that are not in the hands of
receivers are the two in which the
State owns a controlling interest.
Oh, yes, government ownership of
railroads would be a disastrous
thing-for the receivers. They
would be out of a job.-Star and
Kansan.
_ i=  - -
Fort Worth Gazette, one of the
great Democratic dailies of Texas, I
says that if the Democratic party '
is to regain its prestige it must re
pudiate Clevelandism. Can the
leopard chance his spots? After
the Democratic party has brought t
ruin upon the country is it foolish
enough to think that it can set it
self right and deceive the people
by merely saying, We didn' do it?
Let it repudiate Clevelandism ten
thousand times and it will not re
ceive absolution for its sins. The
Demnocratic party has been given a
"chaace;" it has run its race.
Justice White delivered a pow
erful dissenting opinion in the in
como tax case decided by the Unit
ed States supreme court on Mon
day. Justice White shows that
the decision is against an unbroken
line of precedents as to the right
of congress to levy an income tax.
He concludes his decision with
these ominous words: "In my
judgment the position here assum
ed is full of danger to our institu
tion'. The august power lodged
in this court of passing on the con
stitutionality .of acts of congress
has always been discreetly and
carefully exercised. I believe this
is the first case in our history where
authority which has been conceded
to congress by nearly one hundred
years of acquiescence in all de
artments of the government and
hasbeen sanctioned by repeated
adjudications of this court, has
been judicially denied." These
are strong words to come from a
member of the court. What in
fluences were at work to induce
members of the supreme court to
reverse "repeated adjudications"
of their own body? Why have
they suddenly taken such a radical
new departure contrary, as Justice
White says, to the long established
"acquieoneene in all departments
of the government" and diametri
cally opposed to their own prece
dents, which usually are so closely
adlhered to by courts The whole
affair is very unfortunate and not
ealoulated to increase respect eith

Your correspnr'(rt. Mr-'.r; Groh cc
:and L. M. G., are 1.ecomin e!zmevntary to
in t ,e -ubject of money. I will en
deavor to follow them. 1 disclaim orig
inality, which Mr Groh thinksis so fun- he
ny, and take up the authorities, and I
first. as to whetheror not the conditions hr
of depression or pro-perity prevailing to
at any given time depend on the quan- pc
City or quality of money in circulation, in
I cite Mc('ul!och--who says "It is pos- !a
'blhe, by sufliciently limiting its quanti- to
tv to raise its value in exchange to auny t
econceivaihle extent." This simply meanus I:
that it is posibec by sutliciently limiting h(
the money supply to make the dollar ui
command any conceivable quantity of h:
product or labor, and conflicts with Mr. he
t;roh's idea on the subject ; bt some fu
econmists of the New York Tribune ti
school thinks that when you bear on ai
prices of commodities, you add to a
people's prosperity. Professor Nichol- s<
Oll says our most important factor in p
determining the general level of prices n
in a country, is the quantity of money o
in circulation." p
"And. in fact, we cannot proced aT
single step in any argument on general a
prices without assuming their depend- ti
ence on the quantity of money." a
Hut I have before shown by the re- n
Scords that the professed purpose of de- I
monetization was to decrease the money u
I supply, and thereby reduce all prices. n
It must th;en have been assumed that p
the prices of commodities, labor and I
the conditions of all trades, did depend h
upon the quantity of money, and the b
fact that price does depend upon the e
money supply, ought not now to be a
questioned by any informed person. It
is a fact as Mr. Groh states, that the a
creditor will press the debt-or in case w( t
attempt the relief of the debtor and a
producer by increasing the money sup- a
ply by supplementing gold with silver. I
I do not see that that would better the I
situation of the creditor, because we '
shall inevitably reduce the value of his I c
enhanced money, thus irung from the
debtor to its just, equitable and proper
level. Cousequently the creditor could
gain no advantage by hurrying a pay- I
ment in enhanced money to-day, and 9
which money must, to-morrow, drop to t
the level of all other money.
Since I have learned that Mr. Groh is I
a disciple of Henry George, I think it t
is well I so soon gave up the atttempt c
to draw him out of the one idea rut. Is
thank him for Mr. Johnson's speech,
but will reciprocate with Sibley's speech.
Now as the next idea treated by both t
your correspondents--the intrinsic val
ue theory of money-the authorities
run in this wise :
"The theory of the intrinsic value of t
money has been abandoned by the best I
writers and speakers,"-Enc. Britan
nica.
"An article is determined to be mon- c
ey by reason of the performance by it t
of certain functions without regard to I
its form or substance, "-App's. Am.
Encyclopedia.
"That upon which the stamp is placed
is called coin; the coin may be metal,
parchment or paper. The value is in i
the stamp, not in the metal or materi- I
Ial."-Judge Tiffany's Const'l Law.
"Government, like the Spartan raw- I
giver, may put its stamp upon leather
and make that currency : and so long
as it can provide against counterfeit
ing of the same, and so regulate the
quantity in use, it can give its stamp
upon the leather the same value as if 1
t put upon gold, silver or any other sub
I stance."-Tiffanyv.
Mr. L. M. G., says the government
ought not to coin a dollar on its own
account; what does Tiffany say ? "As
the people of the United States confer
red upon Congress the'plenary authori
ty to coin money and regulate its value,
and denied to the States the exercise of
I such powers, they thereby made it the
duty of Congress to make all necessary
provision for supplying the nation with
mensy as a medium of exchange. It
was the intention of the people that this
power should be exercised in such man
net as to make the currency of the na
tion adequate to' any emergency that
might arise.
"There is need in every society of ex
a change. It is a public necessity as well
as private; and it should be provided
in such a way asto subserve the pub
a lic as well as private use. The necessi
Sty which requifres money as a medium
n of exchange at all, requires that this
a public anthority should make the sup
j ply, at least equal to the imperative de
Smand of the publie welfare."
"The people are eminently and po
a litieally potent in Congres to adminis
- ter their own authority by legislation.
Therefore they may be as safely en
y trusted withb the exercise of their an
e thority to coin money and regulaLte the
it value as they were to institute the gov
- ernment, and ordain by whom that pow
Ser should be exerised."-Tifany's
e ConsLt'l. Law.
* Mr. Groh has well msaid that money is
merely a vehicle of exchange; but he
thinks his vehicle should have lntrinsice
Svalue. In this he difersfrom thesu
r theribtes.
o Agalst the sound loglo of Tifany,
and all the best wrlters and speakes of
the day ruered to by the Enr. ritan
' l.e. Mr. Or eaot peveiall, and what
Sle to beeome evemn lly. o both gold
I and eilver.
Judge hay sarys that the eutihfty

scele't the vetic!c or su.lStalner to re
ecive and e.rrN the sttrmp with regard M1
to itt ec;onomy, eit:Lpnec4.
Nout long since in conve sI rion with a
long-headed jeweller in Baton Rouge, ca
he said, "I understand the situation; to
I know what is the matter: the people it
have received nothing for their products If
for so long that they have become so fe
poor they can't buy. and we are suffer- e,;
ing from undercuonsumnption. ''But," ''
said he : You people are going next (
to attack gold.' I had said noth!in on ti
that point, or on leg.l tender, but he s
has his money in gold and jewelry, and it
he knows the weakne-s of gold. lie '
under.stands the great artiti'ial value it i1(
has taken on in the last 20 years, andltl t
he fears that it may becuome necessary
for the people to pull down this- idol of
the 19th century, as did 1Moses of olt.
and so distroy the value of his property.
I have Icen reading the Presidents cl
sound money letter to the ('hicago peo- i 2
pie. From his remark that it would el
not matter so much as to the character t
of our money, if we were an isolated e
people. I judge he has been reading
Tiffany, or sonic other good authority,
and that therefore his stock of informa- k
tion on the finance question is at best Is
as good as his grammar. The President tl
might study to advantage, Colwell's
History of the Bank of Venice. lie
might thus learn that the principal
money of account at a premium of 20
per cent over gold and silver, in the si
Republic, was the fiat money of the a
bank; that the rate of discount had to 11
be limited by statute to prevent it fromn
exceeding 20 per cent: and that the
metals were but little used, except as
commodity in settlement of foreign bal- b
ances : and, finally, that this bank con
tinually increased its business through
a period of 600 years, without a panic, e
and that it only suspended when the tl
Republic was overthrown by Napoleon. v
In the light of the sound logic of Judge I1
Tiffany, we might all study this piece f
i of history to advantage. f
The points then in favor of intrinsic 11
value money, are : 1st, It may be used t]
in barter to settle foreign lbalances. 2d, g
It retains its commodity value after the 11
government issuing it may have ceased r
to exist. t
The first of these points may be met
by the proposition that bullion would b
better answer for the settlement of for
eign balances ; and there is every rea
son why a properly regulated legal ten- N
der, such as is indicated by Judge Tiffa
ny, should command a premium over
the metals, when required for such uses
in bullion. Except for pocket change,
every one prefers paper. beeause of con
venience of carriage and handling, and
the preferred money should be at a pre- l
mium.
As to the other argument of retention
of value after the power issuing has
ceased to exist. I should not think that
under a republican form of government
this would be a point so mach in favor
of intrinsic value money, as against
it, under the full legal tender system it
would be the interest of every one liv
ing under the protection of the govern- I
ment issuing his money. to uphold the
power behind his money ; and assuring
to his property a value. The immense
ly rich are not so readily inclined to be
take themselves to foreign shores with
their riches. It is a dangerous thing to
give to money too much power, inde
pendently of the power issuing it. Un
der such conditions money may cease to
be the hand-maiden of commerce, and
constitute itself Imaster of the nation.
How far are we now from that period of
our history; or may not we have al
ready reached it ?
INow as to Mr. Groh's ideas on the
land question: Observation and my
own experience convince me of their
fallacy. Under a fairly adjusted finance
Ssystem, founded in reason, not super
p stitmon, 1 can see no objection to private
Sownership of land propety regulated.
SThere are abuses of land ownership
Sthat should be corrected, no doubt, but
Snot to the extent of discouraging private
ownership entirely.
Yours truly,
J. T. HDWELL.

I ago were "on the fence" as regards
the finance question are now warm

with a majority of the people.

said:
"If it had any other nam,. than

a document it would ihs' rid i.uled

letter is remarkable in this, that it
is the tirst instance in the history
of the country in which a prei i
dent of the i'nited States, after!
- usin5 all the powers of the 'v
ernlient, has. in addition, conde-
condehl to write for the newspapo.ra
1 in order to serve his masters. For
this letter was intended to start a
lxoom and has been advertised for
a week in order to give it an au
' dienee. Other presidents have
s been used as a convenience by class
I interests, but this is the first time
in which a )president's name has
been dragged ,ou00 miles outside of
I Washington City for that purpose.
- 'After nominating Mir. Cleve
t land three times and electing him
twice to the presidency, the stand
ard oil and Wall street lpeople got
him to use all the powers of gov
ernment to further their schemes.
I The country has been astound, d to
r see postoflices and patronage usedt
to coerce congress into doing the
bidding of the east, from striking
down silver to packing of a su
pI reme court. In the meantime the
V country has been going from bad
to worse. With abundant crops,
e with the most industrious, intelli
gent and enterprising people to be
found on earth, we are in a paraly
zed condition, brought on by no
C natural cause, but by the arbitrary
o acts of a number of the govern
4ments of the world controlled by
the influences of the salaried class sl
es and of the mondholding classes 01
it of Europe and America. These
wanted to make all property and
i commodities cheap and money dear, ti
eand they have succeeded. 01
"The result is that the purcha- I
n sing power of the producing class- s
es has been destroyed, while all
the debts, taxes and other fixed
charges remain the same. It takes
all the people can get together to
meet the fixed charges. Conse
quently labor is idle and the great
producing classes are in distress
Sant they are finding out the cause. y
They have learned that the so-call- I,
ed 'honest dollar' is the most dis- ci
Y honest dollar ever in demand for it
f- compels the .debtor to give twice as c'
in much property to pay his debts as i
'h would have been necessary at the
time the debt was contracted. How
tdoes the president's letter offer
Ig remedy for these peoplle? None.
t- They have been bled until they can C
r not stand up and he simply tells
td them to be content. They know
that until they get more blood they
' cannot do business. They have
er submitted to this ruinous policy
ie long enough and demand a change.
!y The eastern manipulators see this
e and in order to keep their grip
upon the government are arrang
- ing to again delude the people.
- For this purpose they are going to
start a boom and as it is the west
ern people who were to be duped I
it was decided to start the boom in
Chicago, and in order to draw the
w crowd they concluded to take the a
n president out, but before they got a
him there the atmosphere became
at chilly and they had to give this up,
of then they did the next best thing,
they got him to write a letter for
publication. It has come and the'
a boomlet that will be born of this
le will be such a little one that it will
not reflect on the virtue of its moth
