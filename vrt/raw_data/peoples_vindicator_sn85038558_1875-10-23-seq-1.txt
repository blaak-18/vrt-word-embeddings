In one of a dozen instanceS ill whlich
white lmenl and IIe.roes have ebeesl

ticipated in n .gro debate e lllndnltetd

legedit white main drifting alhont inl
negro chuirches or ill negro political
assebllies, llthe nlleglro slotild knowlill
that such a white iman, whatever his
.position ort abliiities, is we;e than la
thief. He assanillns to 1e1 a nieg1'r withl
at white skin anld is only a wolf in
sheep's clothing. He absolutely hates
himself for wlit lie dolesL, and, when
lie colies out, privately .coufes hi
Contaminatllillio atlld boasts amilng dir
ty office sreekerti like himself of the
successiful fraud he has practiced l lupons
the innocent ilacks. Negroes in Mib
sissippi are tired of thlese shluams, and
when a white riogue conles into one
of their asselmblies his life is hardly
worth the having. It is propel
enough, and we loln't .ee why the
New York If'orld condemlns Gov.
Alnes. who refused to intervene in
Vicksburg when the races were aboutll
to e0llide in that city., Amies is ver

State algalilnt Alcorn lie are anlld slept

Spractices ,a sh e mulst if they occuply,
alifter one of his jaunlits into the coun

seen even how he is suspected by the
blacks of insincerity, and knows well
enough that the co-existence of the
races, as laws are now olerative, on
terms of egqmiality is simply impilossible.
lIe was not, as the New York World
sippotIse, simply indifferent when hie
knew many negroes would be slauigh
tered, alll lie was not siiply desir
lls of adlding ghastly stainsi to the
reekiig, bloody shirt constituting his
iarty banner in the North, but Ames
was colnscious that forty dead men,

inllfomed that ihe stores of .I. C. Lo- I

T'hese are two mlore of the conlltry
stores which prcllehlased seed cotton.
We are told that tile mnen engaged in
thlis bllsiness ate dressed in white, I
very muach resemblinlg ghosts. They
had given notice to both Messrs. Lo-.
pez and Glasper to move their goods,
that tihe stores wotelhl, be burned, and
thle failulre to do so, entails upon thel
the loss of their goods.
We omlitted to mlention in our last
issue tile burning of Mr. C. M. Bar

b)y a uImber of white nllld colored
nllsked lmer. Jack )Davis had ljust
Sopened time store and had done con
Ssiderable business in the way of Imuy
ing seed cotton. He was told to re
rmove tihe contents of tie store, and
hIe wais hellped to do so, thatt they ihad
coie to burn the store. This in tile
result of a ,comlbinatlion formed by tlhe
I merchantst in town and pIlanters ill
thle colntry .Ioth to pireveit cttotI
slenlillg, onle lto get the rellts of the

Will Keeping heep Pay I-A wri.
terin tlhe Natioenal Live Stock Jour
nal gives his idea on the suiject:
Sheep pay better than any other
stock, no matter what the kind of
stock in. I have been feeding some
800 head of cattle, and I am satisfied
that, even with the most favorable
emndltio ltr selling, when tihe time
coames, I shall lnake a gtet delal more
ollnev, dollar for dollar, on the mon
ey invested il siheep, than I shall
make on the capitAl invested in cat
tle. I have abatd G610 sheep, runlniing
without any partilenlar Attention of
eare, and shave sold $1,400 worth df
wool of this year's clii, and haa~r
250 lambs besides. I do nota think it
Posojnle to Ihave done as well on asrs
equal amo(ulllt of capitall invested ill
cattle. One great advantage shep
have over oilither stck is, they bver
die of the contaagious diseases which
they en tract. They get the seab or
fant.-rot r soamneliting else, and if nlmt
checked it gets thein in' ba.d condi-'
tiion, and would hltimately, hperhal4ps
kill them. hlat the very worst con
I taginas diseases to which sheep are
sI ubject, give the owner ample time
to treat tile aBieted lanimals, and the
Iliseaes aire generally of a character.
Siwhich yield readily toa treatment.
