the highest bidder and only a part to the

An independent concern had underbid
the Steel Trust, but the moguls of the
Trust rushed to Washington, had a pri
vate interview with Bonaparte, and got
a big half of the contract.
After that, competition was a dream.
The Hearst League commences its na
tional campaign with a sumptuous feast
in a high-priced New York Hotel. Those
present were mostly the well-selected
gentlemen whose names are carried on
the Hearst pay-roll.
All reforms that accomplish any good
purpose, come from below, —originate
among the people.
Banquet-hall reform isn’t much.
As to the Hearst League, it will just
about get what the Hearst millions can
buy.

The Senate Committee on Appropria
tions have decided to spend $400,000 in
the purchase of a palace in Paris, France,
for the U. S. “embassy.”
There isn’t a man in America who can
give a single good reason why this na
tion, or any other, should be represented
abroad by costly diplomatic establish
ments.
They are relics of barbarism. They
may have been useful in olden times when
there were no steam ships, no steam
cars, no post-office systems, no tele
phones, telegraphs and cables. In this
day when any government can communi
cate with any other, instantaneously,
there is absolutely no need of diplomatic
establishments. When delicate business
of an unusual character is to be transact
ed, a special envoy is always sent even
now.
Why not abolish these extravagant and
useless “embassies” and do business on
common-sense principles ?

This Government has become so impe
rially splendid that every one of our pub
lic servants of high degree wants an au
tomobile, furnished and maintained by
you, the taxpayers.
Sometimes we could almost entertain
a doubt as to whether we are not the
servants and the officials our bosses.
At any rate, they spend our tax money
much more freely than they do their
own.

brother Tibbles Is Wrong.
In the last issue of his Investigator,
Hon. T. H. Tibbles falls into a very sur
prising error. He says that Mr. Watson
has repudiated the money plank of the
Populist platform.
THE JEFFERSONIAN.
Mr. Watson ha§ not done anything of
the kind.
We distinctly stated that we could not
endorse that new and socialistic feature
of the platform which makes it the duty
of the Government to furnish jobs to the
“unemployed.”
We did not refer to the money plank
at all.
We respectfully request Mr. Tibbles
to make the proper correction.

Populist Money Plank.
There are forms of words into which
can be thrown the Populist theory of
Money, but as to the principle itself no
two Pops differ.
Inasmuch as we have been represent
ed as repudiating the money plank recent
ly adopted at St. Louis, we copy it, here,
and take this occasion to say that we
have never even thought of repudiating
it.
How_. such an idea could have got
abroad is more than we can figure out.
“Money.
“The issuance of money is a function
of government and should not be dele
gated to corporations or individuals. The
Constitution gives Congress alone the
power to issue money and regulate the
value thereof. We therefore demand that
all money shall be issued by the govern
ment direct to the people without the in
tervention of banks and shall be a full
legal tender for all debts, public and pri
vate, and in quantity sufficient to supply
the needs of the country.”
The Laba and the Neal "Bank
Deposit.
It gave the Jeffersonian pleasure to
publish what Governor Smith had to
say in explanation of the renewal
of the $50,000 note which the bank held
against the State when the bank had on
deposit more than double that amount of
the State’s money.
Our readers, after a careful considera
tion of the Governor’s letter, probably
reached the conclusion that he did a risky
and unusual thing. The $50,000 note, upon
the failure of the Neal Bank, might have
turned up in the possession of some New
York bank where it had been used as col
lateral. and the assets of the bank might
not have been sufficient to pay off the one
creditor that the court —with doubtful le
gality —preferred to the other 9,000 depos
itors.
But aside from this, let us ask how it
was that the Neal Bank had so much of
the State's money? The Acts of 1893
limit the sum which may be deposited in
any one bank to SIOO,OOO. This is a wise
law and its purpose is obvious enough. A
limit of $50,000 would be still better.
Why was the law ignored?
Was the Treasurer aware of the limit
fixed by statute? Did he err through ig
norance of the law?
Did the Governor not know, at the time
he renewed the note to the Neal Bank,
that the bank already had more of the
State’s money than the law allows?
When he renewed the note, thus adding
$50,000 to a deposit that was already il
legal, did he not do wrong?
As we understand it, both these officers
—Treasurer and. Governor —are lawyers.
They were both solemnly sworn to obey
the law.
Why did they not do it?
The Jeffersonian will promptly publish
anything that either of these public ser
vants may have to say.
It seems to us that the question we ask
is a serious one. The handling of trust
funds is always a delicate matter. Favo
ritism in the placing of the public deposits
never looks well, and always arouses criti
cism. When that favoritism seems to
amount to a plain violation of law, on the
part of sworn officers, the state is deeply
concerned.
When the Neal Bank failed on the 21st
of December, 1907, it had on deposit
$200,000 of the State’s money —twice as
much as the extreme limit fixed by law.

Should a Candidate Make Speeches?
Sometimes, we have our doubts as to
whether so much campaign oratory
amounts to anything serious in the way
of results. Very few speakers are vote
getters. It even happens, now and then,
that the speeches of the Candidate lose
him counties which were conceded to him
before he “took the stump.”
Consider the case of the late and not
inconsolately lamented Dupont Guery.
That gentleman had a splendid platform
and a weak opponent; yet, by the time
Dupont had got fairly under way with his
oratory, he had a weak platform and a
strong opponent. If the Prohibition Can
didate, Guery, had just been able to sit
still and keep watch and ward on his
tongue, he would have beat Joe Terrell
out of his boots.
“Talked to death” was the epitaph
which we Prohibitionist wrote on the slab
where Joe Terrell, Hoke Smith, Clark
Howell, “and among ’em,” had buried our
eloquent but unwise Dupont and his Dry
platform.
Examine our list of Presidential candi
dates and see how. few of them made
stump speeches.
George Washington made none.
Thomas Jefferson made none.
John Adams, John Quincy Adams,
James Madison, James Monroe made
none.
Neither did Andrew Jackson, nor Mar
tin Van Buren, nor General Harrison,
nor James K. Polk, nor Franklin Pierce,
nor James Buchanan.
Henry Clay made stump speeches when
he was a Candidate, but could never win
enough votes over the wiser men who
guarded their tongues.
Daniel Webster made speeches in the
interest of his candidacy, blit could never
even secure the nomination.
