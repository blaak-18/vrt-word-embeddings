Summary of Events as They H'append
The Ballinger-Pinchot row has not
quieted at the wave of Mr. Taft’s
The Two
Cabinet Officers
Still at Odds.
Taft broadcasted an
elaborate defense of the Secretary,
which had about it the semblance of
calm, judicial findings. But, alas,
he fell into the error of presenting
only a part of the truth, which at
once removes from the document its
deceptive dignity of tone and puts it
where it belongs—in the category of
partisan pleading. Mr. Pinchot does
not hesitate to continue his fight
against Ballinger, and his reiteration
of the TTiarges of the formation of a
gigantic power trust, to which Bal
linger is subservient. Ex-Governor
Pardee, of California, recently came
out in a card which throws much
light upon the one-sided, delusive
character of the President’s state
ments in regard to the Cunningham
land claims. He had been among
those chided for criticising the Inte
rior Department, and his reply cer
tainly shows his criticism justified.
He said:
“At the irrigation congress I read
a copy of a letter approved by Secre
tary Ballinger and directing that over
four million acres of land, previously
withdrawn by Garfield to save power
sites from being grabbed, should be
restored to entry. This was but one
of the several similar orders ap
proved by Secretary Ballinger. The
President mentions but one order of
Ballinger’s restoring to entry only
one million and a half acres and says
this order of restoration was upon a
recommendation of the reclamation
service.
“I have seen documentary evidence
that the reclamation service argued
with Secretary Ballinger against the
restoration order of which the Presi
dent speaks and that it reluctantly
made the recommendation only after
having been repeatedly ordered by
Secretary Ballinger to do so.”
Altogether, the little breeze may
turn out to be a storm in spite of all
Taft can do to allay it. And Pinchot
has the public strictly with him.

Union, with great sections of land for
school purposes. Recently the Fed
eral authorities endeavored to re
possess ’ itself of about 1,000,000
acres thus given to Montana. Has
Congress the right to control, without
authority of the State Legislature,
that which it once gave? It would
seem not. Legally, a deed of gift
can not be recalled at the behest of
the giver, though morally the bene
ficiary might often be under obliga
tion to surrender the gift. Montana,
from a struggling territory, needing
every encouragement, has become a
prosperous State. It might well co
operate with the Government toward
conservation of vast forest areas, but
obviously the Government could not
take away these lands without such
co-operation and consent.
As in the case of the California
school question, certain persons have
been confused relative to the status
serene, fat hand. It
is, from veiled an
tagonism, become
open warfare. Mr.
is of deep interest.
Congress dowered the
new State of Montana,
on its entrance to the
of the original thirteen States, and
those which were subsequently ad
mitted to the already formed Union.
There is, however, no such distinction
in Constitutional law. The newest
State becomes, upon admission, pos
sessed of identically as many rights
as the oldest.
Os course, if it be maintained that
the gift was for a specific purpose,
and the donor’s purpose is being de
feated by the donee, some very diffi
cult complications might develop,—
the burden of proof, however, rest
ing upon the Federal government.

and all who could get
there, in commemoration of the first
important steps in steam navigation.
To Denis Papin, a French physician,
is accorded the honor of being prob
ably the first man to navigate a boat
by steam, in 1707; while John Fitch
made the first American attempt to
apply steam to navigation, in 1785.
But Robert Fulton’s name will al
ways be associated with the practical
establishment of a regular steamboat
service between New York and Al
bany just a century ago. Models of
the “Clermont”, that first packet
boat, and of the Half Moon, the
small sailing vessel in which Henry
Hudson explored the river which
bears his name, three hundred years
ago, in quest of the “passage of In
dia”, have been interesting features
of the great water pageant.

Paris is taking a week's holiday
to celebrate the 100th anniversary
of the birth of Victor Hugo, in the
course of which a magnificent statue
of him, by Rodin, the great French
sculptor, w r as unveiled. Meantime,
our modern scouts of civilization,
Cook and Peary, have come in for
honors, only marred by the unfortu-*
nate controversy which still rages as
to which first —or which really—
reached the Pole. The military hero
has been somewhat in eclipse, which
is a welcome indication that the
world will not always save all its
bouquets for the victors in war, but
have a flower or two for all who de
serve it. * * * ♦
St. Louis is this week celebrating
its Centennial. A feature of this will
be the effort to get as many mayors
as possible to attend a conference for
the exchange of ideas relative to mu
nicipal government. Toronto, Can
ada, and St. Joseph, Mo., have been
the latest additions to the cities try
ing out the .“commission” plan and
a gathering of wide-awake mayors
would doubtless devote much time to
a study of this plan, with its various
modifications.

Loeb has done some
excellent service, in
what might be called
w r as to collect and has been no re
specter of persons in carrying out
that duty. The way he went after
the Sugar Trust for its stealings was
gratifying, and this constitutes one
instance of distinguished direct pub
lic service.
Keying his men to a more rigid
standard of vigilance against smug
gling has had some results apt to
cause Mr. Loeb some embarrassment,
however, as in the suit being brought
by Mrs. Azees Khayet against him.
The complaint made by this lady is
such as to cause the American to
hang his head in shame, and it is
scarcely probable that Mr. Loeb will
view' the matter otherwise than as
humiliating to himself as responsible
head of the Port. Although he alleges
that he has been in receipt of infor
mation that Mrs. Khayet had been
defrauding the government for years,
the fact that she and her three chil
dren were, upon suspicion, stripped
stark naked by customs officers and
subjected to the indignity of as rigid
a search as the Russian police could
make of a suspected Nihilist, will
more than outweigh any smuggling
she might have done. Nothing duti
able was found in the possession of
this lady or her children, and the
nervous shock they underwent, it is
alleged, has had most serious conse
quences for them all. Mr. Loeb must
assuredly regret the length to which
these underlings went.
This case, however, could, despite
its deplorable features, be termed an
indirect service. It shows the oper
ation of our beautiful tariff law in
one of its phases. It is all very well
to say that if people had not persist
ently tried to smuggle, no such
thing as breaking open trunks, de
tention, searching, and other humil
iations, would greet the returning
traveler: the fact that people will es
say to bring in dutiable articles free
only proves that in spite of every
specious protection plea, the individ
ual is for free trade whenever he
comes in contact with any of the dis
agreeables of the tariff. If the wives
and daughters of some high protec
tionists should happen to be stripped,
with as little ceremony as is shown
a Congo slave girl, their ideas might
undergo some modification. Any
thing that is wrong in principle, is
pretty apt to work out badly in ac
tual practice, and the Khayet inci
dent is but one of many tariff evils.

Victory, they say, rests with Spain
in its “war” with the Moorish tribes
men. Notwithstanding, 20,000 more
troops are being hurried there. Rout
ing the Riffs has been done at great
cost, and to obtain indemnity for this
war, Spain evidently proposes to
prosecute it to the point of involving
the Moroccan Government itself.
This will bring on more complica
tions. It is one thing to lick a few
thousand wild tribesmen, by pouring
overwhelming troops against them;
and another to become embroiled
