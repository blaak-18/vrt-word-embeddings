Fristoe, Ky., Feb. 19, 1900.
My dauhter much better. She is now starting on her third bottle. Wine of Cardul and Thedford's Black.
Drught have worked like magi with her. 1 have told some of my acquaintances of your medicines and tan
hea.-tily recommend themn to others. My daughter had both uterine and ovarian symptoms, side ach", backache,
and a headache now and then, espedally in the top of the head. But the ~ost stubborn pain was in the lekit side
at the lower edge of the ribs or three or four inches abve the upper part ol the groin, with soreness of the whole
abdomen during the period. ___________ Mrs. B. T. MILLIKEN.
Mothers whose daughters are nearing the age of womanhood should give a care to their con-.
dition. before they reach the stage of suffering Mrs. Miliken describes. Too often beautiful and
promisng girls become permanent invalids bause df a lack of proper caution at this crtical period of
their lives. The important thing for a girl just entering womanhood is to be started right Then a
healthy and happy life will foiow.
WINEorCARDUI
isb the great emmenagogue. It will regulate the menstrual flow. It will start the girl righLt. Every
mother should present her daughter with a bottle of Wine of Cardui and teach her to ry on it as a
friend. Girls who take an occasional dose of this pure Wine are strong and healthy. They avoid
much agony at torture. Mrs. Milliken's daughter was cured of all her suffcring and now she is a
utrong woman. Your daughter may be strong. There is no danger to fear at the coming of the
menstrual habit where Wine of Cardui is allowed to start healthy periods. Thousands of mothers
cndorse Wine of Cardul. AU druggists sell $1.00 bottles.

DON LUIS F. COREKA.
to pretty thoroughly inderstnnd, amt
the people will not perint much fur
ther delay. The stalkine ghost of tbh<
old Clayton-Bulwer treaty bas lonf
enougb impeded this great enterprisE
upon blch the American people havE
aft their hearts. In the opinion ol
niany statesmtnen of both parties, pasl
and present, tbhis treaty ought to havE
been abrogated years ago. as the rea
sons for its proniulgatiun long agc
censed to exist. The only reason foi
suoli a convention was that at the time
It was entered into in 1850 Great Brit
ain ciaimed certain rights in the Mos
quito Coast ly reason of a sort of pro
tectorate she had assumed over tbc
Mosquito Indians. Years ago this rath
er iudetinite protectorate camne to a
formal close. and Great Britain con
cluded a treaty with Nicaragua by
which she formally resigned whatever
rights she may have had in that quar
ter. Thus many American statesmen
and diplomatists. among them Secreta
ry Evarts and Secretary Blaine. dur
Ing their connection with the state de
partment. have held that there was no
occasion for the continuance of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty and that It
should be abrogated. Had this been
done there would have ,been no occa
ulon for the Hay-Pauncefote agree
ment. and the diplomatic complicatlons
which It brings Into the canal questlon
would have been obviated. We would
then have had to deal only with the
parties In Interest-Nicaragua and Cos
ta Rica-through portions of whose ter
ritory the canal will pass.
It may be recalled that the Clayton
Bulwer treaty was strongly denounced
by the senate committee on foreign re
lations In 1890. which was composed of
the following eminent statesmen: John
Sherman. George F. Edmunds, William
P. Frye, Willam M. Evarts, Joseph N.
Dolpb. John T. Morgan. Joseph E.
Brown, Henry B. Payne and James B.
Eustls, two of whom. Messrs. Frye
and Morgan. are memibers of tlihe pres
ent commiittee. After stating in vigor
ous ternims their premises and showing
how in 1802 Great Britain had deliher
ately violated the treaty. the cominittee
unanitnously concluded that "thle Unit
ed States is at present under no obli
gation, ineasured eitlier by the terms
of the convention. the principles of
public law or good morals. to refrain
from promoting. in any way ttuat it
may deeim best for lts just Inti-rst .
the coustruction of this canal without
ruzard to anything contained lin the
convention of 1S0."
Both Nicaragun and Costa Rica want
the canal almniost as imuchi as 4oes the
United States andi have Instructed their
ministers *o enter into treaty arranige
nimeuts for its construction tiiri'iogh
their territory. They desire, hlowever,
that all outside diplonratic comiplica
tions should first be dIispoised of. l ;ih
Minister Core and Uinister Calv
have lately expressed in very entlin
klastic terms tiheir sati'-faction over
te prospect that work is lik-ly to
begin before many montlis on the
treat enterprise. which tiny fully ree
