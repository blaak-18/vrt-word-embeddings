OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
ALL ABOUT SUGAR CANE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come,
trying for another prize. I live in the
country among the pigs and chickens.
We have a pet pig, and she is as cute
as can be. Her name is Bighead. We
have been grinding cane. Perhaps
some of the readers of the Post-Card
Club would like for me to tell about
it. We plant it in the spring and
about November it is cut down and
carried to the mill, where it is ground
into juice. It is then put into a
boiler and cooked into syrup and put
into bottles or barrels. I am going
to school to Miss Lena Kingsley, and
like to go very much. lam thirteen
years old, have golden hair, hazel
eyes and fair complexion.—Your little
friend, Blanche Young.
DUCK HUNTING IN TEXAS.
Dear Daddy Jim: —It is very cold
down here this morning. I expect it
is snowing where you live. We have
not had any frost down here yet, but
it looks like it is going to snow now.
We are going to can some tomatoes
today. Papa is building a chimney,
and he says it is very cold up on the
ladder. Papa went to Lake Tiocano,
one and a half miles from our house;
we children went with him, and we
saw hundreds of ducks. I wish you
could come down to see us. My papa
would take you out to kill some
ducks. Papa is out on the lake now,
hunting ducks; it is a fine time to
hunt them. Well, Daddy Jim, I will
close. —Good-bye, your little friend,
Lizzie Adams, Harlingen, Texas.
WANTS SOME HELP.
Dear Mr. Watson: —Will you kind
ly send me the name and address of
one boy or girl from Texas, New
Mexico, Georgia, lowa and Nebraska.
I want to write to each one separate
ly, asking them to send me, as soon
as possible, a description the cli
mate of the State in which they re
side. Our science teacher has asked
us to write to our friends asking for
descriptions of the climate of certain
places. In geography, we have been
studying climate and comparison of
climate of different places. I will
thank the persons sending me infor
mation, and I would be willing to
lend help to them or any other mem
ber of Daddy Jim’s club. I intend to
join Daddy Jim’s Club soon, and I
would like to know if we should
write on postal cards. Papa takes
both papers, and I am very interest
ed in them. Please send me the ad
dresses and names as soon as posssi
ble. —Yours truly, Rosa B. Greiner,
1348 Toronto St., Philadelphia, Pa.
FROM A TEXAS BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
boy, fourteen years of age. My papa
takes The Jeffersonian. I like to
read the children’s page. I saw some
riddles in the last paper, so I will
give some riddles: (1) It runs all
day and never gets tired, and stands
under the bed at night with its
tongue out. (2) As I went over a
heeple steeple I met a heap of peo
ple, micker nacker; some the color
of brown tobacco. Now the first one
that tells me what I mean by the two
riddles, I will send them a pretty
post-card. I live in the country. I
have two sisters, and two brothers.
There are five of us children in the
family. I go to school. My teacher
is Mr. Ross Covey. This is my first
attempt. I saw the riddles that little
Miss Annie May McNeill made. A
head, but no hair, is a pin, or a nail.
An eye, but no face, is a needle. —
Bascom House, Glen Rose, Texas.
AN ILLINOIS GIRL.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a little
country girl, eight years old. I have
one brother, and I go to school every
day I can. Our teacher’s name is
Mr. Green. My papa takes The Jes-
Bbe
fersonians and I like to read them.
The answer to Katie McDade’s riddle
is a cherry, I think.—From your lit
tle friend, Jennie Belle Searls, Route
6, Box 25, Casey, 111.
A WEST TEXAS BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l am a West
Texas boy, twelve years old. My
grandpa calls me “Tobe Spilkins,”
for the Buzz Saw Man, because
mamma would not name me Tom
Watson. Grandpa wants to know
what has become of the “Buzz Saw’’
Spilkins. He thinks Mr. Watson is
the grandest man in the world today.
He has my sister to read everything
in both Jeffersonians aloud to us.
Grandpa says he wants his grand
children to know what the Govern
ment is doing, and he knows the Jef
fersonians will tell us. I am in the
sixth grade.—Walton Whitaker, Rt.
1, Hamlin, Texas.
WHAT SANTA CLAUS BROUGHT.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here I come
again. I guess my first letter found
the waste-basket, as I didn’t see it
in print; though it might have been
in the paper that we didn’t get, as
we missed one. I received your card;
many thanks for it, I appreciate it
very much. lam enjoying vacation
very well. We will start to school
Monday. We have thirty-three pu
pils in our room. We have in the
whole school about nine hundred.
Well, Christmas has come and gone.
Santa Claus brought me a pretty
locket and some other nice things.
Good-bye; best wishes to your little
readers, and much love to Daddy
Jim.—Your little friend, Verna
Crane, Americus, Ga.
A CARD FOR A RIDDLE.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
little Georgia girl to join your haopy
band. My papa takes The Jefferson
ian, and I enjoy reading the letters
from the little boys and girls very
much. I am a little girl, thirteen
years old; my birthday will be the
15th of April; I will be fourteen
years old. I sure would appreciate
a present. I am going to school
every day I can. I am in the fifth
grade and like my studies. My papa
is a farmer; he raises cotton, corn,
potatoes, and sugar cane. I help my
papa on the farm, and think it’s no
disgrace. I have five brothers and
three sisters; there are ten in the
family. Let me ask you some rid
dles: Go all over the house and sit
up in the corner at night—to every
one who answers this riddle I will
send you a pretty post-card. Daddy
