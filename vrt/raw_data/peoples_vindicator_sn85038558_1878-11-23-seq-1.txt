eve'r dteclaredi its ote ill atij, rnment
the members quietly dispersed to
their homes. Mr. Blunt going to his
home was inlnorined that the same
armed amob was huntinug him. Ile
had, thereform'e, at once his d welling, a
neat tWo story frame building in the
midst of' white, neighbors, closedi up,
the doors and windows fastened and
himself prepared to stand the siege
he felt sure from past experience a
Natchitochesa Democratic mobl would
occasion.
A few minutes afterwards the mob
arrived in front of the house. They
demanded admission. This was, of
course, refused. They at once then,
proceeded to batter down the doors
and windows; numnLeting some two
hundred and fifty men, this was soon
accomplished. Meanwhile Mr. Blunt,
by the frantic entreaties of his wife
and daughter, the latter a young lady
in her teens, was gotten to secrete
himself above the teester of his bed,
in the ceiling of his sleeping roorm
The mob entered, broke into armoirs,
bureaus, closets, and safes; ransacked
and mutilated all the furniture; one
of the leaders, Judge Chaplin, took
the keys and purse of Mrs. Blunt, all
the money in the house not on her
husband's person, and after vainly
searching each room, finally retired
with Mrs. Blunt and her daughter as
prisoners, to be carried to the court
house and jail. From some informa
tion gained, however, before getting
out of the yard, the mob returned
and made another search for Mr.
Blunt. They sought at once his hi
ding place above the bed, and one of
them thrusting tp his Winchester
rifle had it stepped on and snatched
from his hands. Mr. Blunt was then
ordered to surrender. This he re
fused. 'Thongh a Baptist preacher
and.a coldored man, it was known that
ie . was unquestionably brave and a
good shot. After some parleying,
each of the gang by their leader's
ditebtion was'then asked and a vote
taken as to whether, on Blunt's sur
render, they would refrain from in
juring a hair of his head. They all
agreed, yes. Mr. Blunt then came
do*ti into the mob. - He found them
all composed of "best" citizens. Not
a poor white man among them, ex
cept "Jack" Gilchrist. The leader
was one Joseph Canningham. "Bill"
Levy, lawyer 'Jack, Tucker and two
sons, 'Cosgtmove, and the Hertzogs,
uncle and nephew, with many others,
participated. Except one Caspari,
net's ' Heobrew' doing business in the
town, was of the mob. Mrs. Blunt
and step-daughter, and sister, and
Mirs. Paris, a.. lady guest, were
;veie then placed in custody and pro
ceeded with tb the jail. Just before
thbis, Mayor: Dranguet" atrived when
the mob wi 'bvreakiog: up the furni-.
tare and robbing 'Mrs. Blunt, and
that otielahi'xcitedit said: "Gen
tlieMen,:I approve of every act you
now.do. .' Ihold youg blameless." Mr.
Blant also :noeticed as present, Judge
NP ,en the Distniet- Judge. Hem
nfed' between:' two of his guards, Mr.
Bfnt -m*ainarched to the courthouse.
heiI thorp, hi 1ri~ie was summoned,
ap i'was ekolt. tliat if he had any
tloi~itt- 'gve herl he could do so.
Taking his.poiket-book, .a gold pen
holder4 and ,keys from his pockets,
Mr..,Blunt handed them over to his
hbtimate1 lhe, :weeping, 'as be
sough~'t'b leave him in the' hands of
%Qod; and' inR custody of these cruel
in n.' Aiilt ten o'clock at night
Cl"ifirglimh in muich excitement,
enters fti .,room, and said: "The
'aiggera' areinarching on the town to
rescue Blant3p before he shall be giv
en--up, he' must be killed." Mr.
Blunt recalled to their minds their
pledges as to his safety. Then said
Cunninglia,.:'tmake the 'niggers' go
home." Mr. Blunt said he knew noth
inogof.beir.purpose. lie was a. pris
oner.iR their hands,, but if they would
permit him to go, he would tell them
of his captors pledges, and get them
to 'return home. That he would
pledge hierself to return again to
theii custody. .This Cunningham re
fused. 'W'ished somebody to be sent
by Blunt. Finally, a young colored
mian named James Armstrong went,
and got the drowd of colored people
to return to: their, homes.' On Arm
strong coming back he was met by a
white rfflohn, 'and brained' from his
hiotad'ith the breech"' of a musket.
Picked,. pi senseless he could only
ejaculate,, on reviving, "I went to do
your bidding and ain nearly killed."
Subsequently Mr.' Blunt's wife and
Mfts. Parid went ann' quieted another
crwd of colored ecititens. At a half
hour after gnidnighl the gqard at the
courthoose.cane to Mr. Blast and
skid he mirst leave the tow'n. liift~

L&wi~Ng it'tlogethe* five minutes at ,
hbb5 Then mounted on his horse,
a fasj uhipal, and between his cap
n, o, was ea.mryed from. the towu.
After riding a mile or so, the corn
Vhia t alted. 'TliM d esa pulled a

I hen shook iun us \ it h Blunt and
bade him "aTh i-hi ." Their horses
lheads turi.l dalii viry s~.oo the
soun(h of their goink became faint
and were lost.
Mr. Blunt went down the lane where
he was left, very swiftly on his fleet
horse, struck the road and all at once
a presentment of evil st iking him. he
reigned up his good steed, and list
ening, he heard the sound of a horse's
feet. "Quit the road" seemed to be
whispered to hiu,. lie wheeled his
Ihorse involuntarily and the animal
went into the woods. Flamiliar with
the entire country, he made his way
easily through the woods. Later on
lie learned that not more t fan three
hundred yards from where he quitted
the road, T. Wheeler, a noted despo
rado, bulldozer, from Coushatta, laid
in wait on the road for Blunt's dis
patch, with twenty-live men. Mr.
Blunnt rode until fonr o'clock in the
morning, wlhen comling to a friend's
house, his horse was secreted, and
the fugitive remained in safely until
night, when his trip was resumed.
Ihe rode thus solme two hundred
miles until he reached the neighbor
hood of Alexandria. Here he was
joined by his young friend Lewis, a
school teacher of Natchitoches, to
whom the brave clergyman had sent
word on the first morning of his es
cape. Diuring the route and until he
ar ived in a neighborhood to take the
boat for our city, Mr. Blunt felt for
cibly the providential interference in
his behalf of the Lord. Hie protect
ed him in the presence of his ene
inies. Thrice he, by Providence only,
was saved from tailing into the hands
of ambushed gangs -prepared to slay
him.
Before leaving the custody of the
Natchitoches Whito League, Joseph
Cunningham, their leader, told Blunt,
"you are not only controlling the
negroes, but duping white men." This
was an allusion to the attitude of the
poorer whites towards the Democra
cy, in that the passage of a hog
law, impounding and confiscating
swine, and a stock law, obliging
the poor people to keep their an
imals away from pasturage, had
made naturally this class opposed to I
the Democratic rule. As Mr. Blunt
had been the State Senator, and was
besides generally known and respect
ed, it was quite natural for these 1
people to talk with and endeavor to
receive such advice about their com
mon grievances as he could give.
Arrived here, Mr. Blunt in his per
son showi the marks - of the terrible
ordeal through which hlie has passed.
In appearance of a tall and shapely
presence, with a usually clear olive
complexion, he is browned by ex
posure to the sun in the swamps of l
Natchitoches and Rapides to the cop
perish tinge of a wild Indian.
Roughened as he has been by merci
less treatment, he is not yet alto
gether cast down. A man with a
stronug religion bias, having a fer
vent faith in the omnipotence and
justice of God, he rejoices in his
escape humbly and devoutly as a
God fearing Ohristian.
We are confident that Christian
men and women everywhere in our
land, apart from their love of coun
try and the free institutions of

STEWART'S GRAVE.
ITS DESECRATION BY VANDALS.
The Body of the Late Mlillionaire Stolen
From the Tomb,
HOPES OF A REWARD BELIEVED TO BE
THE OBJECT OF THIE RE5URRECTIONISTS.
[Cincinnati Enquirer.]
New York, November 7.-The bo. I
dy of A. T. Stewart was stolen from
its grave in St. Mark's Church-yard,
in this city, last night or some time
this morning, and the perpetrators of
the outrage have not yet been dis-.
covered
The report at first seemed so in
credible that persons who were told
of the rumor laughed and refused to
give it apy attention. When, how
ever, it was no longer possible
doubt the truth of the story wt
deepest indignation was expn. to

7th of tents of the vault, but in
get occasion the ruffiaos werelo(
d before they had achieved be
eir purpose, and fled before they t
bad time to remove the great stone ti
which covers the mouth of the vault.
After this alarm a watchman was em* th
ployed to watch the grave, but was gr
not informed of the exact nature of
his duties. His instructions were le
simply toprevent any persons from ii
entering the church-yard or meddling t
with the church property. Last Mon- c
day this man was relieved from duty, i
as it was thought that there was no
further need of his services. i
As a further precaution against any t
attempt to rob the grave the simple a
tablet which marked the opening to j
the vault was put in another place, i
but tlhis device did not for an instant '
deceive the robbers, who were evi- t1
dently perfectly well aware of the '
exact spot beneath whic the varlt a
The letter "B,' wri'ten is bl" e pme n
il,was found a uoOie of t1ir 'pf i
, " arozund the church-yard, and two
ki pieces of paper were attached to an
Sother post. It is said that a line
I drawn fronu tlhe letter '"B" to the
ll pieces of paper crosses the vault,
id while a second line drawn to the first
es fromt a tree on the Second avenue
Hs side of the yard intersects the first
ut line at the exact spot where the open
ing of the vault lies beneath the turf.
I 1n order to show how systematical
lt y the robbers went to work, and
with what certainty and rapidity they
Sworked, it will be well to describe
the vault. This is a chamber ten
leet deep, the opening to which is
be covered by three large stones meas
Stiuring in all four feet six inches. In
al the other above these stones was
th earth to the depth of three feet, coy
ered with turf which was level with
the rest of the surface of the church
Syard. There was, therefore, in the
ul absence of the tablet removed by or
u der of Judge Hilton no outward in
id dication of the vault's position, and
the ease with which the opening
was discovered by the depredators
e proves that their plans had been per
, fected with the utmost care.
The robbers, who were probably
til five or six in number, having enter
d ed the church-yard, proceeded to re
m( tuove the earth from the opening to
r- the vault. This was soon acomplish
ed by the aid of a shovel, an ordinary
Sire-shovel, which, with a dark lan
tern, they left behind them. They
then pried up one of the stones cov
_ ering the opening, thus making an
opening just large enough to permit
the entrance of two men simultane
ously. There were several coffins in
n the vault, but the robbers do not ap
pear to have hesitated in choosing
the right one. The outer casing of
cedar was easily broken, and the
ý' second or leaden coffin was ripped
open, apparently with a large knife.
There then remained the oaken, coffin,
which was also broken open. The
h body was then taken out and placed
in some sort of sack, lifted up towards
0 the opening, where there were prob
is ably other hands to receive it, and
carried to the iron raillings around
the church yard. The weight of the
body was not very great, but it is
g still a question how it was passed
g over the railings. The work was
B performed somehow, for all the gates
d were locked, and the body was then
o probably put into a wagon and driven
t quietly away.
It is worthy of notice that no-foot
marks were found in the church-yard,
although the surface was soft after
the fall of rain and snow last eve
ning. It is therefore, surmised that
the robbers stepped from grave-stone
to grave-stone, and thus made their
exit either on Stuyvesant or Eleventh
street.
Mr. Hamill, the sexton of the
e church, who has (most freely given
whatever information he possessed on
the subject, told your correspondent
that, in his opinion, the dead body of
Mr. Stewart still retained much of
its old form. Decomposed it certain
ly was, for the stench in the vault
a this morning was so horrible as to
overpower persons not accustomed to
d grave-. ard odors. It is also remark
ed that there is in the bottom of the
coffiu a quantity of black, sticky mat
ter, which isonly observable in cases
of advanced decomposition. Mr.
r Hamill, however, thin' Lhat as the
coffin was air-tight t,% body was so
far preserved that it would be easy
enough to remove it, although the
task must have been an extremely
n unpleasant one. rThe police, in
deed, when they firbt examined the
k vault, expressed the opinion that'
the robbers must have had experience
Sin dissecting-rooms, or they would
never have been able to endure so
horrible an atmosphere. The motive
of the crime is generally thought to
be the reward which the robbers be
lieved will be offered for the return of
the body. If this is the case, they are
likely to be grievously disappointed,
for Mr. Hamill said this morning that
II Judge Hilton sail to him that he
would not offer one dollar reward. If
the body has been stolen with the
a view of extortion, the thieves are
s. likely to find themselves in a very
difficult prdicament. The police say
that they will be unable either to
keep the body or get ritd of it. They
- canmooteu€ke it out of the city or seP
Sit in the city, and their onla;
source will be to bury it somerulie
e and yet the robery was evithe sil
f or present gain, for tita, whlOb,
Snothing except th6e1O purposes of
ver-plate nponae value of it is
- was probabJnall a sum to induee
Id identifcilo great a risk.
Solynlmill is of the opinion that
J. 'ien worked while lying down on
Seir stomachs, as the shovel with
which the earth was removed was
too small for a man to use while stand-'
-ing upright. The news of the dse-e
oration of the grave spread very rap
idly, and a number of idlers eoon
gled around the church-lard al
though there .~wasi olntely noth
ing to be seemo The gates were -all
locked, and the, onily.~siitfacti¶a to
be obtained was from the contempla
tion of a tree standing near a' hole in
the ground.
Many of the bystanders said that
they were only astonished that the
grave had not been robbed before.
The inner coffin, which the robbers
left behind, was made of English oak,
lined and elaborately quilted withi
the most expensive satin, the ontside
covered with LyOns velvet and or
namented arond the border with
gold-plated mounting, Long ezten
