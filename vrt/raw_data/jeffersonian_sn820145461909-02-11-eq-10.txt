THE MISSENT VALENTINE.

all sweetness and affability, she was
freezing haughtiness or insolent dis
dain. I sat on the jagged rocks of
jealousy and suspense. I did not know’
what time I might tumble into the
abyss of hopeless wretchedness by
having her marry some one of the
fools she was flirting with. In this
unhappy state of ihind Saint Valen
tine’s Day arrived. A brilliant idea
struck me. I could end my misery 7 ,
and take my revenge at the Same
time. I had what I was pleased to
call a poetic talent. With the sober
sense of thirty-five years I may say
I was unhappily vain of it. I would
write Miss Delia Mason a declara
tion of my real sentiments. I would
pour out my youthful passion for her
so eloquently that she would be anx
ious to marry me for my genius. You
needn’t laugh. I am not the only
fool the wobld'has produced, nor the
only youth—with good intentions—
that has been the victim of a flirt. I
would send my love effusion to Miss
Mason under cover of St. Valentine’s
day. If she scornfully rejected it —
it could pass as a valentine—noth
ing more. If she accepted it in the
sincerity in which I intended it, I
would be in glory. I satisfied myself
with my poetry for Miss Mason, and
then proceeded to write a very dis
similar one to Miss Hunt. I still have

and took out a letter which he handed
to me. On the cover was the address
Miss Delia Mason. On the inside
were tlie following lines written in
a boyish hand that in no way resem

known in business circles:
“ ‘Delia—spinster—hapless maid!
Spying, tattling, ancient jade;
Mischief-making, sharp nosed shrew,
Naught’s too mean for you to do.
false of teeth, and false of hair,
Parody of all that’s fair;
Prying, peeking, nosing ’round.
Listening at the slightest sound.
Liivy hate —for youth you feel,
Seek its harm with frantic zeal;
Fortune, flouted crook-nosed jade, •
Men despise you, poor old maid.’

state, I suppose—l got that poetry
into Miso Mason’s envelope. It came
back to me that same day with her
compliments. She pretended to think
I had intended it for her. I was
just fool enough to try to explain. I
could not understand that Miss Ma
son was that kind of a flirt that
draws a man on until he wants to talk
love and she doesn’t want to listen
to it. She was a shrewd young wo
man —was Miss Mason. She was on
to a safe game of hearts. To add to
my misery Miss Hunt showed my
soft out-pouring of love and deathless
passion—which she had received—to
the boarders. They all pretended to
believe that 1 had made no mistake.
One line of it I shalFnever forget. It
was, ‘lf you could read this heart of
mine! ’
“‘Old Griggs was the first one I
heard quote it. He placed his pudgy,
old fist on his stomach, and rolling
his eyes until they looked like a pick
led mackerel’s, repeated it in a man
ner that made me feel murderous.
“After that I never entered the
house that some one of the boarders
did not have it over. Still, I was
plucky enough not to give up the
fight. I wrote Miss Mason a letter,
in which I did Miss Hunt ample jus
tice. She wrote back that she might
forgive the blunder I had made —
but never, never, while reason re
mained, could she forgive me the
perpetration of such poetry. I had
not recovered from the shock of that
blow to my vanity. when old Griggs
began to suggest to Miss Hunt that
she use (he letter I had sent her as
testimony in a breach of promise case,
lhat was the last. I fled the house
and resigned my position in the store
where I was employed.
“1 had a whole lot of bad luck
after that. Finally, in seeking em
ployment, in a most desperate chance.
I unburdened my tale of mishaps to
a prosperous business man. He took
an awful lot of interest in me after
that. It seems he had been in just
such a scrape himself when he was
young and tender, and he could sym
pathize with me. His assistance was
the beginning of my present pros
perity. I gave up poetry, but I am
not sure that tlie world did not lose
a genius in my early disappoint
ment. ’ ’
