CROPS FORCE ISSUE.
One of the important questions
which Secretary of the Treasury Mc-
Veagh is said to have discussed yes
terday with the President at Bever
ly was how to provide the money with
which to move the crops of the coun
try this fall. It is an annually return
ing question, but this year it is more
than usually interesting, because it
involves something of a fight be
tween the national banks and the
Treasury Department.
The banks are trying to force the
Department to bear all of the ex
pense of furnishing the currency

needed for crop-moving purposes.
Every fall there is a tremendous de
mand on the banks for money to get
the wheat, corn, oats, etc., to mar
ket, and heretofore the Treasury has
come to their assistance by giving
them deposits of public money, which
could be returned after the rush was
over. But the department is not
in a position this year to give the
banks help in this way to the extent
desired. The question is, therefore,
How is the money to be supplied?
and it is a problem that is daily be
coming more pressing.
Under the emergency currency
law the national banks can issue
currency up to the amount of $500,-
000,000 to meet just such occasions
as these. But they would be re
quired to deposit bonds with the
Treasury as security for the amount
of currency issued and the transac
tion would involve some expense to
each bank. The currency is already
printed and could be issued upon ap
plication without delay.
But the banks think they know a
trick better than that. Instead of
attempting to take out the emergen
cy currency authorized by law, they
are endeavoring to create such a sit
uation as will compel Secretary Mc-
Veagh to issue Treasury certificates
of indebtedness, which pay 3 per
cent, interest. They want the De
partment to issue about $100,000,-
000 of these certificates.
The banks could deposit these and
issue circulation against them the
same as against government bonds,
and during the year they were out
standing they would be earning that
3 per cent., whereas the emergency
currency would, of course, pay no in
est at all. The transaction would
cost the government $3,000,000 in
interest, and would save the banks
practically all expense.
There is no way of compelling the
banks to take out emergency curren
cy, and if they persist in their pres
ent attitude, the chances are there
will be a serious money stringency
within the next month or two, which
the Treasury will have to relieve in
some fashion.
A STYLISH PLAITED SKIRT
MODEL.
8582 Ladies’ Gored Skirt with Plaited
Sections.
This model is especially desirable,
as it embodies two most important
features of this season’s newest
skirts, namely, the close fitting upper
part, and the fullness given by the
plaits. The skirt consists of four
plain gores, joined to four other
gores that have a plaited section in
serted at the lower part of each. Pop
lin, mohair, cheviot or satin finished
cloth may be used for this model.
The pattern is cut in five sizes, 22, 24,
26, 28, 30 inches waist measure. It
requires yards of 50-inch mate
rial for the 24-inch size. A pattern
of this illustration mailed to any ad
dress on receipt of 10 cents in stamps
or silver.

The situation is bothering Secre
tary McVeagh to some extent, and
he went to Beverly more to talk this
matter over with the President than
to report his difficulty in finding tar
iff experts.—Washington (D. C.)
Herald.
The indications still are for a rec
ord crop of corn in the country. It
will in all probability reach and may
succeed 3,000,000,000 bushels. Not
withstanding this enormous promise
of yield the price of corn still keeps
firm in the market and it would ap
pear therefore as though it was im
possible to grow more of this crop
than the market will take care of.
Last year very little was exported
and yet stocks are not large. The
problem of providing meat for our
population of nearly 100,000,000
people seems to make the size of the
corn crop, if only it is large enough,
a matter of small moment as affect
ing the price. The stock feeders
must have it as the market must
have the meat, and the public pays
the bill.—Southern Planter.

When filled with signatures return
to the United States Monetary
League, Joseph N. Stephens, Nation
al Secretary, 634 17th St., Denver,
Colo.
To the President of the United States
and Members of the Senate and
House of Representatives:
We, the undersigned electors and
citizens respectfully represent:
That we view with alarm the efforts
that are being made to retire the
$346,000,000 of United States notes,
commonly called greenbacks; and to
melt into bullion the 600,000,000
of silver dollars now in circulation in
the United States. These are now
performing the function of a circu
lating medium and there is no jus
tification for their retirement.
The substitution of a bank curren
cy therefor would be injurious to
the nation, because it would place
within the hands of the banking
classes the power to contract and ex
pand the medium by which payments
are made and by which values are
determined. The exercise of such a
power by any one class is bound to
be detrimental to the interests of the
masses;
Therefore, we respectfully urge:
First: That the $346,000,000 in
greenbacks shall not be destroyed.
Second: That the silver dollar be
not elimenated from coinage and use,
but the increasing demands of com
merce for a circulating medium be
supplied by increased coinage of both
gold and silver and the issuance of
gold and silver certificates thereon.
Ed. Comment: We publish the
above with pleasure, hope that it will
carry many signatures to Brother
Stephens. T. E. W.
