We are icinearer out oif debl t nowy
than ever before, and the great fn- I
tire has in store for 1;,, :an era of
prosperity which is pleasing even to 11
contemplate. "
With such .i climate, soil and la- Io
billr; with sch prodetions and such) t
profits arising therefloml, it is well to
(o1nsider what investments we will helit
compelled to make with the Sarilusi
capital nrisin;l nceý sarially as a t
profit )po1n o Tn gricultural plrslits.
Before the war slaves were the stani- it'
ing plrchase, in which not only our
prolilts, bt our credit was exhaustled ti
liappily for our lasting proSp(rity. ic
that c0ri1se has been removed, a1nd ti1
our means mast lhe deposited in other, i
andt in the end hbetter securities. a
We lack yet two elements of wealth ali
which must be supplied by our own l t
exertions ; RaIlroads and Manufacto- In
ries! It is being rapidly proven by c1
the stern logic of events, that the a
system of latitudinal artificial devel- a
opment is at variance with nature, so
far as this country is concerned at V
least. Our greatest rivers, thlose a
cheap modes of transportation, are
longitudinal, and no artificial chan
nels can be constilcted to draw from
them cereals which they were created
to transport. Thile Inlate railroadi
troubles have a remote and striking I
cause in this very fact, when great
corporaitions madly endeavored to 1
drag the carrying trade by artificial
means from the Mississippi tiver,
Our markets are South, foir there we I
meet the world with its goods ito ex
change foir our productions, it is the I
nearest to ocean transportation, and1
therefore the clheapest, hence larger
profits awaits us froom sales made
there. Railroands constructed longi
tudinally to aid in carry ing our pro
dnetonls to the nearest water travel,
is the correct theory, anid with suchd
latitudinal rioands as tend to bring
transportation to, not draw it from
our longitudinal rivers, are those
in which capital shoulld he invested.
Manufactories in the South are as
yet in their infancy, still it has been
demonstrated that cotton can lie
manufactured into yarns anti clothlls so
cheaply as to drive the Northern
manufactured allrticles from all markl
ets where we come in competition
with them. Besides this, the profits
of the new and ilcleaseid value com
municated to the raw material by its
manufacture into articles for ready
consumption will inure to us at home,
instead of those abroad. In other
words, we approach nearer, by a long
stride, columanding and holding the
qross values thlls l'oduced, while
now, we have but the ct1er v'tlue as
our total income.
We have by nature the agrlcultr'al
zone in which to supply the necessa
ry demands of the world in a raw
state, but by the judicious invest
ment of our aecimlated gains, in
railroads and factoi ies, we zidd com
mercial and manufacturing industries
to that of our now splendid and pros
perots agricultural industry.
While the North is bankrupt and
amid the throes of mighty ruin;
while it lies exhausted and impover
ished from an attempt, both cruel and
despicable, to ruin us, the South
mnarches on to prosperity and wealth,
like the young giant. While mobs
destroy ploierty and starving labor
dimolishes the very means of its
susttla.nc;i while law is suspended

Radical Lies.
S egro politicians of this parish are, wi
as they ate elsewhere, a standing ;I
menace to peace and prosperity. We t'
uInderstan:d that the negroes have ri
been excited to the highest pitch by
being told that the "Democratic po
lice jury had passed a law under
which no negro or poor white man
could own hogs or cattle unless lhe
owned land.'' Such report ot course to
, is a lie, circulated for the purpose of fi
. exciting the negro's apprehension and p
,s keeping alive his unfounded and un- w
4 just fears. It is the old story of the
it "rcturn to slavery" if the Democrats
', got in power, told in another way.
Blunt, it seems, is the fellow who p
c- is doing this foul work andi he is c
at well qualified therefor. However, he c
I lhand better stop it, for the reason it
will do no good to him or his in the a
e- end. n
We cannot imagine why the col- r
e ored people will cling to this fellow I
s who has done them more harm than e
,t. they can imagine. He has deceived r
n- them grossly in the past ; heo has en- I
hg deavored to estrange the white and 1
re black man, and so long as he rules r
ug the negro and uses him, just so long
nt will the whites remain in solid pha- I
lie lanx to resist him. 1
o0 If Blunt and his circuit politicians
For have not had enough, they can be
on fully accommodated next year, or
[t, before.
The Columnbia herald m;aan has ino just
cause to designate the VINxDtcATronl as a
ld "blackguard sheet," and we suppose it
atl the better part of valor to keep clear
nt (which we shall do) of the rihald staff
is he uses as decent (F) English, in reply to
ill our strictures upon al article in the

t Shreveport possesses great natural
e advantages, andl her enterprising
merchants have labored hard to ad
- vance her prosperity. Fine business,
v public and private buildings greet the
n eye at every turn, and modern conve
d niences, gas, street cars, &c., have
i- been erected in order to call trade
(1 and population to the city. Utnfortu- t
is nato circumstances, over which the
g enterprising citizens of that city had
t- no control, have kept Shreveport back, t
but we feel assured that their thrift
is and enterprise will be fully rewarded t
me in the future.
)I North Louisiana is interested in
Shreveport as a commercial mart, and
s should, from pure interest, do all it
could to build up a competition city
near at home.
ar Our merchants, who desire some
of the cash business this fall, would
consult their interest by liberally
ni patronizing the VINDICATOrI. Notlh

is pecially in a paper that visits more

will draw custom because you are
