Attakapas &n'tinel, St. Martin's par
ish, hoists the name of Louis A. Wiltz,
Of Orleans, for Governor; speaks in
very flatoring terms of the crops gen
cverally and of corn in particular,
which it says is the "largest ever
grown" in the parish. Democratic
aid Conservmtire club are organ.
izing throughout the parish uhd the
people are enthusiastic.
Democrat, Rapides parish, says
that the Radicals need not expect to
be ieased by the Democratic-Con
servative party of that parish at the
expense of priuciple-"that's played,"t
and the whites of the parish as well
as one third the blacks intend to vote
the Democratic ticket.
Sentinel, Lafourche parish, speaks
in glowing terms of F. S. Coode as I
the proper person for Governor on
the Democratic ticket. Crops are in
tne condition.
Courier, St. Landry prarish, notice
with glatification the general favor
with which Dr. Jno. A. Taylor's name 1
is received in connection with the
lomination for the office of State
Auditor. Supreme court is now in
session at Opelousas attended by a
large number of the legal fraternity.
From the tone of the Courier we
would judge that the Democrats are
still divided in that parish.
Times, Caddo parish, says crops are
in good condition and the political
outlook at present calm with great
hope of snccess.
Caddo has hitherto been a strong
Democratic parish and we see inoth
ing to change it frIom the fold save
the ierttness of its people and the
idiocracy of those that would follow
off the teachings of the incongruous,
contradictory and ridiculous letter of
Leonard's. We hope, for the intellih
gence of that parish, that none will
be so ridiculously insane as to do so.
-[Ed.
It is reported that death war
rants of the negroes now in our
jail, and sentenced at last term of
the District Court some six
month since, have been signed by
Kellogg, and the execution of
these criminal will take place in a
short time.
The day for compromise with
corruption and affilliation with
thieve, has gone by. On all ques
tiorts of administrative reform,
our Convention must give forth no
uncertain sound, and the candi
dates SatM be taken from the thick of
the fight-not the fence.
A Mass Meeting of the Demo
cratic-Conservative citizens of

Let every man in every ward

this meeting.
The spirit of "bill-sticking" Ihas
seized upon our hotel keepers to such

WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1876. 1
Champion American Comic Paper! '
t
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up- t
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical pape(r of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
the pnublic, it was changed to a fortnight- e
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up a
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than c
before, and was recognized as tht ablest
and brightest of itsclass. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats F
weekly! It has literally grown into its E
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be- a
ing the first successful weekly humorous o
paper ever published in this country. t
Among the artists especially engaged t
to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins, I
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels, e
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several r
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departmeuts Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and t
unapproachable. At least one first-class I
serial story will always be/found in its
pages, by the best humtorous, satirical, I
and character writers in the United r
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed. I
Wild Oats will be first-class in every I
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.

READ THIS :
Scott Town, Lawrence County, Ohio.
Messrs. KENNEDY & CO.-Dear Sirs: At this late hour I will inform you of the
great benietit I received from the use of Dr. Radeliffs Great Remedy, Seven Seals
or Golden Wonder, after being contined to my bed for eight years with a complica
tion of diseases,Uviz: Dyspepsia, Bronchitis,. Palpitation of the Heart, Pain in the
Right Side, with General l)ebility, for which I tried the skill of our home physi
cians, also a doctor of New York City, and two of Pittsburgh, and one in the
northern part of Ohio. Took enough patent medicines to swim in-all to no par
pose. At length I was induced to try Dr. R:dclitrs Seven Seals or Golden Wonder.
I sent and got six fifty cent bottles, and before using it all found myselfable to
travel in a huggy. Took the agency for its sale last April, four uonths ago, and
have tpld thirteen gross, or 1,872 bottles, up to this date, A ,gast 20th, 1872, and
expeer ma the growing demand to sell ten thousanrd (10,000) bottles in the inext
year. :eutlemen, if you think this worth using you can do so, as I am generally
known over three counties as a man of great alliction.
Yours Respectfdully, II. J. DARLING.

A REMEDY FOR HAIlRD TIMES. TRY IT.
FOR THIS GREAT REMEDY WE WISH YOU TO ACT AS OUR AGENT.
Dear Sir:-The albove fully explains the articles we wish to sell. This business
is honorable, and by Ibeing energetic, will pay you well. It is our desire to ap
point an agent in every county in all parts of the United States alnd Canada, grant
nig to each the exclusive right to sell every bottle sold in the county. Should you
accept the agency for one or more counties, yon shall have the exclusive right to
sell every bottle sold in your county, as long as you continue to act as our agent,
and all ordemrs which we may receive from your territory shall be tarned over to
yoar account.
- This Wonderful Remedy, Seven Se:ds or Golden Wonder, sells rapidly in the
hands of the right kind of men, and we want none other. Now if you think you
are the man for the work, forward your order, name your county, andl go to work;
you can sell a gross in a few days, without a dloubt. We have one aman who buys
on an average three gross per week, and his orders are increasing rapidly, and he
has a small county, (Berks Co., Pa.) He writes that he expects to sell one gross
I per dlay, at retail, the coming season, not counting wholesale. You have the priv
Silege of selling wholesale or retail, or putting it on commission with druggists, or
selling by sub-agents. This business is worth the attention of good men and men
of capital. Should you make but reasomable wages-say $100 per month for the
firat three months (many make more)-you would nevertheless be establishiug a
business that would pay you largely in the end.
Agentis are doing better with our Remedy than saything else tlihey ever took
hodof. Why is this f Blecause the Remedy does just as we say, and our agente
I can warrant every bottle. No cure, no pay. Knowing that we muake all leoses
* good, should they be called on to redeem a bottle, agents run no risk of loes.
