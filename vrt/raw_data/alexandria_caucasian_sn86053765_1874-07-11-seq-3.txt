Notwithstanding the publicity,
which hai recently been obtained
by the Patrons of Husbandry, not
a little confaslon and miaaiprelien
siou exists not only in the public
generally, bat even among Patrons
themselves, astotbepreeiee objects
and purposes of the order» and the
means by Which their aims are 'ex
ecuted. The sudden rise of the Or
1 der, the secrecy which seemed to
envelope its movements, and the
astonishing résulta which have fol
lowed its organisation, throughout
the West especially—have excited
in an unusnal degree the interest
of the Agricultural population in
other sections of the country—and
in so doing have created in some
respects a mistaken and exaggera
ted idea of the objects of the order,
and of its capacity to execute the,
reformatory measures, which it as
signs as its special and peculiar
task. Many have supposed that
the order possessed some secret, or
Special power, and that its simple
presence, or introduction in any
community would act as a sovereign
panacea for all the ills, from which
its members suffered. The simple
establishment of the Grange, aud a
knowledge of its practical workings
must of course, effectually remove
all such erroneous impressions—but
according to a natural action of the
human mind—the re-action, when
the interest, and expectation has
been so great, must be as unfavor
able as the first impressions were
exaggerated and erroneous.
DisappoiriHient at first ensues,
and then doubt and suspicion as to
the possession of any merit or abil
ity to lftelp you, begins to creep in
to, and take possession of your
. mind. The sturdy»plauter battling
with all the renl difficulties of his
ö situation, carrying a load of care
and annoyance that would be too
much for the patience of historic
Job—reluctantly leaves his work
to attend the meetings of his
Grange. He goes with the hope of
discovering some means by which
' the real practical difficulties of his
situation may be overcome or alle
viated He finds a formal and
complicated ceremonial, containing
may beautiful and well expressed
thoughts—and inculcating a high
moral code. But. what good does
this do him 1 What relief docs it
' afford him lioin his many and* près
sing difficulties. Is it not nonsense,
is it not trifling—for a maiQstrug
glii»K for an existence to neglect his
work to be present simply at so
idl o e a ceremony I Such sentiments,
if must be confessed, might not ap
pear unreasonanle to a superficial
observer. Hut let ns have patience,
and look further ahead. It would
bo well to rccollect that some of
the grandest agencies for the ame
lioration of the condition of man
kind have originated in a very hum
ble and insignificant way.
About a hundred years ago, a
boy, James Watt by name, sat one
day looking at a kettle of boiling
water, and holding a spoon before
the steam that rushed out ofjts
spout. He was reproached by his
Aunt for his idleness. Isn't it a
shame for you to waste your time
soî And yet the apparently tri
, fling action of this poor Scottish
lad, resulted in a discovery, which
in the magnitude and importance
of the changes which it has wrought
in the movements of the civilized
world, has surpassed the wildest
fancies of the Arabian Nights—and
to-day the splendid Cunarder,
breasting the waves of the Atlantic,
and throbbing with the .movements
of its Titantic Compound Engine,
and the powerful locomotive rush
ing across a continent with more
than the speed of the wind, testify
ing in tones more cmphatic than
any words that man can utter, to
the wonderful results which may
follow from causes and actions ap
parently the most insignificant.
And so it may be with this order
of the Patrons of Husbandry, triv
ial as its forms and ceremonies may
appear, insignificant as the results
of its introduction, of its meetings
so far may seem, there is neverthe
less in the order an element of
truth and power, which if. vitalized
by the action of live and energetic
Patrons, may yet prove au engine
powerful enough to lift our unfor
tunate people of the South from the
slough's of despair and despondeu
cy iu which they now seem so hope
lessly gunk# •
The error that we are all at first
liable to fall into, is a misappre
hension of the true character of the
advantages offered- by tho system
of the Patrons. They are indirect
in their nature and operation—
while proposing a scheme or plan
of action, which must commend it
self to the minds Öf «11 intelligent
men, for itq wise' and just enuncia
tion pt principles—it can avail noth
ing auless its members evince au
active and appreciative iuterest in
the execution of its plans and sug
gestions. In this it is not unlike
[other Important systems. Takefor
example that of Banking. Bank
ing facilities are indispensable to
the Qommerp ial prosperity, nay the
very existence of etfery enlightened
nation. And yet it is not the prov
ince of.the laws, governing and
regulating these matters— to create
these facilities for the inhabitants
of a country, nor to furnish them
with capital—but simply to give
them the opportunity of helping
themselves. Banks will not make
a poor man rich, or a poor cotnmu
nity rich, or compensate for the
want of capital, or pay the debts of
those who have nothing to pay with.
They can work no such financial
miracles. They are simply conve
niences, but not the creators of
wealth or of money. And so it is
with the scheme desired tor the
Patrons of Husbandry. Nothing
can be more admirable than the
specific objects of its organization,
and its scheme of work. Furnish
ing as it doos a bond of Union, and
a guarantee of just dealing, good
fellowship, and mutual help among
its members, what could commend
itself more to our people of this
time! But without the earnest,
active co -operation of its members,
in carrying into practical execution
the purposes of the order, what will
all the union, just dealing, good fel
lowship and mutual help amount
to stripped of these supports? they
appear as empty platitudes, fitted
for some ütopian school, or some
Arcadian community—but not for
the realities of a stern, selfish world.
The sum and substance of the
whole matter, fellow Patrons, is
this—the success and well being
of our order rests entirely with you
ils workers.* It is in your power to
make it a vital, living organism,
clearing your paths of many of
their, difficulties, aud lighting up
with the blessed rays of hope, pla
ces hitherto darkened with the
clouds of gloom and despair ; or we
can make it a dead, lifeless thing,
which the soonW it is buried, and
put out of our sight, the better it
will be for us all.
Do you believe in the "necessity
of union 1 then evince your faith by
the zeal of your efforts to secure it.
Do you desire that the principles
ot just dealing, good fellowship, and
mutual help,should obtain amongst
us, then prove your faith by cour
ageously and earnestly working
for their establishment. But it on
the other hand you can't feel this
interest, and persist in coming to
our meetings, whenever your con
venience suits or allows you, with
folded arms and scaled lips, for
heavens sake, djui't go away and
pronouueo the Grange a failure, a
humbug, because forsooth it won't
work miracles, or you can't §ee any
good that will come ot it.
Surely if ever a people needed
the aid of au organization consti tu
ted like this, that people is our
own—and I will not believe that its
advantages will be allowed to es
cape, without a full, fair, and hon
est trial. Every circumstance teyds
to stimulate our efforts. The mein
ories of happier and better days,
the recollection of homes once
filled with plenty and contentment,
and the realzation of our present
unhappy condition, all appeal to us
to leave no effort untried, by which
the hardships of our situation may
be alleviated. Certainly the times
are critical. The grim phantom of
ruin begins to show in our very fa
ces; and while we deplore our mis
fortunes—fiends in human shape
are gloating over the calamities, in
a great measure the work ot' their
hauds—and dancing, to the sweet
music of our woes.
We are the members of a common
race, our misfortunes have been of
a common origin and character, our
interests are alike, our fate will be
the same—why then, my friends,
should we not march shoulder to
shoulder iu the noble work of the
redemption of our State our fortunes
aud our firesides.
CP" We invite particular atten
tion to the call for a grand rally and
Mass Meeting, to organize a White
Man's Party, to be held at Colfax,
Grant Parish on Saturday, the 25th

attendance from llapides, and we
are certain that we will not be dis«
appointed. Don't forget the time

Editors Caucasian :
Dear Sirs The Mass Meeting
held in the city of Natchitoches on
13th June last, demanded the res
ignation ot certaift corrupt and in
competent members of the Police
Jury named J. R. Hornsby, a notd
rionsly bad white man, Ed Mitchell
Sam Black and John Holmes, ig
norant colored men; who have been
made the dnpes of D. H. Boult, the
leader of the gang of thieves who
have for so long a time plundered
onr people, and H. C. Myers, Jndge
of the Seventeenth District; Raford
Blunt, negro Senator and other cor
rupt men. The demand was also
coupled with a requirement that
there should be appointed four cit
izens named in the petition to the
Governor. The day set for the final
meeting of the corrupt Police .fury
was July 6th, 1874. On the 4th was
held iu Natchitoches a "Grand
Rally" as it was termed, to cele
brate the day, but which turned
out to be au occasion to air the
opinions of the radical leaders.—
Blunt, Redman, Lewis—negroes—
Boult, Pierson, Breda aud Tunard,
white radicals—spoke and they
emphatically said. that the Police
Jury of the Republican party would
not or should not resign or he remov
ed-, in the meantime the white peo
pie, from threats made by colored
leaders, on Friday to "put them
through" and such stuff, had pre
pared for any emergency and the
white people 0 in the country had
saoved up, so as to be in striking
distance, should any demonstration
be made. This party captured one
L. Dupliex, who had been che Bro
ker for the thieving school board
here, and one of the ring, on Hie
outskirts of the city whom they re
leased.
Dupleix rushed to the gathering
immediately, and gave tho alarm,
and in the midst of their blatant
bluff they caved , and the Police Ju
ry resigned unconditionally, and
with „as much haste as possible.
The people here are not near satis
fied, and will not stop nntil the
leaders are gotten rid of. We peo
ple of the Parish of Natchitoches,
are determined to drive these
leaders away peaceably if ice can,
forcibly if we must.

Editor Caucasian :
Dear Sir I notice an article in
Wednesday's Democrat headed The
Mails," which causes me to explain, if
you will permit me through your col
umns.
The time for the mail to leave Red
River Landing, has not governed me
in the departnre of the Coach, but I
have had it to wait one hour, and then
I sometimes do not get tho mail, on
account of the Boats not coming to
time. I have done, and will do, all in
my power to get the mails here, but
kill my stock. I am no United States
Beef eater, and I do not think I owe
the Butchers much for what I have
had—in other words, I buy my own
Beef.
As for the bad roads being all "bosh"
I do not think the Editor of the Demo
crat a competent judge. The road is
through au overflowed district, where
all the Bridges are washed away, and
holes washed in the road, and the peo
ple too bAsy planting to work them—
so we have to do the best we can.
If the Democrat is iu want of Edito
rial matter, I would suggest that he
turn his Battery on the Syndic's of the
road between here and Cheney vil le,
that would give him a chance to help
get the mails through in time. I shall
do all I can to give this community the
mails, but will not again notice the
Democrats tirade.
Respectfully. &c.,
N. L. McGINNIS,
Road Agent.
Before the Louisiana Central
Railway Company asks us for any
money, hadn't they better pay up
that little outstanding matter of
about Thirteen Thousand Dollars
they already owe for contracts made
and forfeited by, them ? Let ns
square off and commence anew. We
have got a bill of $270 to. collect, for
a poor man who liaulecl lics for them,
and who needs the money mighty
bad. They have never paid for"either
the ties or the hauling, and they lay
now at the «ad. of the track. We
know of others in the same fix!
• We have been waiting for the
people aud their political leaders to
suggest a time for holding a grand
Mass Convention of tbe people ot
'this parish, for the purpose ot or
ganization. The resolutions pass
ed at the public meeting and Bar
becue at Paul's store, four weeks
ago, recommended the calling of a
Mass Meeting at Alexandria, of
which due notice would be given
by the public press. Our columns
have been open, aud we are ready
to give notice whenever the time
is agreed upon. We have no Cen
trai committees whose dnty it is,
and who usually exercise the au
thority to designate the time of
public conventions, henoe the neces
sity of the people in mass meeting
coming together and selecting a
Central Committee, .and putting
the political machinery of their
party in operation. We* will per
haps be called upon at an early day
to send delegates to a Stain Con
vention, besides it is high time
that the people of Rapides bad de
termined upon the political issues
which they wish to present. The
Republicans on Saturday last, had
a meeting of their Central Commit
tee in this place, and no doubt
their midnight work of organiza
tion will commence, aud tue ne
groes be thoroughly disciplined
and drilled, before we are really
aware of it. If we would be suc
cessful, our organization must be
perfect, and tor this, much time is
required. There is an apathy on
the part of a great many, while
others have been so disgusted with
politics, it will require time to per
suade them to attend the places of
Registration to register * and vote.
We must remember that the battle
is not always for the strong; the ac
tive, the vigilant aud well organiz
ed party, often gains a decided suc
cess over the strengt!} of numbers.
In the city of New Orleans and
iu almost every parish in the State,
the good work of uniting aud
arousing the oppressed white people
has commenced iu earnest. This
parish which has so long suffered,
should not be the last to enter the
list, and declare her cmphatic de'
termination to free herself, and the
State, from negro domination—at
the next election—our success de
pends upon the unity of purpose,
tfrmony of action, and a thorough
aud lively canvass—au3 nothing
but a perfect organization will in
sure this. We therefore with the
deepest feelings of iuterest, in the
redemption of our State aud Parish,
earnestly recommend a convention
of the people to be held at this
place at an early day, not later
than the 2nd Saturday in August
next.

Hall Oliver Lodge No. 84, P. A. M. )
Alexandria. La. >
July 8th. 1874. )
At a meeting of tbe Officers and Broth
er» of Oliver Lodge No. 84, held this day;
Brother Jamés G. White announced the
death of Brother Kosciusko R. Hyams, a
member of this Lodge. Altera few feel
rrtg aud appropriate remarks on the sad
event, lie moved that as a tribute of re
spect a committee of three be . appointed
by the Worshipful Master to prepare aud
report a preamble and resolutions expres
sive of the sense of the Officers aud Broth
ers on the melancholy occasion.
Whereupon the Worshipfiil Master ap
pointed Bros. James O. White, Moses Ros
enthal and Henry St. John. After a short
recess the Committee through their Chair
man Bro. J. G. White, reported the follow
ing Preamble and Resolutions, which were
unanimously adopted.
The Lodge baa heaid, with feelings ot
deep and heartfelt sorrow, that it has
pleased Almighty God, in- bis all wise
providence, to remove by death, from his
sphere of usefulness on earth, our lamented
and worthy Brother Koniusko R. Hyauis.
His loss will long be felt not only by his
bereaved family and this Lodge, of which
he was an earnest worker and worthy
member, bnt by the whole community.
Of him it may be truly said he was one ot
God's noblest works "an honest man."—
Uniting with a fine andaremaikably clear
intellect, a heart snsceptible of the noblest
emotions and impulses, these qualities
won for him tbe confidence, friendship
and esteem of all who knew him. He
was an earnest aud fearless advocate
of the rigi.t; an nncmupromiisng en
emy of the wrong, however speciously
arrayed or popularly supported. Mild
and gentle in his nature ne was yet a
stranger to fear, and was ever the first to
respond whenever and wherever duty call
ed. But he is no more—the mystic circle
has been broken and one of its links forev
er gone. His doatb is but another me
mento of the mortality of the body—the
immortality of tbe sonl. The grave marks
tho resting place of tho one—"that Spirit
ual House not made with hands eternal in
the Heavens," the other; and our departed
Brother, "From .von Heavenly dwell
ing place. still in his glorv loves ns."
This, howovcr, is not tne time nor the
place for eulogy: deeper aud holier emo
tions now possess our hearts. Therefore,
as a tribute of esteem and respect for his
memory.
Besoived, That in liis-private ana social
intercourse he was soeiable, confiding, and
generous to a fanlt. Few men have de
scended to the grave with warmer attach
ments and personal friendships, or more
deeply lamented.
Resolved, That in his death tho Frater
nity have lost au esteemed friend, and this
Lodge an earnest worker, and truly a
Worthy Brother, endowed with every
manly and social virtue.
Resolved, That we affectionately sympa
thise with, and tender to bis bereaved
family our sincere condolemeuta upon
their irreparable loss.
Besoived, That as a tribute of respect to
the memory of the deceased this Lodge be
draped in mourning; and that the mem
bers wear the nsnal badge of mourning for
thirty days.
Resolved, That a copy of this Preamble
and these Resolutions bo forwarded to the
family oF-Our late Brother Hyams,' With the
assurance of the sincere condoleuce of the
Officers and Brethren of this Lodge.
Resolved, That tho Alexandria papers be
requested to publish these proceedings.
