the next centennial ?
"Old-fashioned families"are pop

number 85,ooo in one season.
If one will only go out of town a
few miles, in any direction, he can
not fail to be deeply impressed with
the crying need of a refinery here.
A despatch from Spokane, Wash.,
tells of the hanging of old "Bill"
Stebbins, for murdering his second
wife, by his son who is the sheriff.
As far aj our knowledge extends
the Sunday law is respected here.
As much, however, cannot be said
of some of our neighbnring towns.
Because a man who is about to be
arrested for a brea-h of the peace
makes a break for liberty gives a
policeman no legal right to shoot
him.
This is an age of "'get there" and the
town; that sleeps will not be in it.-Lake

Eminently correct, and just what
The Gazette has been telling the
people of Lafayette.
Spend your money at home. Buy
from your home merchants, they
will treat you right, and the money
thus expended, like bread cast upon
the water will return to you again.
The gentleman who stated that
he thought every person ought to i
take the trouble to give the editor
all the news items from the country 4
possible, made a very sensible re
mark.
Half of the hard labor, without
any of the privations, which would
bring indifferent success in the Cher
okee strip, would bring him not on
ly comfort but riches in Lafayette
parish.
Many of those who succeeded in
locating claims in the Cherokee
strip, notes the Louisville Courier
Journel, did so by taking tup the
six feet of earth which is all that 1
any of us gets in the end.
T"he Business Men's Association
have been taking quite a long nap.
is it not about time for them to
wake up, get together and discuss
the best means to have a central
Srefinery erected in this vicinity ?
- Brunswick, Georgia, is in the
deadly grasp of a yellow fever epi
demic; all business is paralyzed, t
and in consequence many families
are in dire distress. An appeal for
khelp has been sent out, and is being '

Sheriff Isaac Broussard of this 1
pauie,'and Sheriff C. T. Cade of
a parish, have jointly issued a
for a convention of all the sher- i
of this State to convene in this

organization of sheriffs similar<

daon the 14th of October.
SOME GOOD ADVIC.i:
The Shreveport Times has been
indulging in some plain language.
It tells the people that they have a
fine country-a country that grows
many varietes of woods, net to be
found elsewhere, and has many
other things. The country's cotton
crop, it adds, brings in millions of
dollars. And it very pertinently
asks :
What do you do with it? Spend it at
home ? Give it to your neighbor, who has
something you wtht ? Build up factories to
make what you need ? Not a bit of it.
You buy your shoes, thread, clothes, cali
co, yarn, buckets, meat, corn, flour, candy,
wagons, carts, plows, carriages, buggies,
everything, in fact, in New York, Massachu
setts, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, any
anywhere and everywhere, except at home.
Are you not ashamed of yourselves ? Take
your money you have made by honest toil,
put it inhome factories, then stick to it that
not a dollar shall go abroad that can be
spent for any want that can be supplied
from your native heath.
This is sound advice, which if fol
lowed must greatly enrich the South.
WVe think it was Edward Atkinson
who said it was but a question of
time when the factories must move
to the raw material. And the time
is only limited to the day that our
monied men will be willing to put
out their own capital, and then make
efforts to enlist the aid of capitalists
abroad. If the Southern people had
years ago adopted the plan so plain
ly laid down by the Times, we
would see today this fair southland
a humming hive of manufacturing
plants. It is a fact that cannot be
disputed that wherever in the South
manufacturing plants have been es
tablished and intelligently operated
they have proved paying invest
ments. Cast an eye over the latest
statistics, and the foregoing state
ment finds verification in the fact
that our existing factories have not,
during the present financial crisis,
been compelled to shut down. On
the contrary, they have made their
usual runs, and are, reports aver,
as strong financially, as they ever
were.
And the reason is clear. The raw
material is right at their doors. It
has been demonstrated, and is an
admitted fact that the cotton mills
in the South are selling their goods
in the Northern marts cheaper than
the mills of New England. This is
the usual result when goods manu
factured in the South, from raw ma
terial found in the South, are
brought in competition in the open
markets. The South is beginning
to realize this fact, and as a result
factories argspringing up every day.
GOING TOO FAR.
Some days since a gentleman,
whose business takes him over a
part of the parish nearly every day,
told The Gazette that the negroes,
now that they have a little ready
cash earned by picking cotton, con
gregate every Saturday night, and
under the pretence of enjoying a
dance, embraced the opportunity to
raise pandemomium, indulging in
fights, and used the vilest language,
which is getting to be a disagreable
nuisance.
Last Saturday some three or four
negroes were badly hurt in affrays
in different neighborhoods, and in
Carencro one was killed, the one
committing the deed being now in
jail. The underlying cause being
whiskey, it is asserted.
The continuation of these mid
night orgies can but be fruitful of
trouble, and something should be
done to restrict them to within de
cent bounds. No one wishes to de
prive the colored people of all pro
per amusement, but unless they
show a disposition to conduct their
entertainments in a becoming man
ner, they will invite measures for
their suppression. It would, per
haps, be best, for their own good,
that no intoxicating liquors be dis
pensed at these gatherings.
POSTAL CURRENCY.
The bill which has been intro
duced in the senate by Senator
Kyle providing for an improved is
sue of postal currency is one of con
cern and convenience to multitudes
of people who in carrying on small
transactions through the mails pay
too much in fees for money orders
and postal notes, besides putting
up with all the inconvenience of
procuring them. The bill provides
that these proposed fractional cur
rency notes shall be issued and re
deemed at the postoffices of tl
country, and shall be legal tender
in sums of less than one dollar. i
The only objection that could be
urged to this form of currency is the
one which was urged against the old
fractional currency of war times--
it becomes in time worn and filthy ;I
the same objections can be urged i
against bank notes, but that has
never been found a sufficient reason
for withdlrawing them. If it were 1
only provided that no note which
is returned to the treasury should
be re-issued, then these notes would
be always fresh and clean. Senator
Kyle's bill is.an excellent one.
Progressibn and Retrogression.
Lewis Haase, Adolphe Romero
and Thomas Gayle, some days since
in New Iberia, were "rolling for the
treats." Each lost one game. Haase
and Gayle paid their treats and Ro
mero refused to pay his. Some
days later Romero drove in front
of a drug store and tossing a dime
to Haase and Gayle, who happened
to be present, requested that a Seid
litz powder be purchased for him.
Instead of comply.ng with the re
quest the young men kept the dime
and told Romero they proposed to
liquidate the treat which he owed
them. Romero got mad and swore
out an affidavit charging Haase and
Gayle with larceny. They were
brought up before the justice of the
peace who issued the writ of - arrest,
and fined $2.56. They refused to
pay and the matter goes to a higher
court for settlement. This act of
the justice of the p'eace, if true,
which, by the way, we seriously
doubt, is only equalled by the po
lice juror, in one of the parishes,
who, under the impression that- his
official duties empowered him to do
so, was doing a land office business
for a while in marrying people.
An Eventful Trip.
Dr. G. A. Martin returned from
a visit to the World's Fair last Satur
day, and re orts having had a grand
time in (fago, and adds that no
man who can possibly do so should
fail to see this wonderful fair.
Among the many souvenirs brought
back were some type, which the
Doctor saw cast before his eyes, and
gave The Gazette a few samples.
The Doctor was on the Illinois
Central that was held up in Illinois
last week. The train was stopped
at midnight, and the railroad
employees rushed into the cars and
told the passengers to hide their
wealth, and asked those who were
armed to go forward. Of course
great consternation followed among
the passengers. The Doctor hid
his money in his bootleg, jumped
up and asked for a pistol. A little
lady from Cairo, Illinois, handed
him a revolver, and he started for
ward, but when he reached the plat
form some hunters aboard had
wounded and routed the robbers.
The Doctor stated his profession
and was called upon to examined
the wounded people.
The robber .was securely tied
and the train proceeded to the next
town, reaching there about two
hours after the train had been held
up. When the train came to a halt,
the fire alarm bells of the town were
set ringing, and soon the entire
population was out. Cries of lynch
ing rent the air, the rope was pro
duced, and the crowd was about to
mete out swift justice to the prisoner.
Dr. Martin jumped up and haran
gued the crowd telling them
that it would be cowardly to hang
the man-that as he was now in the
hands of the law, it was their duty
as good law-abiding citizens to let
the law takes its " course. His
counsel prevailed.
The Doctor tells The Gazette
that the Fair is a grand educational
institution, and the trip is worth
years of study,
To Stand Trial.

colored women, and two white men

Heror You Are. Boys !
The Gazette is. requested to say that the
Favorites would like to meet any '(base ball)
club of the adjoining towns. They are will
ing to play for money or glory.-Lafayette
Gazette, 23rd instant.
The Jennings base ball club holds the
championship of southwest Louisiana and is
ready to defend the title. If the Favorites
want a friendly game for money or glory,
their challenge will be joyfully entertained.

NECROLOGY.
Died, in St. Martinsville, Wednes
day morning,- the 27th instant, at
4:15, Mrs. Mary Mathilde Mouton,
wife of Mr. Fred Mouron.
When the sorrowful tidings of the
death of Mrs. Mouton reached La
fayette, it cast a gloom of painful
surprise and sadness over the entire
community. The news was so un
expected, that it was hard to realize
that this estimable lady had ren
dered her spirit to her maker. The
writer was in St. Martinsville last
week, and Wednesday saw Mr. and
Mrs. Mouton and children taking a
a walk on the banks along the bay
ou, and little did he think that the
angel of death was hovering over
the happy family, and that soon the
well-beloved wife and mother would
go to her eternal rest.
Born in November, 1869, she was
just entering upon the theshhold of
life, surrounded by a devoted hus
band and four children, (the eldest
seven years old) she could but feel
that life was about to unfold its
brightest pages, and a happy and
contented future would be hers.
Mrs. Mouton was an amiable and
highly esteemed lady, who number
ed a'wide circle of friends and re
lations. Her loss is deeply lament
ed by all who were familiar with her
kindness of heart and gentleness of
character.
Words, we know, are inadequate
to assuage the feelings of those so
terribly bereaved. The fountains
of deep sorrow and regret requires
time to spend their painful force,
and The Gazette can but extend its
sincere sympathy to the afflicted,
and fervently hope that the Great
Dispenser will give those so sorely
tried, fortitude to bear the heavy
cross that he has placed upon them.

To thl Editor of The Gazette:
As the season for the farmer is
drawing to a close, I will give a few
facts in regard to crops in this-vicin
ity : Corn, a fair crop ; 8o per cent
cotton, but a small amount planted;
80 per cent. sweet potatoes, a fine
crop; go per cent. sugar cane, fine
but only a little planted. Rice,
which is our principal crop, is near
ly a failure owing to a very dry sea
son, it not having rained to fill my
levees since August x6, 1892, over a
year ago. Last year Duson station
shipped over fifty thousand sacks,
will not ship eight thousand sacks
this crop. After carefully getting
all the information possible from
our principal planters, I find the
crop below 20 per cent. of an aver
age year, and taking last year as a
basis, which was an unprecedented
crop, we will fall below r2 per cent.
I visited a large portion of the rice
region, Crowley and Vermilion par
ish ; there will not be any where
an average of x5 per cent. of last
year. Rice is light and trashy. I
planted 6o acres near Crowley, will
make 30 sacks; I planted 165 acres
near Duson, will make 30 sacks.

About one-halt of our rice planters

Our little town is coming to the

bors have just unloaded lumber nec
essary to erect several dwellings.
This don't look like there were any
hard times hereabouts.
The public school has been.open

will increase this week. The school
is conducted by Prof. Toler, and
the belief is general that we have
the right man in the right place.
The Sunday school is progressing
nicely, .with an attendance of 40.
We are sorry to add that Lester
Huffpauir is going to leave us, and
we fear that we cannot find another
one so faithful to the cause.
We hear it rumored that we are to
have a rice mill started here soon.
If so, it will be a great thing, for it
is badly needed. We are in the
heart of the rice country, therefore
it must prove a paying investment.
