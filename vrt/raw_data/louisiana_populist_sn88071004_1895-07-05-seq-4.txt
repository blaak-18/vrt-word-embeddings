ITS POWER TO CONCENTRATE

The Drone With a Few Dollar More
Powerful Than the Man Who hPro
duces Wealth--uome Figures Thiat
Will Startle lou.
The power of interest to accumula' '
is not appreciated as it should b,.
When it is, there can be no quest ion
but that an intelligent people will re
fuse to continue a system fraught with
such a terrible danger to the progress
of civilization and the welfare of hu
manity. The following table will dem
onstrate the astonishing rapidity with
which compound interest accumulates
as the rate per cent increases:
$1 100 yrs. at 1 per cent, $2.7:,

S .. " 2°03.00
" 18 " 15.145,007.00
S " 24 2.5.51.779.401.00
Another practical Illustration is to
compare the man at work with the dol
lar at interest. At first thought it
would seem ridiculous to make the com
parison with even one man, but we
shall make it with all the producers
of the nation pitted against one dol
lar.
In 1890, after almost 400 years of la
bor of many millions of people, the total
accumulation of wealth of the nation
was about $62,500,000,000. This in
cluded a large amount of wealth
brought to this country by immigrants;
it also included the vast value of our
lands, forests, mines, etc., which we
did not produce, but found ready for
our use.
With the great shrinkage in values
that has since occurred the total accu
mulation would probably be less than
$50,000,000,000.
Now suppose that Christopher Colum
bus when he landed in America had
started a bank on a capital of one dol
lar, loaning the money at the rate of
10 per cent compounding at the end of
every three months as is the usual cus
tom with banks where they do not
charge interest in advance.
The capital would double every seven
years, and by 1890 would have ac
cumulated $143.603,198,813,228,032.
As a wealth accumulator the dollar
proves far superior to the most in
genlous, and industrious people; oc
cupying the most fertile country on
earth. Great are the United States of
America.
Great are the American people.
But 3,872,064 times greater is the
Shylock dollar at 10 per cent interest.
Another comparison which will come
closer home will be to anticipate the
result for the future by comparing the
power of the banks to accumulate
through interest with the ability of the
people to accumulate through produc
ton.
How long can the people keep aheal
of the banks?
How long until the banks own the
people aad the nation?
We will take as the basis of our cir
culation the average increase of the
wealth of the nation during the period
freeo 18 to 1890 as per ceasus reports,
sand will ignore the great shrinkage of
values already a fact.
Assume (an assumption not war
ranted by the facts or prospects) that
the nation will enjoy the same degree
ot prosperity as in the past decade,
s a annual increase of three per
aamu ansd ao Sanaetal depremmsions,

When we take into consideration the
fact that all values have decreased
fully 25 per cent during the past three
years instead of increasing at the rate
of 3 per cent per annum, and the further
fact of the vast amount of interest
collected by insurance companies, land
loaning syndicates. dividends of rail
road and other corporations, it is evi
dent that the nation cannot stand the
strain for another twenty years.
Interest must be abolished or we
perish as a nation.
The power that the system gives to
the bankers over the industry anti com
merce of the country is well illustrated
by the following clipped from the Hal
timore Sun (l)em.) of Aug. 20, 1893:
"When Venice was the republic that
ruled the financial and commercial
world the Council of Ten were the
potent magnates who swayed the des
tinies of nations. But not even in
their most influential hour did they
possess a tithe of the enormous power
that the council of six men, sitting daily
in New York, now wield. This modern
financial junta have an authority and
direct a wide reaching influence that
is probably unprecedented in the his
tory of all nations. No president's
cabinet, not even the directors of the
world-renowned "Old Lady of Thread
needle street," herself could approach
their possibilities. Their identity is
known to comparatively few of the mil
lions their actions affect. They are
the half dozen members of the loan
committee of the New York clearing
house. F. D. Tappan, president of the
Gallatin National bank, is the chair
man and his associates are E. H. Per
kins, Jr., president of the Importers'
and Traders' bank: J. Edward Simons,
of the Fourth National; H. W. Cannon,
of the Chase National; W. A. Nash,
of the Corn Exchange bank, and
George C. Williams, of the Chemical
bank. Each business day they meet
at the clearing house, 11 Pine street,
and by their decisions formulate the
policy of the New York banks, which
in turn dominates the tone of the finan
ces of the whole country and incidental
ly affects the rest of the world. In
the present emergency they have is
sued the $64,000,000 of loan certificates
that have stemmed the rising tide of
commercial depression. Their word is
the law countenancing the roan that
saves banker or merchant or the re
fusal that brings ruin. How few know
how much depends on the judgment
of those six men, and how few appre
ciate their tremendous power. -Dako
ta Ruralist.
Jefferson's Idea of Government.
Said Thomas Jefferson: "Let us
found a government where there shall
be no extremely rich men and no ab
jectly poor ones. Let us found a gov
ernment upon the intelligence of the
people and the equitable distribution of
property. Let us make laws where
there shall be no governmental part
nership with favored classes. Let us
protect all, in life, liberty and prop
erty, and then say to every American
citizen: With the gifts that God has
given you, your brain and brawny en
ergy, work out your own fortunes under
a just government and equal jurispru
dence."
The Democrats say now that good
crops is all that will save them. That is
to say having allowed every opportun
ity to go by to relieve the people they
are now willing to permit the Lord to
furtish the relief and they will ap
propriate the credit. It is about the
only thing left they have not appro
priated.

The Washington claim agents think
that under the income tax decision
they can make the government give

collected between 1863 and 1,71. If
the scheme works there will be some
135,000.00 for theagents. It is worth
trying for, they think.
