Tho Angel Over tho Eight Shoulder ;
<)k,
i'll ic ilkolnninu of a mow YlCAIt .
u a woman ' s wolle is never done ,"
Maid Mrs . . lames . u l am sure i
thought i would get . through by
sundown and here is this lamp , now
on which i must go and spend half
an hour before if will burn ."
" Don ' t , you wish you had " never
been married V said Mr . James ,
with a good natured laugh .
u Yos ,'' rose lo Mrs . James ' lips ,"
but a glance at her husband and
twolille urchins , who , with spark -
ling eyes and glowing cheeks , were
tumbling over him , cheeked that
reply .
•'i should like the good without ,
the , evil , if 1 could have it ," said
she .
"1 a in sure you have no great
evil to endure ," replied her luis
baud .
'• That is nil you gentlemen know
ab out it . How should you like , il . if
you could not get an uninterrupted
half hour to ' yoursell from morning
tonight '? What would become of
your favorite studies ?"
4i l do not think there is any need
of that . i know your work could
be arranged so systematically as to
give you some time to call your
own ."
" Well all i wish is " was Cao re -
ply , "( hat you should follow un -
round one day , and see what i have
( o do ."
When tlie lamp was trimmed the ,
conversation was resumed . mr
- James had beck giving the subject
some thought ,
" Wife ," said he , "i have thought
of a plan to propose , and i wish you
to promise me that y ou - will accede
foil . it is an experiment , audi
wish you to givo it a fair trial to
please me "
After hesitation awhile , as she
i'. ad great reason to suppose if
would be quite iiapractibie , she at
length promised .
" This is my plan . i wish you to
take , two hours outot every day tor
your own private use . Make a
point of going up info your room
and locking yourself in , and let tin -
work go undone if it must . Spend
this time in i lie way most profita
ble to yourself Now i shall hind
you down to your promise for one
month ; at , the end of thai time if it
has proved a total failure we will
t ry some other way ."
"When shall 1 begin?"
" To morrow ."
'I o morrow (tame. Mrs. James
had selected the t wo hours before
dinner as the most convenient Ibr
I «er; and as (he lamily ('lined at, one
o elock, she was t o have finished her
morning work, be dressed and in
her room ;ii eleven. Hearty as hei
ellorts were to accomplish, Ike ap
pointed hour lound her work but
liait i ! one; yet, true to her promise,
she retired to In-;- room and turiuuf
the key of her dour.
Atter spending perhaps hall'an
hour in forming her plans for study
she drew up her table, placed her
books before her, prepared pen and
paper, and commenced with much
eut husiiism. Scarcely was the pen
dipped in ink, w hen there was a
tramping of little feet , along the
hall, and a loud pounding on tin
chamber door.
"Mama, mamma, i can't find my
mittens, and Prank is going with
out me to slide.
"CotoAyiy, daughter, mamma
is busy now."
Amy is busy, too, and says she
can't leave t he baby."
I pon this the child began to erv.
The easiest way for Airs James to
settle the difficulty, and, indeed, the
only way, was to go aiid hunt up
the missing articles. Then a par
ley must be held with Prank to in
duce him to wait for his sister, and
the little girl's tears must tie dried,
and hitle hearts must be set right
befoic tho children were sent, out
to play, ami a little, lecture given,
loo, on the necessity of putting
iiings wheie they belong.
i ime slipped away, and when
Mrs James returned' to her stud;,
lier watch told that an hour had
gone. She quietly resumed her
tas. i, and was getting well under
way again, when a heavier step was
heard, and net door was once more
tried. Now Mr. James must be ad
mitted.

Mrs ». James went for her work
basket , and followed him . Tlx
tape was sewed on , then a button
needed fastening , and then a slij
in his glove must ," be mended .
Mrs . James took the glove and
stitched away at it , with a smili
lurking in the corners of her mouth
" What are you laughing at 2" iu
quired her husband .
" To see how famously your plan
works ," replied she .
"I declare !" said he , " was this
your study hour ? i am sorry , but
what can a man do ? lie cannot
go down town without a shirt bo
som ."
" Certainly not ," replied his wife ,
quitely .
When her liege lord was fairly
equipped , Mrs . James returned to
her room again . About , half an
hour remained to her , of whiwli she ,
was determined to make the most
Once , more was her place found , and
her pen dipped in ink , when there
was another disturbance in the en
try . Amy had returned with the
baby from his walk . she, took him
into the nursery to get him to
sleep . Now the only room in the
house where Mrs . James could have
any fire to herself was the room ad
joining the nursery . . The ordinary
noise of the children did not dis -
turb her ; but the very extraordina -
ry one which Master Charley felt
called upon to make , when he was
fairly upon his back in the cradle
was rather more than could be
borne by most mothers without
seriously disturbing the train of
their thoughts .
The words of the author rose and
fell with tho bawls and screams of
the child . Mrs . James closed her
book until the storm could be over -
past . Soon a ! ter quiet was restor -
ed , the children came in from their
sliding , crying with cold fingers .
Just at the time the bell rung , Mrs .
James closed her book iu despair .
" How do you succeed with your
studies this morning ?" inquired
Mr . James .
"Famously,"replied Mrs. James;
"I read about seventy pages of Gor
man and as many more of French."
" Why , ! am sure i did not hin -
der you long ."
" No ; your's was only one ol a
dozen interruptions."
"Oh, well, you must not get dis
couraged. You cannot expect to
succeed the first time. Persist in
it, until the family learn, that it
they want, anything of you, they
must, come at some other time»."
"Hut what is aman to do," re
plied his wile, "lie cannot go down
town with a, string off his bosom,
and a rip in hi:-; glove !"
"Well, I was in a bad fix," re
plied Mr. James. "I dare say it
will not happen again. At any
rale try the month out and see
what v. ill come of it."
'Hie see,and day of this trial hap
pened to be a stormy one ; and as
the, morning was very dark, Ibidg
et overslept, herself and breaklast
was one hour late. This io.-t hour
Mrs. James could not recover.
Pleven o'clock e une, and her morn
ing work hall done. With a mind
disturbed and depressed, she, left
tilings in the siyls as I hey were and
retired punctually to her study.
She found, however, that it, was
impossible to fix her attention upon
anything which required thought.
Neglected duties haunted her as
ghosts do the guilty conscience.
Finding that she was really do -
ing nothing with her blinks , and
wishing not to lose the morning
wholly , she . commenced a letter ,
when Uridgct came to her door be -
fore she had written half a page ,
" What shall we have for dinner ,
ma ' am There ain ' t no marketing
come , and you did not tell me w hat
to get."
"Have some steaks."
"We hain ' t got none."
"Well, I 'll send for some."
Now there was no one to send
but: Amy, and Mrs. James knew it.
With a sigh she put away her let
ter and went into the nursery.
"Amy, Mr. James has forgotten
the marketing, f wish you would
run over to the provision store and
order some beef steaks ; I will stay
with the baby."'
Amy was none too well pleased
t o be sent on this errand. She re -
marked that 'She must first change
lier dress."
.''
.
,
,
" lie as quick as possible , then
said Mrs . James , " for i am partie
ularly engaged lhis morning ."
Amy neither obeyed nor diso
beyed ; but managed to take her
own time , in reality , though with
out , any determination to do so .
Mrs . j.,. thinking she might , get
along it sentence in , the , nursery
took her German book in ; but to
this arrangement Charlie would by
no means consent . Mamma , must
show 1 11 m the kitties in the book
whether there or not , it was all one
to him — but , amused he must be
Halt lier second day ' s time of trial
was gone , w hen Amy came iu ; and
with a sigh Mrs . James returned to
her room , iteforn one o ' clock k I m
had been called down to the kitch
en twice on important business re -
lating to tlte dinner , and for this
day not one entire page of si. letter
had been written .
On the third morning she rose
e a rly , made every provision for din
ner and for the comfort of tho fam -
ily , which she deemed necessary ,
and elated , she entered her study
precisely at eleven o ' clock . Now
she was to have a fine time of it .
Her books were opened and a hard
lesson summoned to the conflict .
Scarcely had s hi }' read a line when
she heard the door bell ring .
" Somebody wants to see you iu
the parlor , Mrs . James .
" Tell them i am engaged , Bridg -
et ."
"i told them you were to home
ma ' am , and they gave me their
names , but i did not exactly under -
stand .»
Mrs . James was obliged to go .
To smile when she felt sober , to lie
attentive when her thoughts were
elsewhere . Her friends , however ,
seemed to find her agreeable , for
they made her a long eall ; and
when they rose to go , others came .
So in the most unsatisfactory ehil -
" uit all this morning went .
On the next , day Mr . James in -
vited some company to tea , and
Mrs . James was obliged to give
the morning to prépaie for it , and
did not enter her study . On vhe
following day , she was obliged t .o
keep her bed with sick - headache ;
and on Saturday , Amy having ex -
tra work to do , the charge of the
baby devolved upon her . tluu
passed i he first week .
Turn to her promise , Mrs . James
patiently persevered fora month ,
in her efforts to secure to . herself
this fragment ol broken time, with
what success the week's history can
tell. With its close, closed the
month of December. Leing partic
ular!;/occupied on the last day of
tho old year, iu getting ready for
t he morrow's iesl.ival, iL was near
t-he I a.•>.(, hour ol the day when she!
made her good night call iu the
nursery. She went, to the crib to ;
look at the baby; t here he lay fast :
asleep in Iiis innocence aue beauty. |

and stroked his golden hair, and
pressing his little dimpled hand with
in hers, she drew the warm cover
in;; more closely around him, care
fully tucking it in, then stealing one
more kiss, she left him in his slum-!
bors and sat down on her daughter's
bed. She was also sweetly asleep,

oven her hours of religious médita- j
tion had been encroached upon »yd j
distracted. She had accomplished !
nothing, that she could see, but keep!
her iamiiy ; and to her saddened !
thoughts even this seemed to have
been but indigcrently done. j
She felt, she was sure, no desire:
to shrink from duty, however hum
ble, but she sighed for some comfort
ing assurance of what icu>; dutv.
Her pursuits, conflicting as they did
with her tastes seemed to her frivo-'
luiis.—She felt there was some way'
of living, which she, from want of
energy or principle, had failed of
discovering. As she leaned over her
child her tears fell fast upon that
young brow.
How earnestly wished that moth
er that she could shield L'er child
from the disappointments, and self- ;
reproaches, and mistakes from which,
she was suffering ; that the little one j
might lake up life w.n.re she could
give it to her, rnend'-d by a!i her own

great comfort could ßlio have fooglit
the battle for both .
Yet . she knew thnfit could ' not bo
ho ; that wo must all learn '«far'totath
selves what nro thoso things whicli
heip make our peace .* With tears
still in her eyes , who gave the goo (|
night to tho child , and with fioïV huip
entered tho adjoining room , and
thoro fairly kissed oat the old
nu another rosy cheek which nefctje^
among the pillow « , then shy « ought
her own rest .
Soon sho found herselffn a singu
lar place . She was traversing a vast
plain ; no trees were v »« iblo sav«i
those which skirted tho horizon ; ou
their top rested a wreath of golden
clouds . Before her, traveling to;
wards that distant light was ft female:
Little children were about her/ some
times in her arms , and sometimes afe
her side . As alio journeyed on alio
she busied herself caring for theui.
Now she soothed them when weary
now she taught them how to travel ,
and again she warned them of tho
pitfall » and stumbling block * in tljo
way , She helped them over the or »«,
and taught them to bo wary of the
other . She talked to them of that
golden light which she kept constant
ly in view , and towards whiçh alio
seemed to be hastening her lilt Ic*
flock . lint what was most remark -
able , was that , all unknown to her,
two golden clouds floated above her,
on w hich reposed two angels . Beforo
each was a golden book and a pen of
gold . One angel with mild and
loving eyes , peered constantly ' over 1
tho right , shoulder , the other over the
left . they followed her from tho
rising to tho setting of tho pun.
They watched every word , and louli,
and dood , no matter how trivial .
When it was good , the angel over
the right shoulder , with a glad sinile
wrote it down in his golden book ;
when evil , however trivial , tho angel
over tho left shoulder wrote it down
in his book . Then ho kept his sor -.
rowful eyes on her until ho found
penitence for tho evil ; upon which
lie dropped a tear on his record and
blotted it out , and both angels re -
joiced . To the looker on it seemed
as if tho traveler did little which wan
worthy of such careful record .
Sometimes she did but bathe tho
weary feet of her children , and tljo
angel over ner right « boulder wrote
it , down . Sometimes siio did but
wait patiently to lure back some lit ,
j tie truant who had taken a step ia
i t-lio wrung direction , and the angel
over tho right shoulder wrote it
down .
Sometimes, with her eyes fixed
upon the golden horizon, shodjeeame
so intent upon her own progress as
j to let tho little pilgrims at her side
j languish cr stray, then it was the an
gel over lier left, ohoulder who lifted
*ho golden pen aruPmado the entry,
; following 1er with sorrowing eyan
: seeking to blot it out. Jt, wishing to
| hasten on her journey, she left tho
j littles ones behind, il, was the 8<»ï
look
1 on , that , thi
to
ioo
record, arul was
br,

gress. And the observer felt, as tho
was a faithful
kept to her
journey s end. The strong elaspe of
also im
pressed her with the belief flrit 4 tliev
were t< be sealed for a future open
ing. Her sympathies wore warmly
excited for the traveler ; and with a
beating heart she quickened her
steps that she might overtake lier

' entrent her to be watchful, and fait It
that its
gold on those golden, books,
1
when tiiose golden books should bo
unclasped. That she must not
think any duty which felljin her w^y
to do trivial, for i-nrely there was an
angel over her right, shoulder, or one
