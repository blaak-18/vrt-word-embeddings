OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have been
reading the children’s letters, so
thought I would write one, too. I
am a little girl, eleven years old. I
have never written a letter to any
paper. I will write to yours first. I
live in the country, and like it very
much. My papa is a farmer. He
raises corn, cotton, potatoes, and cat
tle. I go to school. My teacher’s
name is Miss Louise Miller. I will
answer some of the riddles. Sarah
Ponder’s is an umbrella; Flossie
Jackson’s a cow bell; and Glenn
Denton’s is a negro riding a mule,
with a washpot on his head. Now I
will ask one:
There was a living creature;
A human soul dwelt in it, too;
But for a space not long, ’tis true;
This creature on whom I make my
boast,
At God’s command gave up the
ghost;
His walk through life there’s none
can scan;
And of his death there knows no
man.
Send me some sample papers, and
I will try to get you some subscrib
ers.—Your little friend, Easter Mat
thews, Jonesboro, Ga.
NEW FRIEND FROM FLORIDA.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l thought I
would write a few lines to The Jeffer
sonian. Papa takes The Jeffersonian
and Magazine; he likes to read both.
I saw some riddles in the last paper.
I will answer Glenn Denton’s riddle
—a negro sitting on a mule, with a
wash-pot on his head. How many
of you can answer this riddle?* Red
as a rose; if you don’t answer this,
I will bite off your nose. The first
one that guesses it I will send them
a card. If I see this in print, I will
come again.—Your new friend, Ada
Lewis, Rt. 2, Havana, Fla.
LONDON BRIDGE, DON’T YOU
KNOW?
Dear Daddy Jim:—l have been
reading all the nice letters in The
Jeffersonian, so I thought I would
write and see if you would let me in
your happy corner. I wrote once be
fore, but I suppose my letter hopped
in the waste basket. Papa takes The
Jeffersonian and Magazine. He reads
them, and thinks Mr. Watson is the
finest man in the United States. I
am going to school now, and having
a fine time. I am in the seventh
grade. My teacher is Mr. Townsend;
he is a good teacher. I received the
card you sent me; it sure is pretty.
The answer to Glenn Denton’s riddle
is a negro riding a mule, with a
wash-pot on his head. I will give
some riddles: White as milk, and
milk it ain’t; green as grass, and
grass it ain’t; black as mud, and mud
it ain’t. As I crossed the London
bridge, I saw something white as
snow; when I came back it was yel
low as gold. I will close.—Your
friend, Carrie Lewis, Rt. 2, Havana,
Fla. Age fifteen.
FLIPPITY-FLOP.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Is there room
in your happy band for a Georgia
boy twelve years old, with brown
eyes? Papa takes both The Jeffer
sonians, and likes them fine. He
thinks there is no man like Mr. Wat
son. He cart hardly wait from one
paper until the next. The answer
to Sarah Ponder’s riddle is a pair of
tongs. Flossie Jackson’s is a cow
bell. I will ask some riddles: Two
men owned a flock of. sheep; one
man said to the other, “Give me one
of your sheep and I will have twice
as many as you.’ The other said,
“No, give me one of your sheep and
I will have as many as you.” What
number would both have to have?
What goes all around the house and
doesn’t make but one track? What
has four feet up and four feet down;
soft in the middle and hard all
Ghe 3effarsonian
around? Big at the bottom and lit
tle at the top, and something in the
middle goes flippity-flop? To every
one that answers these riddles I will
send a pretty post-card. I will tell
who Daddy Jim is; I think it is T.
E. W.—Your Georgia friend, Carlyle
Giles, Rt. 1, Deepstep, Ga.

My teacher’s name is Mr. John Davis.
The most of the boys and girls give
a riddle. The answer to Flossie
Jackson’s is a cow bell. I will ask
one: As I went over the London
bridge, I met an old man; his beard
was flesh, and his mouth was horn;_
there was never such an old man
born. I will close, with best wishes,
to Daddy Jim. —Your little friend,
Bobbie Lee Davis, Rt. 1, Barwick, Ga.

third attempt to write. I enjoy read
ing the children’s page. I got two
post-cards from Bascom House, and
one from Carrie Adams. The answer
to Glenn Denton’s is a negro on a
horse, with a kettle on his head.
Here is a riddle: In yonder green
hollow there stands a wight; all sad
dled, all bridled, all ready to fight;
steel was his arrow; brass was his
bow; I’ve told you this riddle three
times in a row, and yet you don’t
know. —From your little friend, Jen
