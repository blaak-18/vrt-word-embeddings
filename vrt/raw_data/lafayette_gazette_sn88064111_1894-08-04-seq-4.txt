the top. In either case the table must 1
be provided with a foot lever as shown a
in the lower cut. The middle board is
solid and the outer ones fastened to it I
by means of hinges. The outer boards
must be free so that they can be
raised to a vertical position. The mid
dle board is covered with a strip of
leather one foot wide which is firmly 4
fastened at one end of the board. A I
strip of iron is riveted across the other
end of the leather to the middle of 1
which a light chain is attached. Just
inside the strip of iron are three holes
in the leather indicated by H, lH, I, in
the upper out. 8, S, 8, are grooves
made in the leather for holding the 1
twine in place. To prevent waste of
string use three separate balls of
twine, which can be kept in a box un
derneath the table. Draw the twine
up through the holes e, H, H, place 1
it in the grooves S, S, S, and fasten 4
in the notches N, N, N, at the I
front end of the table. Spread a
out the fleece and turn up the side
leaves and fasten them with the hard
wood hook. Now take up the loose
end of the leather and turn it toward
the front of the box rolling the fleece
at the same time. Pass the end of
the chain over the front of the table
and hook it to the foot lever as shown
in the lower cut. By pushing the foot
lever downward, the fleece can be
rolled tightly. Bring the ends of the
twine through the holes in the leather
and tie. The knots Will pass back
through the holes. Turn back the
leather, drop the side leaves, replace
the .twine and the box is ready for
another fleece. This form of box is
somewhat expensive, and difficult to
construct, but it has the advantage of
rolling the fleece tightly and keeping
it compressed until tied. A fleece that
is not parted in shearing will, when
tied in one of these boxes, present a
white, fluffy surface and be more at
tractive to the buyer than if loosely
rolled up on the ground or floor and
tied with common twine. Fleecer
thus bound occupy less space and are
more easily handled.
POULTRY PICKINGS.
DUcK eggs, when hatching, require
less moisture than do the eggs of hens.
IF strong chicks are desired, see to it
that the eggs are from healthy stock
that has not been overfed.
HARD-SHELT.ED eggs produce the most
vigorous chicks. Those from soft
shells are apt to be weakly.
THER is more profit in raisin g geese
than chickens, and it is surprising that
progressive farmers do not go in for
them more.
SEE to it that the setting hens have
fresh water and plenty of fattening
food, and do not neglect the supply of
gravel and the dust bath.
IsVHE shipping poultry see to it that
the coops are large enough to permit
the fowls to stand up and strong
enough to endure rough handling.
ONLY those chickens which are in
tended for early marketing should
be pushed. With the others it is only
pdesorable to maintain a thrifty growth.
Eems with dark yolks are much rich
er and more nutritious than those
with pale yolks. The color of the
shell is no indication of the richness of
the egg.
Dunmo the first six wreeks chicks of
the dicerent breeds weigh pretty
nearly the same. After that time,
though there is a steady and continu
ous gain on the part of the large
breeds.
IF you would make a success of the
poultry business, start only with a
very few, and increase as you gain ex
perience. Jt is the ignorant ones who
start in on a large scale who make a
failure of the business. In no other
branch is it more necessary to "go
slow." *

PORCINE ESCAPE PIPE.
Peeualar uaetiemo Performed by She Legs
of a eng.
The. hog's legs perform a function
not known to any other animal, and
that is an escape pipe or pipes for the
discharge of waste water or sweat not
used in the economy of the body.
These escape pipes are situated upon
the inside of the legs above and below
the knee in the forelegs and above
the gambrel joints in the hind legs,
but in the latter they are very small
and functions light; upon the inside
of the fore leg they are in the healthy
hog always active, so that moisture is.
i always there from about and below
these orifices or ducts in the healthy
hog. The holes in the leg and breath
Sing in the hog are his principal and
only means of ejecting an excess of
heat above normal, and when very
warm the hog will open the month and
breathe through that channel as well
as the nostrils.
{ The horse can perspire through all
the pores of its body, much as a mar
and cattle do the same to a limited ex
tent, but the hog never. His escape
F valves are confined to the orifices upon
the inside of his legs.
People often wonder why it is that
the hog dies so suddenly when he runs
rapidly or takes quick and violent ex
i ercise by fighting, but when you con
; sider the few escape pipes, their' small
I capacity and remoteness from the cavy
ity where the heat is generated, the
wonder is not that he dies quickly when
overheated, but that he lives as long as
I he does when heated up;-Swine Breed,

The Summer with Poultry.
,r The advantage of the summer season
is that the cost of keeping poultry is
e but very little, as the larger share can
g be picked np by the hens if they are
fon a range. The profit in summer is
fully as large as in winter, for the hpns
t will lay twice as many eggs in summer
t as in winter, and thus compensate in
g quantity for low prices. It should be
impressed on the readers not to fied
grain except sparingly, as the hens wll
soon be thrown out of condition by too
much food when the weather is warm.
In some cases excessive beat cause
very fat fowls to succumb. With an
' abundant supply of grass, seeds and
e insects there will be no lack of a varie
e ty. Grain should not be given at all
when the hens are inactie. They
should be made to seek their food as
much as possible, and by so doing they
will keep in better health. They
e, should have plenty of fresh water, and
Lcare must be taken not to overcrowd
a them on the roosts, especially on very
warm nights.-Farm and Fireside.
a Damsjese In Poultry e aupe
- When a poultry house is lined with
o tarred paper it is frequently the cams
a that the house is damp. This is due t4
r several causes, among them being that
o new' lumber gives ofn more or less
moisture, and tarred paper eondenses
the moisture of the room. When the
house is thoroughly seasoned this may
c not happen. The -doors and windows
â¢ should be kept open during the day.
K' and during cold weather a lump of
re stone lime should be plaeed in the cow
st nr of the room to absorb the mia
t ture. It is not due to the exhalations

Easily Made and Useful.
To make a convenient bag for paper
and twine, double a yard of creponne,
joining the edges with a puff of cam
bric of a solid and harmonizing eolor:
At the top turn in each of the four
edges for several inches, so that the
two sides end in a point. Fasten these
together with button and buttonhole
and sew here ribbon loops and ends by
which to hang up the bag. To one
side sew a triangular outside pocket,
with a box-plait in the middle of it.
Make deep rather than broad; this is
for the twine. It forms a very handy
receptacle for wrappings and one to
which the family will be apt to often
repair if hung in one accustomed place.
ow to Clean Windows.
Simple as the operation may seem
there is a way to clean windows and a
way not to clean them. The following
suggestions may be of use to some, as
they save both time and labor: Choose
a time when the sun does not shine on
the window, else it will dry streaked,
and no amount of rubbing can prevent
it. Brush off all the dust inside and
out; clean the woodwork around the
glass first. Use for this warm water
and ammonia; do not use soap. Wipe
9 dry with cotton cloth. Do not use
linep, as it leaves lint on the glass
when dry. Polish with tissue or old
newspaper.
