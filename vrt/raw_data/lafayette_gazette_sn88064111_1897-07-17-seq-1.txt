The pupils of St. Ann's Convent,
conducted by the sisters of Mount
Carmel, closed its first half session
on July 8, by a very successful en
tertainment. The upper part of the
building was used as a hall, a neat
stage erected and a large number
of relatives and friends assembled
to witness a very creditable per
formance, especially when we con
sider that the sisters have had
charge of the pupils for five months
only. The drills, dialogues, songs
and recitations would have been
creditable to pupils of much greater
experience, while the display of
fancy work and plain sewing must
have been a source of pride to
teachers and pupils. Refreshments
were sold and netted a neat little
sum for the pressing needs of the
convent. The pupils received a
number of pretty books, premiums
for diligence and deportment, while
the principal prizes were distri
buted as follows: Silver medal,
donated by Father Laforest,
Bwarded to Miss Anna Brun. Sil
ver medal for grammar, donated by
Rev. Father Grosse of :Marksville,
awarded to Miss Anna Brun. Sil
ver medal for general excellence,
donated by Dr. E. J. Perrault of
Carencro, drawn for by Masters
Oscar Mouton and Simon Arce
naux, won by Oscar Mouton. Sil
ver medal for arithmetic, drawn for
by Miss Ida Robichaux, Masters
Oscar Mouton, Michel Crouchet,
Simon Arcenaux, Louis Breaux
and Ernest Guidroz, won by Michel
Crouchet. This medal was given
by the Institute. Silver heart
awarded Aston Benoit for daily al
tar service, premiums for altar
service awarded also to Masters
Oscar Mouton, Simon Arcenaux

Father Laforest. Premiums for
choir singing, awardea Misses Ines
Bernard, Luce Bernard, Odile
Crouchet, Lydie Bernard and
Calice Bernard. Premiums for
sewing awarded to Misses Cecile
Landry and Odile Crouchet. The
parents of Carencro have certainly
cause to congratulate themselves
upon having the good sisters to
conduct the education of their
children. The following pro
gramme was well rendered by the
children:

enjoyed, while the American and
French flags waved together in the
breeze, giving a festal air to the
streets of Carencro.
AT SCOTT
News Items Picked Up by The Gazette
Correspondent.
The charming Miss Mamie Price
returned home from the Teche,
after a long and pleasant visit with
friends and relatives.
Miss Isaure Gillard, of Rayne,
is spending a few days with Miss
Sophie Sonier.
Mr. J. J. Price is on the sick hst
this week, and Mr. A. C. Prejean is
still quite ill.
Mr. A. Delhomme received a car
of machinery for his new gin.
The donations for our Catholic
church fair are coming in rapidly.
The list from New Orleans mer
chants will be a very long one.
This shows how an intelligent class
of people can foresee the future of
a great town, and their appreciation
of a good cause. The fair takes
place as advertised, July 24 and 25,
and we predict a large attendance,
weather permitting. Please allow
me to say that the community of
Scott is rich and large enough to
support a church, and christianized
enough to build one. A church is
a necessity in all towns to elevate
the morals of a great many, but as
the Scott community is a religious
and christian one, we need a church
for the sake of christianity and the
future welfare of our children. As
we said before, a place without a
church is worthless to live in, hence
the reasons are good and clear
enough why Scott should have one,
and one we will have. It is not
very agreable to walk six miles to
attend divine services when one can
attend at home. Probably some
can ride. I for one cannot; simply
because I have no means or way to
do so, and with a church in our
midst could easily attend. I may
not be an angel with wings, still I
have propounded the church ques
tion until I am nearly exhausted,
but as long as there is breath left I
will continue until Scott is blessed
with one. If religion exercised Is
only a profession for the Almighty
dollar, we think it is about time to
save the dollar and keep it at home,
where it will do more good. If re
ligion is for the good and elevation
of the morals of those who need it,
then why not encourage it. If, as
remarked, we, of Scott, cannot ob
tain one who can teach us the clear
path, we will be compelled to re
main as monkies or barbarians,
searching whom we can devour
without the privileges of dying as
christians. It has been repeated
oftimes that we should not be dic
tated to in regards to our welfare,
and now is the time to press a foot
where needed. I must close with
the conclusion that a refined pro
gram will be rendered Sunday night,
July 25. The conclusion will be a
recitation entitled "Church."
I wish to state that during the
fair, there will be a pigeon shooting
match, and for the winner an im
ported English saddle or a nickle
plated harness will be given to the
champion shot. The champion
egg-thrower at the head of Hon.
Martin Goodman, African, will re
ceive a valuable premium. Fostin
Vincent and Felix LeBlanc chal
lenge C. C. Brown, L. Levy, Jules
Servat, and even Louis Nolive to a
men's race zoo yards. The champ
ion receives a premium. The peo
ple around Scott are plentiful and
they are comming forth with the ne
cessities, and I think they are hu
man beings and not monkies to be
denied the rights of exercising their
religious functions, and why a few
fanatics should kick is amazing to a
civilized people. Carencro has a
church, Lafayette has one, why
Scott should be without one is only
incomprehensive. Now that the
wheel of prosperity has been turned
and the people have opened their
eyes, the future of Great Scott is
fast opening, and its people are re
alizing at sleep is only healthy 6
to 7 hours, but not centuries. "Ye
help us and we will help thee" is o
motto.
The Great Scott Telegraph Co.
have arranged to have their wires
on the grounds for accomodation
of the people. They have reduced
their rates to ten cents per message
to all parts of the world.

James J. Lewis Mortally Wounds
Himself With Fatal Intent.
Special to The Times-Democrat.
OPELOUSAS, July 13.-One of the
saddest fatalities that has ever
taken place in Opelousas occurred
this evening at 6 o'clock, when
James J. Lewis, a promising young
man just in the bloom of life, shot
himself with a 4x-calibre Colt's re
volver, the bullet taking effect half
an inch above the heart. The phy
sicians agreed in the opinion that
he could not possibly survive.
Young Lewis is the son of
Thomas H. Lewis, Esq., one of the
leading members of the bar here,
and a nephew of ex-Judge E. T.
Lewis, now assessor, and a family
prominent throughout the State.
He stood high in this community,
being a young man of sterling in
tegrity and irreproachable charac
ter, and possessing an amiable,
kind and loving disposition.
He has been a notary public for
several years and worked in his
brother's law office.
A few months ago he formed a
co-partnership in the insurance
business with H. E. Ratcliff, under
the firm name of Lewis & Ratcliff.
The new firm apparently flourished
until recently. He established a
branch office at Lafayette and him
self took charge of it. He would
visit Opelousas every week, and,
as customary, came here Sunday,
returning Monday.
He seemed as jovial as ever and
his host of friends did not for once
imagine that self-destruction was
then in his mind. This evenings he
came upon the 4;19 train and im
mediately proceeded to the resi
dence of his father. Without
speaking to anybody, he entered his
room and drawing his pistol delib
erately aimed it at his heart and
fired.
The shot attracted the neighbors
and his family, and when the room
was entered he was found lying on
the floor with his life-blood gushing
out of his breast. The news was
dispatched throughout the town and
soon a surging mass of people wer*
assembled at the house, in the yarn
and on the outside. The physi
cians at once pronounced the
wound mortal.
No cause can be assigned for the
act. He was of a disposition to
brood over trouble, however trivial
it might be, and the natural con
clusion is that in a fit of despon
dency, brought about by some
reversal, he concluded to end his
life. He is perfectly conscious at
this writing, and admits that he in
tended self-destruction. He was a
member of the parish Democratic
executive committee and secretary
of that body.
The people of Lafayette were
shocked to read the foregoing
special in Wednesday's Times
Democrat.
Although the wound was pro
nounced mortal by the attending
physicians, we are glad to say that
his condition has been improving
gradually and his friends have
hopes of his recovery. James
Lewis came to Lafayette about two
months ago and opened an in
surance agency. He is a genial,
affable and generous young man,
and he soon won the esteem of the
people of this town. Possessing a
bright intellect and many admira
ble qualities, he soon became a
general favorite in all circles. Al
though a resident of this place only
a short time, he is one of our
most popular boys, and his at
tempted suicide was sad news to
tlhose with whom he was thrown in
contact during his stay here. The
people of Lafayette join those of
Opelousas in extending their sin
cere sympathy to the stricken
family of the unfortunate young
man, and offer their heart-felt con
dolence to his afflicted father and
mother.
Letter From Lieut. Moss.
We publish below a letter from
Lieut. James Moss, U. S. A., son f
of our townsman, Judge A. J. Moss, t
from Dunning, Neb. Lieut. Moss !
now on his way to St. Louis, s
having left Fort Missoula, Mon- s
tana, some time ago with the inten- c
tion of making an experimental J
trip on the bicycle at the instance c
of the U. S. Army authorities. F
Lieut. Moss has made a national s
reputation in his efforts to introduce I
the wheel as a factor in the armny
and his bicycle corps' trip, if suc- t
cessful, as it will undoubtedly be, i
will be considered one of the great- r
est achievements of daring and
pluck that have been accomplished t
in the army in the past few years: r
DUNNING, Neb., July 7, 5897.-
MY DEAR FATHER: If there is a
God-forsaken country, this is it
we are now right in the heart of
these abominable, infernal Ne
braska hills, where every mile we C
travel is like pulling so many teeth.
By almost superhuman efforts we l
can average about 35 miles a day,
as compared with a5 or zoo on i
good roads. As one of the soldiers a
said the other bight, "If I only get t
out of this place alive I'll have I
something to talk about as long as I
live". During the last few days we v
have had bad alkali water to drink, r
and the heat has been very intense. t
To-day the thermometer registers (
99 degrees in the shade. The p
health of the command, however, is
very good and I anticipate no f
trouble. We expect to get out of ]
the sand hills day-after-to-morrow,
and then we are just simply going i
to make the dust fly from our I
wheels. J
So far the trip has been a success,
although we have received some
very hard knocks-we have been
through a real campaign without
being shot at and that's all.
I expect to reach St. Louis some t
time between the zoth and 25th of
this month. I have offered a re
ward of $zoo to any man who can
cast a shadow the day we enter the 1
city.
You need not worry about my
breaking down; so far as the hard
ships are concerned, the trip is
nearly over, and what I lack in
physical strength I make up for in
ambition and determination. I
have always said this trip would
be a success, and so will it be.
With love to all, I am,
- Your loving son,
JAMES A. Moss.

State University Grounds.
We reproduce the annexed article
from the pen of Brother Bauer of
the Baton Rouge Bulletin. He
gives an historical synopsis of the
struggles attending the fight for
supremacy in the .Mississippi valley,
of France, England, Spain and
America, and incidentally those oc
curring on the grounds now occu
pied by the Louisiana State Univer
sity, the most historic spot in all
Lonisiana. These grounds for so
long a time the battle-ground of
those powers is now a site of learn
ing and a centre of advanced and
modern University work:
The site of the University is his
toric ground; over it hovers the
romance of the strugglei of the
Great Powers for supremacy in the
Mississippi Valley.
These extensive grounds and
splendid buildings, the princely gift
of our National government, were
occupied, successively, by the
armed battalions of France, Eng
land, Spain and America.
Here in 1779, Galvez, the Span
ish Governor-General of Louisiana,
after three days battle, captured
the British Garrison under Colonel
Dickson.
Here in 181o, Philemon Thomas
with his mixed band of Pine Woods
men and Ohio flatboat-men, cap
tured the Spanish Post, killing
Grandpre its commander, and
wresting West Florida from Spain.
Here nearly every prominent of
ficer of the U. S. Army, since the
Revolution did duty---Wilkinson
and the first Wade Hampton-Re
volutionary heroes, commanded
here; as did afterwards Gaines, and
Jessup, and Taylor, heroes of the
"war of g8a2."
Here Winfield Scott, the con
queror of Mexico, saw his first ser
vice as Lieutenant of Artillery.
Here Lafayette was received by
the military and citizens in 1824,
and Andrew Jackson later.
Here was the home of Zachary
Taylor, hero of Buena Vista, and
the birth-place of his brilliant son
"Dick," the distinguished Con
derate General.
Here in 186r, the Louisiana
State Troops-before the Secession
of Louisiana, took the garrison
and arsenal-with all its nmunitions
of war, from the U. S. Troops.
Here in x86z, General Breckin
ridge, commanding the Confeder
ates, fought desperate battle with
the Union Army and Navy under
Williams and Farragut-Williams
killed, and the Confederate Ram
"'Arkansas" blown up in full view.
Trodden were these grounds by
Grant and Lee, Sherman and
t "Stonewall" Jackson; by McClellan
and the Johnstons, Bragg and
IRosecrans; by Longstreet and Har
ney, George H. Thomas and Beau
regard; by Forrest and Phil. Sheri
dan, Hardie and Hood; by Han
cock and Custer, Admiral Porter
and Bishop-General Polk; and by
the great civilians Clay and Cal
houn, Abraham Lincoln and Jeffer
son Davis.

Public Schools.
At the recent convention of Par
ish Public School Superintendents
the committee on amendments to
the State Constitution made sev
eral suggestions which should be
come part of the new constitution.
One of the recommendations of the
committee is that the parish super
intendent be appointed by the re
spective Boards and whose salary
shall be fixed by the General As
sembly according to the tiumber of
educable children in the respective
parishes. Some of the other arti
cles refer to the enforcement of the
payment of the poll tax and the
permissioti to the teachers to give
instruction in the French language,
provided no additional expense is
incurred. We cannot publish all
the suggestions as made by the su
perintende.nts, but as a whole we
think they are perfectly wise and
should be put upon the stattte
books of the State. The sugges
tions concerning the raising of the
parish superintendent's salary es
pecially should be carried out, as
the amount now given him is en[
tirely too smalL
