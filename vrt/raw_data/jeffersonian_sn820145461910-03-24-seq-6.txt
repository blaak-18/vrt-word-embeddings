A NAMESAKE GONE—SAD CASE.
Dear Sir: —I enclose herewith an
obituary clipped from the Progres
sive Age, of Ruston, La. As you will
see, the young man was a namesake
of yours, and his father is one of
the best citizens of our county and
as staunch a friend and supporter of
Tom Watson as ever breathed. He
came here from your State about
twenty years ago. He has many
kindred and friends in Georgia, and
he asks that you publish the obituary
of his boy in your weekly Jefferson
ian, hoping thereby they may learn
of his sad bereavement.
Wishing for you long life and a
continuance of God’s blessings, I am
as ever,
Your sincere friend,
N. J. BELTON.

Obituary.
Died March 1, 1910, Tom Watson
Berry, at the home of his parents, C.
P. and Sallie E. R. Berry, in Lincoln
Parish, Louisiana, aged sixteen
years and three months.
He was a bright, intellectual,
promising boy; had been a con
sistent, faithful member of Pleasant
Hill Baptist church for four years;
was loved by the church and by his
many friends and companions in
school and the community in which
he lived, and in his last sickness he
gave the sweet assurance that he
was ready and willing to depart and
go to that bright* home in the Be
yond, if it was God’s will. His un
timely death has cast a gloom over
the entire community.
Resolved, therefore, by Pleasant
Hill church, That in the death of
young Brother Berry the church has
lost a faithful an«i promising mem
ber, and that the community has
lost one whose brief life gave prom
ise of much usefulness had he lived.
Resolved further, That we tender
to the bereaved parents and sorrow
ing brothers and sisters of our de
ceased young brother our profound
sympathy in this their hour of trial
and that we commend them to the
tender mercies of our God, and that
we all be submissive to His divine
will.

Comment.
It is with the deepest sympathy
that we publish the foregoing letter
and obituary; and we beg to add
our heartfelt condolences to the
family of this promising boy, cut
down on the threshold of life

WHAT IS THE AMOUNT PAID
• ELLIS?
Dear Sir:—Since reading the At
lanta Journal and what it said about
the “roasting” Mr. Ellis gave you, I
had thought to speak a word of en
couragement. I think he is afraid
that your expose of modern missions
will lessen the amount of “ducats”
going into the coffers of those offi
cials, and that would lessen the pay
he experts to receive on his next
trip into foreign lands to report
back to ns what great things men
and money are doing in the salva
tion of the poor heathens. The peo
ple that are mad at you as a rule are
the ones that are getting fat sala
ries and having a good time gener
ally. If the money should be taken
away from this mission system the
whole thing would burst like a “bub
ble” on the great sea. “Ye are not
redeemed with corruptible things,
such as silver and gold, but with the
precious blood of Christ.” The won
der is what became of the millions
of poor benighted, souls that were
turned into eternity before Cary and
Fuller conceived the idea of sending
the Gospel by men and and
called themselves modern mission
aries. If they were saved on ac
count of ignorance, then isn’t it
wrong to send the Gospel? But I
readily see how you were drawn into
this discussion, and I know how you
are persecuted for this righteous
task; but, thank God, you are able
to fight your own battle. You know
that Paul was a fearless man and an
inspired writer: and may you, like
Paul, when you have finished your
course, say, “The time of my de
parture is at hand, I have fought a
good fight, I have kept the faith.”
God can and will fight our battles if
we only trust and obey Him. Then
I contend that we are to fight, not
with fists of wickedness, but with
the Word of God. David and Gideon
are two great examples who ought
to prove to us that the battle is not
to the swift, neither to the strong,
and doesn’t consist in numbers nor
worldly power, but is altogether the
power of God executed by His own
sovereign will and purpose. Hope
you will excuse me for this in
trusion and remember that God has
given you your enemies into your
own hands, and I feel that you are
a just and devout man and will con
tinue to contend for Bible principles
and Bible doctrine regardless of
what puny man may say. And I
further believe that you will treat
your enemies well, and in the spirit
of the Master be able to pray,
“Father, forgive them for they
know not what they do.”
Yours for the right,
J. M. F. BARRON.

WHAT THE DISFRANCHISEMENT
LAW IS.
Dear Sir:—Please explain fully in
The Jeffersonian wherein the present
registration law in Georgia differs
from the disfranchisement measure
which was a part of the platform of
1906—the time when what-ye-call
’im Brown, (Popse, I believe), was
to run for Governor, and was pushed
out of the race by the “Large and
Beautiful”.
Your true friend and admirer,
W. B. SCREWS.
Answer.
The Disfranchisement law was an
amendment to our Constitution,
whose purpose was to put the ne
groes out of politics. The new reg
istration law. is an act of the Legis
lature to carry the amendment into
effect. But it is a bad law, in its
details, because it requires the voter
to register six months before the
election. The new law is defective
in some other details already stated
in The Jeff. T. E. W.
LAWRENCE BIRD AMPLY PRO
VIDED FOR.
Dear Sir: —Yours of the 7th inst.,
inclosing 45 cents in postage stamps
for the paralytic Lawrence Bird, has
been received and the stamps have
been turned over to his financial
agent.
Over one thousand letters are
awaiting answer at this time, so
great is the interest aroused in his
case. As soon as possible a circular
letter must be printed and mailed
each correspondent, for the burden
of correspondence has swamped my
wife and self, who are working vol
untarily in behalf of the invalid.
Yours truly,

WAGING A HARD BATTLE.
My Dear Sir:—This battle you are
waging for reform along the reli
gious lines is a strong, bold effort,
and while numbers would put you
out of business if they knew how,
there are those who appreciate the
fact that no reform movement is ever
waged without much opposition and
strife. And to attempt the thing you
have begun requires courage and
grit, and I am persuaded also some
good religion. God places His hand
upon one here and there to take the
initiative in some hard battle, and
that man I believe from early child
hood in some mysterious way is led
through many trials and temptations
which fit him for the work.
Whenever I look upon a photograph
of yourself I remark to my boys,
there is a tired man: awake to ijhe
evils that are at work to enslave us
and keep, as the expression is, our
“nose to the grindstone.” Yes, one
little man standing out against you
might save a world; and it matters
not where you may hit evil or ex
pose devils, they will cry out; some
of them are so possessed with this
evil spirit.
Like the man who dwelt among
the tombs cried out, I know who you
are, and what have I to do with thee.
But you must not stop here until
they begin to come out of the man.
Yes, they will be asking permission
to enter even into the swine.
I don’t write to flatter you, or if I
had any idea you in the least could
be selfishly waging this reform mere
ly to demonstrate your ability, I
would not write or refer to you or
any work you have done; but I am
fully persuaded there have been
hours when you stood alone plead
ing for your people and the common
good; when there was nothing but
the canopy of heaven above you, and
yet not alone, for the still, small
voice was heard. Then, in your hours
of meditation, when the hands on the
clock are pointing towards the hour
of twelve; may be you haven’t taken
time for supper—l can imagine you
laying down the pen, casting your
eyes toward ceiling, crying out,
Lord, what more can I do? I am
tired, and yet no place to rest. Ought
to go to bed and sleep, and yet may
be can not sleep. This is more than
I can bear. The field is white al
ready to harvest. Do send laborers
in the field; not the sort that fleece
thy people, laying burdens upon
them heavy to be borne, but not
willing to lift even with their fin
ger. Making long prayers, robbing
widows and orphans at their own
doors. Calling upon the poor wash
erwoman, looking over their glasses,
and asking the good sister how
much she is going to help, and how
much can he set her down to carry
on this wonderful work, while stand
ing beside her are maybe little tots
half naked who haven’t had a pair
of shoes all winter, and he, the
preacher, knew it. And when she
blushingly tells him she has nothing
to give now, he will insist until she
promises to set aside a missionary
hen, and he also impresses her that
she must give the best to the Lord,

A HINT FOR BROUGHTON, ET AL.
Dear Sir:—l presume that it is a
pleasure to you to receive a letter
from a young man who has read
your Life and Speeches, Story of
France, Napoleon, Waterloo, Bethany
and Political Economics, and who
reads your editorials, both weekly
and monthly, with increasing in
terest. Therefore, I ask no pardon
for intruding upon your valuable
time. I have just read your edi

Sinking Spells
Every Few Days
“At the time I began taking
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy I was
having sinking spells every few
days. My hands and feet would
get cold; I could scarcely
breathe, and could feel myself
gradually sinking away until I
would be unconscious. Those
about me could not tell there
was life in me. After these
spells I would be very weak and
nervous, sleepless and without
appetite; had neuralgia in my
head and heart. After taking
the remedy a short time all this
disappeared and in a few weeks
all the heart trouble was gone.”

For twenty years we have
been constantly receiving just
such letters as these. There is
scarcely a locality in the United
States where there is not some
one who can testify to the
merits of this remarkably suc
cessful Heart Remedy.
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy is sold by
all druggists. If the first bottle fails to
benefit, your druggist will return your
money.
