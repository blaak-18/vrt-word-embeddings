LETTERS E<HQM THE PEOPLE
FROM JUDGE WILLIAMS.
Vincennes, Ind., Oct. 27, 1908.
Aly dear Mr. Watson:
Prior to the election I wish to go
on record as being in favor of your
proposition to reorganize : nd push th ( ,
work.
You are authorized to sign my name
to any call you make and assured that
you will have my cordial co-operation.
Yours for Populism,
Samuel W. Williams.
Vincennes, Ind., Oct. 2, 1908.
My dear Mr. Watson: I hand you
herewith copy of today’s Vincennes
Sun, the local Bryan paper, and hope
it may reach you in time for use in
your speech of Saturday night.
The Bryan managers are using
<>very effort to rally the blacks in
Indiana to Bryan’s support.
This fellow Al lain is reported by
The Sun to be an ex-senator from
Illinois.
Illinois never had a black senator.
In his speech Allain said he was
from Louisiana, and to colored men
at a negro hotel here he said he was
from Tennessee.
When asked at this hotel, by a
black man, how a Southern negro
happened to be making Democratic
speeches, lie said he was receiving
Democratic money for so doing.
Prominent white Democrats turned
out in considerable numbers to hear
this fellow speak, and the use of the
court house was given to him. This
is a Democratic comity. The county
officers are all Democrats, and they
were all at this meeting and cheered
the black man lustily when he de
clared himself for equality of the
races and the election of Bryan and
Kern.
Today Democrats are claiming that
the black vote of this city will go
solid for the Nebraska wabbler.
Yours truly,
Samuel W. Williams.
WANTS A CONVENTION.
November 2, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson.
Dear Sir: I am pleased with your
proposition to call a conference im
mediately after the election is over
to rekindle the tires of liberty ami
wage a four years’ war on plutocracy
to the pulling down of the strong
holds of the privileged class and on
the ruins thereof build up true Jeffer
sonian Democracy.
I am in my 71st year and am very
feeble, having spent all the best days
of that time in the cause-of reform
(34 years), having* nexer faltered
even in the trying days of 1896. I
stayed right in the middle of the road,
while the hosts of plutocracy passed
bv on either side. 1 did not vote for
the peerless W. J. B. He has proved
to be just what I then thought him to
be, a traitor to the cause of reform;
a paid tool of trusts and combines, to
destroy the People’s Party. And be
did it; and with the money he got out
of the job he and his precious daugh
ter crossed the big waters. I think
we have got sucker on our string in
the person of Wm. R. IL If Mr.
Hearst had been a reformer as he
pretends to be he never would have
put out a national ticket, seeing we
had our ticket out already. All such
tricks have been and are still being
worked by the oppressors of the toil
ing millions of our once free Ameri
ca.
Let us take warning by the past
ami steer clear of all such break
ers, do our own work in our own way,
stand by our Populist guns, keep our
powder dry, take good aim and shoot
straight to the mark.
Dear Populist friends, let each and
every one of us shoulder our guns
and stand by our fearless leader,
Thos. E. Watson. Scatter the news
abroad; send the two Jeffersonians
into every nook and corner of this
United States; lire the woods and kill
the ticks. Every man (Populist) sub
scribe for the two Jeffersonians, and
send a half dozen to others. Thus
distribute the gospel of liberty and
my word for it, victory is ours in
1912. The work is ours and can be
done; let us hear from every Old
Guard in AimHea, write to the Jef
fersonian stating just how you feel
in the matter and what your resolu
tions are, what you can do, etc. I
moan what 1 say, and now, before I
forget it, I want to say to -Thos. E.
Watson, Don’t let my subscription
run out in the next four years, but
just notify me. Please change my
address from Cisco, R.F.D. .1, to Put
nam, Callahan county, Texas, and
oblige,
Yours in the fight for four years.
R. T. Short.
Putnam, Callahan county, Texas.
POLLS SHUT IN FACE OF
POPULISTS.
Dublin, Ga., Nov. 4,190 S.
Hou. Thomas E. Watson,
Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: Want io sav
to you that our parly is discouraged
and disheartened. In spite of. the
protest, at noon the managers rs the
polls stopped an hour and a ha’£ to
take dinner. They locked up the box
es in different rooms. When they
opened the rooms, one of the manag
ers was in with the boxes. We feel
sure that in Dublin district, Laurens
county, were polled 600 Populists, for
we know the men, but when the court
was made 190 was the number giver,
out for the Populists and nearly 6 (, 0
lor Bryan and it is a fact that there
are not more than 900 in all the coun
ty who are for Bryan. They counted
about 300 Populists over to Bryan.
This is Dublin district 1 write of.
Would be glad to hear from yon.
Yours respectfully,
Populist.
A POPULIST FOREVER.

October 13, 190 S.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson,
Dear Sir: I have the September
number of your Magazine, which I
received some time ago. It is just as
good as ever, and I have it going
around among the honest people,
teaching the principles of Justice,
<sbc 3effersonian
Truth and Liberty. I have not been
a subscriber for the last two years be
cause I did not have the moans and
because if my mail does not meet the
approval of Republican thieves, I am
never sure of getting it. I don’t
think that there is going to be any
chance to vote for you up here, but 1 •
am a Populist first, last and all the
time, and I don’t vote for what I
don’t want. There are a lot of people
that pretend to believe in Populist
principles, but they can never spend a
minute’s time or a cent of money to
help the cause. Damn such cattle. I
never have as much as I would like to
spend for that purpose, because I am
never well, and I can’t do much work.
I think the price of all Populist pa
pers and magazines should be raised
and get a little that way to help edu
cate the fools that don’t have brains
enough to think for themselves. Al!
true Populists will pay it so far as
they are able and the half-breeds are
generally better able to pay it thin
the others. This State has al wav<
been a great Republican stronghold
and today there are more thieves,
blackmailers, deadbeats and scabs to
Hie square inch in WisconYu ♦han
there in hell. This government is
run altogether for thieves; no honest
man need to expect anything from a
government that uses such infernal
villains as Harry Orchard, as a
witness against better men on trial
for their lives, and he doesn’t need
Io expect any more from a Presi
don that condemns such men before
I hey had their trial. One week from
today is the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November and the
fools that got skinned every time they
go to town will be rushing up to vote
for the same person that the skin
ners do.
Hoping that we may soon have a
government by and for honest men,
or a plague in place of the one we
have, something to kill off the infer
nal thieves by ivholesale.
I am respectfully,
Nelson Wickens.
Hon. T. E. Watson.
Dear Friend: Here is the vote of
our little county: Bryan, 88; Wat
son, 66; Taft. 21; Chafin, 1.
A lot of Watson men failed to
I urn out. Four years ago this" coun
ty gave you only 17 votes. I live in
Hip country*; have not heard how the
slate went; but I hope that results
are such as Io cause yon and your
followers to feel cheerful. God bless
our cause.
Your true friend,

IT 1 ■ ■ ■ . ■
FROM A FARMER BOY.
Contcr, Texas, Nov. 2,190 S.
lion. Thomas E. Watson,
Our Dear Leader and Patriot:
I write to let yon know how well I
appreciate you. I am a farmer boy
and have not had many advantages
of education, but I have been reading
your Magazine and 1 have grown to
love you. I read all I can from your
gifted pen. I have your 11 Story of
France,” and the “Life and Tinies
of Thomas Jefferson,” also your book
entitled “Life and Speeches.” I ap
preciate your books more than any
others and -want to get them before
our young men. I have just reached
the age Os 21, and I want all of our
young men who are reaching manhood
to know something of you and the
principles for which you stand, ami I
know when one gets to reading from
the pen of Tom Watson, he is hungry
for more and feels the enthusiasm
just as I have, if they want to see
justice prevail. I think if you will
send me some of your Magazines, I
can sell them here, and will do so and
send you the money. I would send
the money in advance, if I had it. You
can send me a lot of about thirty an 1
the price for which they sell.
We have some Tom Watson clubs
out here and we are going ahead un
daunted and organize Populist clubs
and we are going to run our county
officers next two years.
Yours for Populism,
Duke Sanford.
RE-ORGANIZE OUR PARTY.

herewith enclosed, please place the
undersigned on your Weekly Jeffer
sonian subscription list.

tion and reorganization of the Popu
list party and Omaha platform prin
ciples in due accord with your edito
rial announcement, “Keeping a
Promise and making an Appeal,” in

To my children, and their children,
especially, and further to my native
country, is this subscription dedicated.
Yours sincerely from all theyears

FOR A “JEFFERSONIAN”
PARTY.
Brunswick, Ga., Nov. 4, 1908.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
My dear Sir and Friend* The elec
tion is over, and Ihe result meets my
entire approval. It demonstrates that
a mongrel concern, although under an
old and honored name, can not de
ceive. The Democracy (?) has cer
tainly defuncted this time, and now
is Hie time, in my humble judgment,
for action. Do you not think that it
would be well for us to completely
reorganize, and under the name “ Jef
fersonian Party?”
Shakespeare said, “A rose by an
other name would smell as sweet.”
True, but in this case, I firmly be
lieve that adopting for Hie name of
our party the name of the man upon
whose principles it stands would be
right and proper, and it would per
haps take away the carefully culti
vated stigma of “Populist.” The
mongrel democrat is certainly blessed
with two things, namely, ignorance
and impudence; but I believe the
