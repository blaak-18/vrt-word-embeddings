A lexandria , L a ., Sept. 9 74.
Mr. Editor :
D ear S ir — Î linvo casually learned
that the petition I recently signed,
fnvors a gratuitous loan of Three Hun
jdred 'fiions, und Dollar» to the conteni
I plated rail road t.» Shrcveport, by this
Parish.
I wish to say that I heedlessly sign
ed the petition without reading it, and
now desire t.o qualify the net. as fol
lows: I atn by no menus in favor of
taxing either the State or any portion
theroof, without a quid pro quo.
If the Company proposing to build
the road lo Shrereport, wislicB to give
the Parish first mortgage bonds for this
advance or security, then I would fa
vor the act, not otherwise. The truth
is, that the travel nnd commerce of the
Red River Valley are ample to pay
any Canipany from its very incipiency
To ask a donation is simply a scheme
of capitalists, to fleece this community.
I ain in favor of all legitimate rail
road enterprises, hut the history of the
North as well as every other country,
has shown that monopoly is the crying
evil of the day, nnd especially touching
railroad matters.
The organization of the Grange lo
suppress this grievance, is simply a
hint. Why not heed it, and avoid the
«»vil (hat other countries have been led
into, and now regret. I simply quali
ty my signature thus, although I am in
favor of legitimate railroad enterprises.
Yours Truly,
J. E. WALLACE.
