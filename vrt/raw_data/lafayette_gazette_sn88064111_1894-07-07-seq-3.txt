Some of our people will remember
that about six years ago there passed
through this place a tribe of Apache
Indians and their famous chief, the
warlike Geronimo, who were cap
tured by the United States troops in
Arizona and sent to Fort Marion,
Fiorida, and placed under surveil
lance. After becoming somewhat
civilized, the government decided
to take them in the army and make
soldiers of them. Monday evening
about sixty members of the once
blood thirsty tribe passed through
Lafayette on their way to FortKeogo,
Arizona. Those who had seen them
six years ago were surprised to see
the transformation from a wild
Indian to a civilized soldier of the
United States.

The Arabs In Court.
Last Tuesday morning the whole
Arabian population of Lafayette was
in the Mayor's court. Two of these
worthies were arrested for fighting
and disturbing the peace and fined
each $7. which was readily paid.
The people of Lafayette welcome
the right kind of immigrants, but
these Arabian peddlers are becom
ing too numerous and it is to be
sincerely hoped that their present
number will decrease instead of in
creasing.

FALL OF THE BASTILLE.
Celebration of the Great French
Fete - Orations, Fire-Works,
Etc., at Beausejour Springs.
Lafayette did not do like many of
its neighbors on the Glorious Fourth,
but on the Fourteenth of July she
will "celebrate in grand style." A
number of gentlemen are eaznestly
at work making elaborate prepara
tions to do honor to the memory of
the French patriots who, on July 14,
1789, captured the historic prison
and razed it to the ground.
There will be, on Saturday, July
14, an immense picnic or fair at the
Beausejour Park, which will be
opened to the public from 7 o'clock
in the morning until midnight. The
gentlemen whose names appear on
the committees below have expressed
their willingness to do everything in
their power to make this the most
brilliant affair of its kind ever given
in Lafayette. The money realized
will be used to build an annex to
the public school building and also
to build a plank walk to the High
School. These two things, we all
know, are sadly needed and com
mend themselves to all our people.
Free transportation will be given
to everybody wishing to visit the
fair grounds. In the morning there
will be a processsion in wagons,
starting from the court-house, of
the school children of the town and
parish, who will all be admitted free
to the grounds, provided, of course,
that they participate in the proces
sion, which will be headed by a
brass band. At the park dinners
and lunches will be served during
the whole day, thereby enabling
families to spend the day on the
grounds. Good music will be on
hand and those fond of dancing will
have ample opportunity to amuse
themselves as the platform will be
given exclusively for the use of the
dancers.
An address will be delivered in
French by Judge F. Voorhies, of
New Iberia, and Judge Allen of St.
Mary, will speak in English. Other
distinguished gentlemen will deliver
addresses.
All those who wish to go to the
fair are requested to report at the
court-house square where convey
ances will be in readiness at all
h ours.

A BRILLIANT CLOSE.
The Mt. Carmnel Convent Holds
its Closing Exerinses-Hun
dreds of Premiums and.
Some Pretty Medals
Awarded
This has been a prosperous year
for the Mount Carmel Convent.
Never has this well-known school
closed a more successful term.
Every year marks an increase in its
iufluence for good in our town and
parish. That the people are proud
of this excellent institution and ap
preciate the good work of the
kindly sisters is evidenced by the
liberal support extended by them.
No better recommendation of this
school can be desired than the young
ladies who leave its doors.
As per announcement in our last
issue Monday was the commence
ment day at the convent.
Owing to the fact that the sisters
had given a public entertainment
some weeks ago the exercises con
sisted only of an opening address
and the distribution of premiums.
Miss Celeste Thibodaux delivered
the opening address which follows:
Venerated Pastor, Honored Friends, Kind
Teachers and Dear Companions.
The ringing of the bell at length ushers in
the morning which brightens up the walls of
our Convent School, every thing wears a
holiday garb announcing the welcome vaca
tion day. The joyous voices and happy
recollections of home give one and all the
endless diversion of merry and eager hopes.
But the usual routine of life is this: the
brightest of hopes are drawn back, when
casting one long lingering glance behind and
with apprehensions of fear in our breast that
our happiest days have been spent.
Our kind teachers have often warned us
against the mistaken frivolity and self com
placency of the world. Dear,kind,sisters how
can we acknowledge with expressions of
gratitude all our indebtedness to you.
Our hearts overflow with boundless thanks,
and never will cease to echo the like feelings
for our dear Convent school in which we
have been provided with an ample provision
of credit, honor and responsibility.
Another beneficent hand has reared reli
gion in our hearts. Venerable and beloved
Pastor, your presence renders brighter still
this festival day. You have ever been to us
a gleam of light in our dark path, your
worthy lessons will ever counterbalance a
thousands volatile propensities in our nature.
We promise you to do all in our power to
answer to your anxious hopes.
Honored gentlemen, we trust you will
receive our thanks; your worthy pen a few
weeks ago manifested itself in our favor.
May it ever serve as a cheering stimulus to
the exertion. of our good teachers.
Miss Marie Revillon was the only
graduate ot the class of '94. This
bright young lady is the daughter
of Mr. Pierre Revillon. She has
always shown much proficiency in
her studies, having always had the
honor of being one of the best and
most studious members of her class
since her entrance into the school.
WVe regret not being able to publish
her valedictory address. It was
delivered in French, and we are
sincerely sorry that we cannot give
it to our readers. At the conclu
sion of Miss Revillon's, address,
Rev. Father Forge spoke to the
girls. The reverend .gentlman de
livered a short, but touching ad
dress. His eloquent words went to
the hearts of his listeners. The
beloved pastor then gave out the
medals and premiums, after which
all repaired to the beautiful chapel
of the convent where services were
held and the act of consecration
was said by Miss Revillon.

To Issue Bonds for Waterworks.
As will be read in the proceedings
of the Town Council a petition
signed by citizens was presented to
that body asking it to call upon the
Legislature to pass an enabling act
giving the town the power to issue
bonds for the purpose of construct
ing a system of water works. It is
unfortunate that this step was not
taken sooner, as the Legislature
will adjourn next week, and as it
has its hands full with other busi
ness more important to the State at
large it is not likely that the act
desired by the citizens of this town
will be passed.
The best grades of flour at prices

Wantetd to be Crenmated Alive.
Last Monday morning a country
man who had indulged too freely in
strong drinks was locked up in the
calaboose. A few minutes later
screams were heard from the jail.
A crowd of men were soon on the
grounds to see what was the matter.
From the smoke coming out of win
dows of the jail, it was evideht that
the building was on fire. No time
wvas lost and the doors were thrown
open which revealed the cause of
the screams of drstress emanatings
from the room occupied by the jag
ful countryman, who had set fire to
two or three quilts which he had
rolled together. WVhat was his object
in committing such a foolhardy act
no one can tell. He was dragged
out just in time, and it is safe tI, say
that he ca ine out of the cralhahl,'
a wiser if not a richer roan.
