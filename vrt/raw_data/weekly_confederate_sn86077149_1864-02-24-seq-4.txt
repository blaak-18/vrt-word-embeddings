of the 17th was pat in heed, we received the
FayetteTille Obaerrrr - with a leader on the

'that sorb Id 'assemblage is wholly snnecessa
rJ rwonld be attended with nowise political
; agifatiorrecrsf irate additional elections, and
"' wobld inrolwe expenditure entirely dispropo-
tioned to any gotd it could accomplish. The
Imam rurpce row announced ia, that' this
body is to counsel scd adrlse the Confederate
GoTerument and otherwise aid it to prose
cute the war. What counsel could it furnish,
that the Legislature cajujot as wejl bestow?
They are both representatives of the people:
both elected in the same way, and both hodies
are likely to be a mpesed of Tety much tbe
same-sort cf material. So far as counsel
concerned, i;her the Convection nor the
Legislature could pass any ordin4nce er act
meir acucn ccuiu noi rise me sryie oi eitner
an organic cr Legislative law. The most
either could do, must Ve dece by way of reso
lations; and, tie rcsolutictg cf the latter, as
the exponent of the public sentiment, would
hare equal weight with tLos-e of the former.
So far as negotiations for peace areconcerned,
the President baa three times endeavored to
make thrm ; std Us efforts have iecn'eon
tr.melicusly rejected and there is positive
evidence,- that any preposition now vcould
sjiare the same fate ;Tt r Lincoln hiscself, and
bis vthole Congress, haTe declared hat. they
w ou!d rcceire -no terms short of reconstruction
J- and the majority refuse even this with
Lincoln at its head. On what ether subject
could a Convention advise? The Confede
rate Government has letter for.rces of infor
mation in every State, than members of a
Convection ccuTd possibly be.- It has the
G overnor of each S"ute, with all his means
the Legislature with tfceirs.and its own officers
posted in various lot alters. Snppoce the
system were rd. pted that the common Gov
rnrnent is to discard these easy and natural
mot'.es of information, and ConventfoDs were
convoked ly the different Statcs.to set asadvi-
sers of tie Government I What a ' melee
we ahouM soon have. Here would be an
advis sry m meDt from JScith Carolina, rp
rtsrdj'frc m South Carolina, amended by
Georgia, with a sultitute from Alabana
a j ir us and coLfliotirg eounsels, as interest,

would provtkr and the common Govern
ment, insteaef of being allowed to wa'k by the
liht of its owu Teason. would be obliged to
grope its way to harbor through these devious
channels. The project is idle and worthless.
Nor is it likely, in the present station in
North Carolina, that the body would be com-
;pnfed cf n-atorial either capable of, or inclined
to, give whoVscn e advice. If ibe present
T.eoru.!ature is sn v 11 er:rr,en of what, the

labor would biir-g frth, -Oi.l forbid that the
StatfKiiM M.fftr ruch sfliction. Now;
the- last Legislature Lad it in its power to do
important servhetotle Cor.fedrracy not in
the way ofadvice.but of action. One mr-de was
t-i pa.s an act tuthorixirg the Governor to
employ the Home Guard to arrest deserters ;
another was to allow him or the Chief Justice
on his request, to call the Supreme Court to
settle vexed qnrt:on9Both of these were
recommended and urged by theG vernor, and
they were specially desired by the Confederate
Government these ttco pieces f practical
$ercice. . Deserters from the army were
mnkinp thi St3tea city of relug they came
from all the States, under the invitation ex
tended by the VcisKn that the Home Guard
coujd n t be called out to arrest them. They
wrjeoiit lying in the. wo ds and committing
all manner of depredatloas. A Brigade had
to be sent from the army, to overawe and
cat h them t a lime, too, vrhf-n troops could
but ill be spared.
With all the influence of the Governor
- M
tnd all the exertions cf ti e wiser and more
practical of the merrfbers si; vas with great
difficulty that any.law was jned on the sub
ject ; and then the Govert. r was restricted
to callfng them from the c unty in which
I the deseilers were, and those adjacent, so that
a body of deserters had naiJVjht to do, but to
pass into a county not adjacent to those called
$n. in order to set the whole jMjwer of the
Governor at dt fiance. Thus in th's instance,
wheu North Car.iLM legislation might hate
aided the Govornrmeiit, it only supjd'ed a bro
ken staff on -which he who leant must Ml. The
result was that the Confederate Government
was obliged, and is still, to 'hold a, large

HaleighyStandard, lebrva'ry 27, 1863-
Under tle head ot The WTar," the New
YorkTribune of the 1st inst, has the follow
ing paragraph : . "
From Newbern we have further particulars
of "the rapidly increasing feeling of discon
tent in North Carolina. The people are urg
ing the call of a State Convent ion, and Dr.
Leach, one of. tbe recently elected members
of tbe Rebel Congress, says through the IUI
eigh Staudard, that North Carolina now claims
the fulfillment of the compact or the right to
depart from tbe Confederacy in peace. Got.
Vance opposes tbe tftatioa of State projerty
by tbe Rebel Government. The Raleigh
Standard, in an article addressed to slave
holders, says if tbe war continuestwelve
months longer, the institution of slavery will
be destroyed. -
We call the attention of our late sacceasfu
coofpetitor, Dr. Leach, (whosefprototype was
T. Hardy, Secretary to the " London Corres
ponding Society'' 1794 afterwards Thomas
Hardy, prisoner in the dock of Old Baily,)-i
to the Ctide above quoted. It is taken from
the New York Tribune. That paper says,
i hat "Dr. Leach, one of 4he recently ected
members of "the Rebel Congress, say through
the Raleigh Standard, that North Carolina
now claims the fulfillment of the compact,
or the right to depart from the Confederacy
in peace." Thus, one of the Yankees whom
Dr. Leach calls " brethren " in one of his cir
culars, dees not mistake the Doctor's language, .
but construes it for himself, an ; publishes it
to the North as another evidence of the "rap-,
idly increasing feeling of discontent in North
Carolina." ' - -.
Horace Greely to Brother Leach, grseting :
While the Confederate CX mmissKaier in Rich
mond is engaged in trying one Mrs. Patterson
Alien for only betraying the "family where
he resided, and communicatiug privately
with the enemy here jn Noith Carolina, a
member elect to Congress, denouuees to the
enemy,-to our soldiers aud pewple, that our
whole Government is a despotism, towards
which " lorbearance is no longer a virtue
that now "North Garoliue claims the fulfill
ment of tLe compact or the right to depart
in peace." Tbus, " increasing the feeiing of
discontent" advising the rupture of the
government, and "aiding and comforting the
enemy." Is there no Commissioner in North
Carolina ? The whole case would turn ouuk-
ly ou a common' sense cohfctructiou of admit
ted publications.
We record with great pleasure the'follow-
ing tribute to the distinguished onicer in
whore honor it is, bestowed. We know Geul.
Rodes well have seated with him and uuder
him his division consisting ia a large meas
ure" of North Carolina Brigades. It takes
none of his acquaintances - by surprise that
he obtained promotion bv " distinguished
illactry ; and thaf his " skill and conduct"
should attract observation. Gen. Rods com
bines the. elements of an officer in most admi
rable proportions. "He is a 3isciiliparian
firm, but un oppressive eyeful of the c-m-
forts of his men and strict 'in his exactions of
duty. On the battle field he handles his com
mand with excellent discretion always ma
king it tell with effect whether it be a Regi
ment, Biigade, or Division. And his bold Ala-
bamians they have been our neighbors on
bloody fields they comprise; the best spirits
of iheirJStat. and their march on the enemv
has been laid heavy and thick. May God de
fend them and our own North Carolinians as
they fiht side by side they mats a noble
brotherhood. Ia at the beginning, determin
ed to the end. When the ereat dav of de-
Hverance shall come, a grateful coon' ry will
swell to grandeur the jubilee of their wel
come home.
Gik. Robert E. Ri?ies The Richmond
correspondent of the Montgomery Adverser,
speaking of Gen. Lee's compliments to Bit
titj Brigade, quotes Gen. Lee's ewn words
revive to the gallant young Major General
who so ably commands the Division t which
Battle's brigade belongs, and recalls. the fact
that Gen..R. owes his promotion to Geu.
Stonewall Jackson. Gen. R.xles has com
manded his division with success and ability,
and I nm gratified to state this division has
re-enlisted for the War, Battle's brigade of Al
abandans having set the example. Ins ead of
raising new brigades, I think it would be far
better to Tecruit to the fullest numbers those
veteran brigade? whose whole conduct is wor
thy of the admiration of their country n en."
To which the correspondent of the - Adver
tiser adds the following- additional quotation
from UiC same high authority : '
Gen. Lee, speskTug ot-the division in the
san,e communication, aya: " Gen. Rutlt.' di
vision aetrd at Chaneellorsville with distin
tinguished gallantry, aud that officer owes
Jiis pn nKtion to General Jackson's observa

,; The Address of Kef .Br. Lacy.
Tbe first address -of this able divine fins'
true patriot, at the Ct nminns Hall, ou thp
evening, of the 16th, is roportsl to us as a
splendid effort full of earnest, heart-stirring
soft soul-inspirirg eloquence. It taught the
duty the dtizen'owes Jo his country it en
forced the obligations to its fulfillment, snd
it cheertd the po:mer by the assurance of
that favor of tbe goxd God which is the re

such a source, must uefds prtKince good. It
sheds a double light cpon our darkened path

ments of our armies in the field with regret
that our navy has been able to but feebly
second those noble efforts. The heroic deeds
or our Buchanan, Semmeseaud Maffit only
illustrate what we might accomplish, had we
a good navy. It is not for, me to say wber;
the responsibility lies that this arm of oui d

'marked, will bethe duty of tbe historian ot

facts in connection with maritime history, and
to show therefrom the importance to the Con
federacy of a good marine More than three
thousand years ago au eminent writer made
us of the following language : - .
" All mankind arm themselves against those
who usurp the empire of the seas, as against
enemies'of the humau race."
If at thaj eajfly day the marine was con
sidered thus important, horn much more so
now, when modern improvements have ren
dered it tenfold more formidable? The
Almighty, in commanding Noan to build nu
Ark, whereby be and his family were saved
while a world was being destroyed, 'seems to
have Indicated wherein lay the wafetyaud
strength oi people. From the days ofth-t
patriarch, down to the present time, the
marine has been tt eTright arm and the glory
of nations. The Naval battle of Acteum
-delivered into the hands of Aagu:
Caesar, the empiie of thet.world. The
small States f Genoa aad " enice rose from
poverty and insignificance to riches ai d power
through their marine, i be form dar;e squad
rons of Spain in the 16th century enabled her
to dominate in the New-as well as in tbe Old
.World. The States' of Holland,-whose inhab
itants, originally fleeing from religious perse
cution, had settled down ami. the marshes
that border the German Ocean, became power
ful through their maritime ascendancy. Prior
to ihe reiri of Elizabeth, England played but
a secondary role in European affairs. ' The fit
ting out by Spain ot the formidable armada,
destined tor her subjugation, flr3t gave jmpulse
to the genius and energy or her "Virgin
Queen." Then was laid the foundations of
tnat colossal power upon theneas w.hich, in ita
fdl, would shake the world aud in defence of
which Canning has said, E 'g aod, if aeeeaSarv,
"would uribar their caves and let loose the
winds." It is instructive and at ihe same
time amusing, 'to-trace the rise and pr-rtss of
that immense Colossus. .Nothing better ilius-
i rates the depth aud strategy of English states

efforts were directed in chasing, from the seas
the Spatii.--li Squadron. Having accomplished
that, she drops her ally and ttiend. and by a
coalition with her ancieut rivsU and enemy,

vimie European powers nfi.be inumciency of
the enemy s blockade. In -twelve months, or
less time, we m ght have a fle f of boats which
would not only make day light through- the
blockade, but poss'.bly enable us to regain
possession of the entire sea coast of this State.
But if the Government cannot do this, is there
not a sufficient amount of individual enter

that which the liovernment tails to do 7
About the commencement of tje last century

3fV. Editor :' Just say to the i soldo at home,
as a word df encor.grmeut,,that fhia regiment,
(war-wt in, and vvitn -ranks di-enrmnatfd by
t he casulties of battie) has re-en lifted for tho
war.- The far faml ret utatbm it has won by
its u-.fiitjchiur devotion to the cause veTiica it"
so eagerly and early espoused, has been c ijw I
by this its most brilliant deed ol tbe war. iv -
carriless of the privations aud hardship? it Ims
experienced fr the last three years, .tho
brave heart comprising it are uot ready to
'lay down their arms, and tur their hck
upon the colors they have so nobly borne on
many a hard iotight 6eld Trace them from
Hanover C. II. to Gettys'iurg, and you will
gee no nobler deeus enacted than what they
hare done. Yet al lathis, has been crowned
by this, Iheir most brilliant h at. It is i ot a
triumph over a dastard foe, but ov.r thetn-
sslves, the greatest of human achievements.
By this act. they have addefj the brightest
stai to that maguifict-nt chaplet that now
crowns their banner. ' Tney have spoken w. rds
of encouragement to the people at .hometjtet-
ling ti e faiut-he; ted t . be of good chef r, and
to skulkers, that thir day of retribution is
fast approaching : and at the same time hurl
ing dehauce at that enemy that would dare
to devastate our borne This proof of their
devotion tnour cause, tlair dcterminatiin to
be free or die, is worthy of commendation,
and speaks well for tbe old North Stale:, re
gardless ot that obnexious sentiment that
prcvades some portion.of her territory. Soruo
may, and doubtless will say, that the men
were compulsed, but is untrue and is irratitig
those brave meu with injustice. This sn tho
first aud only, regiment from the State to
Lre - enlist for the war before the passage o the
conscript law, and the meunislike very much
to be called conscript regiment. Ali that is

.This morning a bestiful phenomenon, nd
one of rare occurrence, was to be neen on tho
bay, which presented the appearance of a
boundless ocean, with the waves dancing and
sparkling in the sunshine as far as tr e e e
cou:d reach. Not a cloud wa to 6e swn
above tbb vast extent of water ; the blue sky,
terminating in abeautifully defined border,the
line of which was accuratrly developed, alone
b uuded the distant view ; and so complete
wasthe optical iilusi -n that it was impossible,
f'.-r some leng'h of UtnK to imagine anything
ele than the sea itself had. by some unac
countable means, actually risen above .its
natural level, overflowed the islands and cov
ered, the .hills. Nathing could exceed tho
effect of this beautiful miragwhicH Jasted
for some time ; and then, as if by magic, , tbe.
yoliiiue of misty vapors in a mass rolled it

Tha Wilratpgton Journal pifblishea a high
ly interesting aceoubt of tbe movrmeut of
tbe force which - left Wilmington under com
rriaod .of Brigadier General Martin, to co-operate
in the rcceut demonstration against New
bern. It gives us very great pleasure to cor-J
roborato the" statements of the Journals cor
respH.ckit. Geueral'Martiu. with the gallant
officers and men under his command, accorn-
Iis'ied all and more than had been assigned to
them, and if blame attach auywiere for the
comparative failure of ' the oorjahiued movo-
tfuts, none of that blame can attach to Gen
Martin or the brave little" srrry uuder his c m
mend. Erom all we'have been able to learn
from different souces we sre eonvinctdT.hat
Generals Clingman tnd Hoke also performed
their part well aud bravely.
Ucg etting the necessity of selection and
o:ui-aion, we present sueh portions as will be
motit interesting to bur readers :
The expedition consisted , f the 17tb North
Carolina Kegim jit, Lieutenant - Colonel John
C. Lamb, commanding ; the 42ud Kcgiment,
North Carolina Troops, ' Colonel John L.
Brown, cmmandi sg ; Captai u Paris' (Virjain-
ia) Battery oQ Artillery, and (Japtain t,IUs
Battery of Mdor J. W. Mre's Battalion of
Aillery; aud fo compaides of cavalry
Captain Harris and Captain Harland th-
liite from South Carolina.
Too xpeditiuii moved from Wilmington on
the 28 h ult.yand mae an average march of
tweHiy ii-iles a day over heavy sandy roads at
this end of the line, and deep muddy ones at
the O' her. No remar.kab'e incidVnt occurred
until our forces approached the enemy' liue,
when General Martin disposed his forces as
follow: Au advanced guard, Consisting of
all the cavairy, three companies of infantry,
and one of artillery, was th&jwn forward to
" fed" th enemy the cavalry being under
the immediate command of Lieutenant Colo
nel II. J. Jeffords, 6th South Caro ina Cavalry,
and the whole under command of Col. George
Jackson. 'The rest of the infantry and artill
lery followed under the immediate supervision
ol the Cinmanding General. On nearing the
firt picket of the enemy and ducovcrisig
tbewj on the alert, the cavany da-hed furiously
forwanl, and.the Yankee" picket (twenty-live
or thirty in number) retreated as last as their
-horses would carrv them. The load over
wliioh pursuers snd pursued had to ass was
through a swamp, and full of. deep holes
overflowing with mud and water. But on
they sped .-oii.b of the Yankee horses and
their ridos tuinim? somersets in the mud, and
ours running over them, and tumbling head
long inte the deep mire alter them, inflicting
many bru:ws upOu the men and bor6A, (break
lug the'tieck of one of trie latter) t ut. doing
no serictib llamas to the ruhr. It was at
this point that Lieut' Mm, of Hams' cavalry,
while gallantly leading the charge, fe! I -mortally
w.u. de-d by a pis'ol shot from a Yankee
who was Iwing liotly pursued.
Besides the capture of prisoners, about
twenty "of the "enemy were killed most of
their wounded being carried off the field.
After diivin thcin through the vods, and
over the held intervening between our troops
ai d the fort (rvt w.por.t IrJarrai k), tbe enemy
opened on us with a 42-pound, r from the.krt.
Captain Paris delivered a few weil directed
si.o s a them fiofu his 12-pound Napoteon,
when, tin; General detrriined to assault the
works wish iufautry SVirmishers werethrowu
forward, but on their appearance, the en my,
liavit g previ- usly set fire to 11 the building?,
evacuated the' place, set fire to the ra 1 road
bridge, aial tore up the com-ty brioge over
Newport nyer to prevent pursuit.- it was
now night, and after a running fight of six
hours, over the dis'auce of' eight miles, our gal
lant troops were in p'bse.-siou ofthAield the
ene'nydi ing for- life. Altogether, our troops
captured pevt-u pieces of artdery, several bun
died stand of arms, two hundred boxes amu
nition. . bout serV-ty ive prisoners, six slaves,
a dzeo horses, and commissary' stores enougi
to snbsistjhe tro-ips during their stay 'u tho
i.eighborhocKl, besides a liTge quantity of
ciothif g with Which our men supplied them
selves such . as overcoats, pants, blanket-,
crc. The enemy burst most of their quarter
master and commissary stores. frhey also
burnt their stables with the horses in them
Some few horses were. rescued by iur mn. Iu
additi n to our cirjituns. we destroyed one
ttionsand barrels of turpentine belonging to
the United States Government and burnt two
jaii ro-jd bridges.
The next morning the General directed Col.
J fiords, with a ch tachmert of 60 'cavalry,
to mnkc a reconnoisnce in the vicinity of
Isewfcern not having oeafd fmui our forces
there, aud being in entire ignorance as to th
inoveiiients of our troops.
This work was thmoughfy accomplished..
