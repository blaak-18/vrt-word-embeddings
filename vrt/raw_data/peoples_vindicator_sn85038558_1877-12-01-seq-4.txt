ieg. Why Farming Does Not Pay.
itgs
ottl- The impfression has gone abroad
and throughout the laud, that falingii
ioll does not pay, and this imprecssion is
-e of fast gaining grlound among the farm- t
Joy's ers especially of the South.
But the iquestion mayi be asked, I
iot- whetiher the wasteful and extrava- e
Sgant method of farming, together
104 withl the inattentionll to tusiiess, aind
rue the t rustig of work too muchlll to
hired labor, has not something to I do
o's in the matter. We couhl cite many r
Sinsti(anceS where farmet s who have at- F

hiave conflicting view s on this impor- t
ttaut sunject, when theories are built
npon mere "guess work" tand concl
of 5sios arrived at form false premises.
,as- A good deal that makes up the cur- P
lent reading in our best agritcltural °
ing jpapers, is opinion rather than stab
on horn fact. Some farmers are incapa- q
ing hle of making w CtIrato expe*inlellts,
becausel they will not weigh all the
lost circumstances connected with them,
ced and because they allow firejudcei to
sod warp facts. They do not seek to
