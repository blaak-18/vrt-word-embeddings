RACE FOR A BRIDE.
T was in those days
when Sharp's island,
which divides the mouth
of the Choptank and the
Chesapeake bay, was
the site of three large
farms of more than four
hundred acres. But the
ceaseless roll of the
tides of the bay and river on the two
sides and the numerous ice gorges of
the northern rivers of the bay have
caused the island to be worn away to
a mere shadow of its former self.
The lighthouse, which is now more
than a half-mile away from the north
ern end of the island, was then on
solid ground, one hundred or two hun
dred yards from the water. But the
Choptank has not been changed.
It is still one of the most picturesque
rivers in the state. In fact, it puts
one more in mind of the interior of a
West Indian island than that of a
middle Atlantic state. The growth of
vegetation is so luxuriant and dense
that in some cases it is with great difil
culty that passage is made in going
through the woods which line its bank.
The water is of a beautiful dark blue
and has that freshness and saltness of
air about it which is only possessed by
the ocean itself.
On this particular day the sky was
radiant with flooded sunshine, and a
gentle breeze was blowing redolent
with summer's fragrances. There was
a delightful calmness on the river and
bay, which persuaded one to spend his
time in idly dreaming. A number of fish
ermen were indulging in this occupa
tion under the shady trees after several
hours of sport. Suddenly from one
end of the island came a swiftly-rowed
boat, in which were a nuinber of
young people, steered by a benevolent
and elderly-looking man. Closely fol
lowing, and seemingly in pursuit of it,
came a second boat, streered by a
middle-aged man, and propelled by
two sturdy young men.
"Well! If there ain't Nellie Barnes
and Dick Wilson running away to get
married!" exclaimed one of the fisher
men.
"And there goes old man Roche,
Nellie's stepfather. in pursuit. Now,
won't Rome howl?"
"'I bet on the lovely bride!"
"And I on the stern parent!"
"Come, boys, come! Jump into the
boat and let's see the fun out."
Dick Wilson's father had died some
years ago, and left his son a fine farm
of one hundred and fifty acres. Ad
joining the Wilson farm was that of
John Roche. For years there had been
bad blood between the neighbors. It
was all on account of a point of land
projecting into the Choptank. Both
Wilson and Roche claimed it, and when
it was taken to law, it was decided in
favor of Wilson. About two years ago
Roche married a pretty widow named
Barnes. She had a daughter whose
name was Nellie. It was love on the
first sight when Dick and Nellie acci
dentally met in the church on the
mainland. From that time on the
affection grew stronger. They fondly
thought that no one knew it but them
selves, but they were mistaken, for
Mr. oehe had seen it at the very
start sd tried by every means tokeep
them separated.
Bat lose will always find a way.
TDck aud Nellie put their heads to
gther one Sunday at church and
ag.eed to rn away and get married on
the sly. Aed what wsa more fortunate

He seemed perfectly cool, and ever
And anon, by means of a large bundle
which held the all-important veil and
wreath, tried to assure and comfort
Nellie with numerous squeees of the
hand and endearing words, which he
fondly thought were not seen. But
such was not the case. For the gig
gling, sharp-eyed bridesmaids, *who
were seated in the bow of the boat,
discovered them. They revealed their
knowledge- by numerous outbursts of
laughter in the intervals left from
charmning the young rowers by their
conversation.
The good parson was the elderly
man, and he it was who would tie the
knot. He at in the stern, steering
with studied precision.
And as the second boat approached,
Mr. Roche arose from his seat, and
cried.with a string of oaths:
"What do you mean, Dick Wilson, by
stealing my girl?"
"I'm not stealing her." Dick replied.
"She comes of her own free will, and
with her mother's consent. You've
nothing against me in reason, and, be
sides, she's of age."
This was followed by outbursts of
laughter and hurrahs from the boys in
the boat. The only thing Mr. Roohe
did was to glare and swear. After re
covering himself, he finally said:
"I have this against you. that you're
your father's son, and you'll not have
Nell. I'm the head of the house.
Come out of that boat, Nell, or I'll
shoot."
At these words he leveled a shotgun
at Dick. Nellie screamed with- terror.
"Oh! Dick, let me go to him or he will
kill you!"
"He'd like to, no doubt," said Dick,
"but he's afraid of shooting the rest,
and, besides, he's too much of a cow
ard. Do you think Ill give you up,
darling, with the happiness that will
be ours so near!" The last sentence
was uttered to her alone, but the party
heard the rest, and cheered him as be
fore. But though they laughed, they
did not cease rowing. Yet, they did
not increase their lead, for the Roche
boys pulled as lustily as ever.
"Once more I say stop and give her
up or i'1 fire in another minute,"
roared Roche again.
What the issue might have been it is
impossible to say, but in their excite
ment neither party had paid any at

tention-at least the Roches had not
to the fishermen's boat. For, just as
his sons had by extraordinary efforts al
most touched the bridal boat, his boat
dashed plump against their prow and
overturned their craft in a second.
"Now's our chance," cried Dick, and
away they sped.
Meanwhile Roche and his sons, who
all swam like fish, showered angry im
precations upon the awkward fisher
men. The latter apologised profusely.
and helped to right the boat. They
had no idea but what they could pass
between the boats; just did it for a lark,
etc. ltoche threatened dire vengeance
on all of them, but his gun was now
tranquilly reposing on the white sands,
twenty feet below. There was no time
to be lost, since the fugitives were now
nearly across, and Roche and his party
soon left the fishermen far behind.
The bridal party saw them coming,
and their triumph bade fair to be short
lived. However, the parson took the
dilemma by the horns.
"Children," said he, "it's an irregular
thing to do, though perfectly legal;
but I propose to marry you right here
and now. That old fellow will not be
ten minutes behind us when we reach
the shore. and, besides, those boys
have pistols."
"Oh. parson. you surely would not
spoil a wedding like that," said the
younger bridesmaid.
"Mly dear. I can bindl their hearts
and hands just as firmly under this
blue sky as in the most holy church
ever built."
So Nellie was assisted to arise and
was helped in her efforts by the steady
ing arm of Dick. As she stood in the
middle of the boat, under the clear
sky. she made a demure-looking bride.
The roses came back to her cheeks,
and she was herself once more.
As the good parson commenced the
ceremony. one of the bridesmaids man
aged to put the wreath and veil upon
Nellie. Although it was somewhat
rufed. it made quite a pretty appear
ance. The parson afterwards remarked
that it was the shortest marriage cere
mony in his experience. When they
reached the shore a carriage was wait
ing there before the church in which the
ceremony was to have taken place. It
was a work of a few moments to get
into the carriage and drive to the
steamer. which was about to leave.
Just as the steamer pulled out, Mr.
Roche and his sons.. looking a little
the worse for wear from their bath,
struggled up from the beach. They
were just in time to see Nellie waving
her handkerchief from the lower deck.
And the race for the bride had been
won.-St. Louis Republic.

MINER'S SUPERSTITIONS.
On et 'them Was to De With Strkes Dis
esusresi " a Friday.
Superititions of miners are among
the curiosities of mental phenomena
which are pest finding out, as witness
a scrap of conversation in Creede camp
one evening recently:
"llallo, Dave! That strike at the
'Dug Out' is a big thing. Just bin up
there."
"No good, Charley. It hoodoed it
self," was the reply.
"In what style'?"
"It were a Friday job. Pay dirt on
Friday are a devil's gift."
"Onless there's a heap of it. Then
it'll do."
"The more there is, the worse for
the finders," objected Dave. "It cusses
'em all the more. Over on Crip [the
short name for Cripple creek] a fat
streak was struck in the Davis mine
one Friday morning. None of the boys
thought what day it was, they were so
tickled, but after doing a little work to
find out if it was the real cream, they
all got blind drunk and kept tanked
up full for a week. Just a week, and
it was Friday when they got back to
work, you see."
"Had anybody stolen the mine?'"
"Not yet. It were all there, and as
they went further in it got better'n
better. In ten weeks they took off
forty-six wagon loads to the mills, and
it gin 'em back silver worth ninety
flue thousand dollars. The owners
'lowed they could take it to Denver
better'n to send it by express, and they
hired a car over to the Springs and had
the pure stuff loaded in. Then they
stayed there till two in the morning to
guard it. Jest then along came a lot
of 'agents' with mules and carts and
carried off about half the bars, and
left the three fellers tied and gagged,
locked in the car."
"You don't say that 'agents' carried
off a ton 'n a half of silver?"
"Certain and sure. Ycu see, part of
em was galoots from the mill and
knew all about how things was fixed,
and I heern part was from the sheriff's
office to keep order and see there was a
fair divide. Most anybody could be a
agent in them times. '
"VWelll
"Yes, and that hold-up was a Friday
morning. They got to Denver with
the other half of the stuff, got a re
ceipt for it and sold her at a big shave.
I reckon they got pretty nigh $30,000,
but it didn't do 'em no good. They
had worked hard and kep' sobera good
while, and wanted a little blow-out.
They started in by getting too drunk
for any use, and that made 'em too
rich for any sense, so they began to
speckelate in the faro and monte busi
ness, and in two weeks they were
cleaned out. One sobered up afore the
others, and he had about one hundred
dollars left. and they got back to the
'Davis' one Friday night looking like
three old bums."
"But there was good staff left there
yet."
"Oh, plenty. It were good for big
money, but the boys was in debt con
siderable. and so they had to mortgage
her. Some fellow there was always
looking for a chance like that. They
paid their little debts and worked hard
for a week. Then they had a fight
among theirselves, and two knocked
off work and got drunk. T'other stuck
to biz a few days and then he got
drunk. Pretty soon things got so bad
nobody'd trust 'em. and when the
mortgage come due the Ibavi was sold
meas'ly cheap. Some hpc'lators got
her, and they took out pretty nigh on
to six million dollars before she gin
out."
"Well, I don't want no Friday ia
mine."
"Nor I too."--C'incinnati Enquirer.

Everything in a woman's life should
be done temperately, especially the
wearing of corsets. This eternal leo
turing upon the evils of corset-wearing
is all folly; to condemn tight lacing is
another thing., but the loose, wide
made corset is to be commended.
Of eourse all exercise should be taken
with the waist perfectly free, and when
vigorous out-of-door sports are indulged
in no stay should be w-orn; but when in
the street or at home or at sotal func

TOP BUREAU DRAWER.
Gaol t. no as AbselsAs Sewvs ssa ar a

Harriet HoltCahorn says that m
an's bureau drawer--the top drawer.
that either is or is not a eatcb-all--re
veals character more than any of her
possessions, and I could almos tel hi
fortune by looking into it. Is it a pot
pourri-gloves, laces, hairpins, frizmes,
collars, letters and a hundred -r
things? This denotes an uneven, am
systematized, happy-go-lucky life, osa
that fate loves to pursue. The oederly
woman who establishes a standard for
people to live up to always keeps this
bureau drawer in order. Her life is of
the tranquil kind. The worma whe
fills her bureau with boxes pouaaes a
excess of order that makes ife a burdss
to the ones who live with her. UAe s
conservative and not very adSat
nor tolerant. While order is the bias
lane to Heaven, order does not by any
means produce Heaven. However, the
bureau drawer never poses. You may
profess sentiments that are met eer
and your milliner and dresmaoler Ia
you a personality which you do ot par
seas. and pose successfully forwbmt yeo
are not; you can buy correct booksama
pose for a litterateur by livting up to
their bindings. In your hooes and hIt
furnishings you can buy artistie e ~s
and harmony of color and grand pise
tares, and even the atmoomphere th
belongs with these evideuees of emle
will hover alout. You can have a Imais
Quinze room n it hout knowing why you
have it, and you can buy your ouat of
arms and your antiques and you am
ceaturs. and you may eape the a of
all that they represeat and the worus
will be none the iser. Sat let the
world have a peep Ia the top dewsmr ew
your dressing table and it wil te a
things ahout your real et if
which it has never dramed.-PhwMe
phia Times.
