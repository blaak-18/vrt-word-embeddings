"A GREAT REMEDY.
The aeaeslm a1ies Pree Adverstiig
.r a QeGd Thing.
For some weeks past the Caucasian
lh been running an advertisement of
the Swamp A ngel Company. We had
not given it very much attention, and
while we had antisfied ourselves that it
was a good medicine, we had no true
idea of its real value. From direct
evidence we can affirm to any one in
terested that this medicine is possibly
what has long been looked for. We
should be slow to make this assertion
but for the fact that some strong testi
monials have come under our notice.
and we here present them. The orig
inal letters are now in the poseession
of the Caucesian.

Tributes to Human Brave
ry.
The Rev. Robert Wilson of St.
Luke's Epicopal church, says:
"In 183 1 met in Richmond a Col
onel McCoy, of Pennsylvania, who
had been a gallant wearer of the
blue. We got quite chummy over
a 'mixed wood' camp fire, and
wishing to put him at his ease I
I told him the story of Kershaw's
magnificent reconnissance at Fred
ericksburg, which can never be too
often repeated. An orderly had
arrived in hot haste with a com
mand for General Kershaw to have
the enemy reconoitored at all haz
ards from a knoll which was swept
by the fire of the sharp shooters of
both armies. Every bush and tree
had been cut away by the storm of
bullets, and it looked like certain
death to the man who should at
tempt it. Calmly slinging his field
glass, and turning his command
over to the next officer in rank,
Joseph B. Kershaw rode slowly
up to the death trap, into which he
would not send any other man.
The sight of his heroic action as he
sat amid the whistling minies,
sweeping the opposing ranks with
his glass, was too much for the
chivalry of the Yankee command
er, and the order went down the
Federal line: 'Cease firing on that
officer!' The rifles became silent,
the reconnissance was finished, and
raising his cap in acknowledgment,
General Kershaw quietly rode back
at a walk, unharmed."
"It was a splendid incident," re
marked Colonel McCoy, "but I
can cap it with a personal expe
rience of the chivalous disposition
of your men. 1 was on General
Meade's staff near Richmond, and
one morning, with the general at
our head, we rode down to take a
look over the river. As we turn
ed sharply out of the bushes and
came out on the bank, we found
ourselves in point blank range f
a Confederate picket drawn up on
the other sale. A volley wou'd
have emptied every saddle, for we
were entirely at their mercy; but
it would have been murder, f r
they couks not cross and captu:e
us. Recognizing General Mead ,
the commander of the detachment
ordered his men into line, and pres
ented arms. We raised our caps in
grateful acknoweldgment, rode
slowly back into the bushes, and
as soon as we were fairly out of
sight put spurs to our horses and
scudded back to camp as if the
devil was after us."
A Queer Russian Game.
It Involves a Plunge Into Matri
mony or a Heavy Forfeit.
In some parts of Russia a queer
game is still played at Christmas
time which has much to do with
' the future life of the participantP.
Some prominent person in the vil
I lare announces that the annual
merrymaking will be held at his
house. On the appointed day the
young men and women hasten to
his house.
There are songs and games and
dances, but they are simply a pre
lude to the more important busi
ness of the day. When the time
comes, the hosteas leads all the girls
into one room, where they seat
themselves on tbe benches. Laugh
ing sad chattering they are each
promtly mufied in winding sheets
by the hostees. The head and hair
and form are securely covered,
and when she is done the girls re
semble papooses.
The young men draw lots, and
one by one they enter the room
where the muffled girls sit. Help
less so far as sight or touch goes,
the piuuied lover tries to locate
his favorite. Maybe she would
help him if her eyes were not hid
den, but she is as helpless as he.
Finally he chooses one, ad then
he may unveil her. This is the
critical moment, and disappoist
Smeat or rapture will be the aresult
p of seeing her face.
It is the law of custom that the
man shall marry the ,irl be has
Spicked out, and if either backs out
a heavy forfeit must be paid. It
a is said that thisL matrimonial lottery
is productive of many happy mar
riages.-Moscow Correspondence.
