OT INTEREST TO WEALTH PRODUCERS
THE OUTLOOK FOR COTTON.
z
The extravagant reports regarding
the condition of the crops and rosy
prospects for a great yield has given
the speculators something with which
to hammer the very life out of the
cotton market. It looks now as
though the producers will be com
pelled to take from seven and a half
to eight and a half cents for their
cotton, unless the producers shall
organize and resist the onslaught of
tlie thieves and robbers who exploit
the products of the farmer’s toil, for
their ow T n gain. It is the most nefari
ous system that ever militated against
the interest of the honest wealth pro
ducers of any country. I wish that
it were a penitentiary offense to buy
or sell a bale of futures. It would be
a God send if every bucket-shop or
exchange where the hellish business
is conducted could be razed to the
ground. The farmers ’ Co-operative
and Educational Union, are confront
ed with the most serious situation
within its history. If prudence, in
telligence, foresight and a fixed de
termination to protect their own inter
est shall characterize their conduct in
the matter of marketing their crops
they will win, and it will be a great
victory for the commercial interests
of the entire southern country. The
crops should be marketed gradually.
Men who are in debt, if they shall be
able to sell a portion of their crop at
a fair price, my advice would be to
sell a few bales, relieve the pressing
obligations, and then hold the surplus
for what it is worth. Every bank
and monied institution in the south
should go the full length of their
capacity to help the farmers in this
fight against the speculator, cotton
gambler and the unconvicted thieves.
And a victory for the fanners would
not only be a great material advantage
to the people of the cotton growing
section this year, but its effect will be
felt for years to come.—The Issue.
ABOUT DAIRYING.
It beats the world how small farm
ers, men who should be engaged in the
most economical use of their land and
who should be saving every vestige of
fodder and grain and converting it by
the cheapest and quickest means into
the most concentrated and highly
valuable product of the farm, will
hang on to the old notion that the
supreme service of a good cow is to
rear a calf or two for the feed lot
and in the end sacrifice her own body
on the butcher’s block. This beef
idea is an extravagant one. It is far
from economy and we must admit that
in many sections of Kansas, Missouri
and Nebraska we should be interested
deeply in the most economical meth
od of handling our lands. I would not
have it given the impression that
every farm should be converted into
an exclusive dairy farm. I would,
however, have it understood that I
would have on every farm a herd of
eight or ten cows, which cows can be
handled with very great profit to the
farmer and which cows will add very
largely to a system of maintaining soil
fertility, together with a sensible use
of the land in the growing of crops.
The number of cows which a farmer
should milk is dependent entirely
upon his help. The measure of the
dairy herd should be taken from the
standpoint of help alone. Every
farmer in this state can very easily
maintain all the cows his help can
milk.—Farmers’ Advocate.

Gravest Problem of Science Solved
By Discovery of Vast Nitrate
Deposits.
One of the greatest problems which
have in late years occupied the atten
tion of scientists has been solved by
the discovery of new deposits of ni
trate of soda. “How can the ex
hausted fields and fams of the world
be replenished with the nitrogen
which alone can produce food for the
race 1 ?” was the question. The finding
of the now deposits in 'Chile covering
a vast area, is the answer.
Nitrate of soda is not as visibly
connected with the welfare of the
race as sunshine, but it is almost as
important an element in the develop
ment of the individual and the per
petuation of the race.
Some specialists have said that the
Chilean beds, as heretofore known,
would be exhausted in fifty years,
and that the era of decreasing crops
would then begin, with terrible conse
quences to the race. As a matter of
fact, new nitrate of soda deposits
have been discovered continuously
for many years, so that there has ac
tually never been a time when the
American farmer’s supply of nitrate
•was in danger of failing.
The Chilean government, for pur
poses of revenue, took charge of the
vast nitrate deposits soon after their
discovery. It has ever since not only
controlled the known nitrate beds,
but has systematically searched for
others. Deposits of nitrate, of vary
ing size, were constantly being dis
covered, and now comes the discover
ies of nitrate of soda beds which will
last many years. Two immense areas
have only recently been discovered.
• It would seem that nature had placed
the deposits in Chile for the use of
farmers all over the world at just the
time the needs of a growing world
population would require them to re
new their acreage and grow larger
and better crops. A new process
has been invented that will do for the
nitrate business what the cyanide
process did for gold. production.
Heretofore from 9 per cent to 10 per
cent has been left in the waste, but
with the new process it is claimed
that there will not be a loss of 2
per cent, and at a less cost of pro
duction than by the old method.
Even the waste of tailings can be
worked with a great profit.
Nitrate of soda is the world’s
leading fertilizer, and it is gratifying
to note that the American farmer
may now secure unmeasured supplies
of his best fertilizer —contrary to
the general rule—at rates cheaper
“Glje
than ever before. —New York Trib

PAPER FROM COTTON STALKS.
A recently invented system for re
ducing cotton stalks to a suitable
form for the manufacture of paper
is described in Farm and Ranch
(Dallas, Tex., August 15). Accord
ing to this paper most of the diffi
culties which have hitherto prevented
the accomplishment of this task ap
pear now to have been solved. Says
the writer:
‘‘■For many years experts have
been eng-aged in devising some meth
od for producing in a satisfactory
manner paper from cotton stalks.
With the new invention, it is claimed,
farmers in the South will have great
use for the discarded cotton stalks,
which have hitherto been either
thrown away or burned. It has been
demonstrated that by the new pro
cess the heretofore waste product can
be made into pulp and paper of a
good commercial quality.
“It is contended that the fiber
in the stalk and limb of the cotton
plant is considerably stronger than
spruce wood fiber, and that it is al
most as strong as the fiber of the
flax plant, thus making it possible
to produce from cotton stalks a pa
per superior in strength and texture
to that of ordinary wood pulp paper,
and nearly as strong as high grade
linen paper.
•’The stalks would cost little, the
rem oval of the stalks from the plan
tation being of great advantage to
the cotton grower, who must spend
a. good sum every year in the removal
of the stalks from the ground. With
the raw material at hand, and at a
low price, a new industry can be
established which will add many
thousands of dollars to the products
of the cotton plant.
“It is argued that in regions
where the cotton boll weevil has
ruined the crop of marketable cot
ton, the cotton stalk can be utilized
in the making of paper, as it would
help to destroy the pest, while wast
ing none of the reclaimable material.
Heretofore the plants have been
burned to destroy the weevil, but by
this method the whole plant is used,
the leaves and unopened bolls pass
ing through the mill so that there is
no necessity for picking over the
stalks. ’ ’
Comparing the cost of production
of cotton stalk paper over that of
straw paper, the writer finds that
there is a difference of $4.10 in fa
vor of the cotton stalks. It is esti
mated that cotton stalk paper costs
sl4 a ton, straw paper $18.35, while
ground wood as stock for paper man
ufacture costs from $lB to S2O a ton.
and bleached sulfite costs from <SO
to S6O for the domestic and consid
erably more for foreign stock. Ac
cording to these figures the cost of
the finished cotton stalk paper is less
than the price per ton of the cheap
est grade of ground wood pulp.
Moreover:
“The cotton stalk paper can be
made on any regular paper machine,
which demonstrates beyond question
the feasibility of using the stalks in
the manufacture of all grades of pa
per, from the light flmsy qualities to
those of the heavy, coarse wrapping
grades.
“It has been estimated by experts
that the supply of wood fiber for the
making of paper will last but a few
years more, and experiments have
been and are being carried on every
day for a substitute for wood pulp.
“With the cotton stalks at hand,
the paper manufacturer should in
vestigate this matter thoroughly so
that when his supply of wood fibre
becomes exhausted he can turn to a
substitute which is at hand.
“From a compilation of statistics
regarding the best fibers for paper
making, it has developed that cotton
stalks make the finest paper for book
work, and that paper so made is
more lasting and durable than paper
made from any other material.” —

MAKE SUGAR FROM WOOD. .
Chewing Toothpick Suggested Pos
sibility of Manufacture to
California Man.
4 4 Sugar manufactured from wood is
not now only possible, but is being
made and put on the market,” says
Dr. D. F. McGraw, head of the
Wayne-McGraw Sugar manufacturers
of San Jose. 44 A few months ago,
when we stated such a process of
manufacture could become practicable
many scoffed. That sugar could be
taken from forest trees, barks and
other solid materials seemed im
probable. Today our company has
an office in San Francisco, a plant at
San Jose, and in time we shall extend
our interest to Southern California.
“We ship large quantities of this
sugar to candy makers, wholesale
dealers and others who handle the
sweet stuff. Thre is no adulteration
or impurity about it. According to
analyses, it is 99.87 per cent pure. It
is the sweetest sugar you ever tasted. -
It answers every purpose that sugar
is used for. It is w’hite, grandulated
fine and has the best sugar ‘bested* in
many respects.”
Dr. McGraw said the saccharine is
drawn by electricity from wood and
other solid materials. Electricity also
is used in disseminating the vapor,
and a chilling process condenses and
granulates the substances. He said
the idea of making sugar from these
materials originated with the man who
chewed toothpicks and soft woodsplin
ters. There was a sweet taste noticea
ble and the proper application of
electricity brought out this quality.
44 1 n appearance and taste,” said
Dr. McGraw, 4 4 the manufactured
sugar is not unlike that made from
sugar cane or the beet. In time the
manufacturing process may be so
perfected that ‘wood sugar’ will be
the leading kind on the market. The
materials, pulps, barks and woody
matters would not be available in
immense quantities'—New England
