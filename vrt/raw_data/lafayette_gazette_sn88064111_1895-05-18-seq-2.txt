Killing men over false and faith- i
less wives seems to be growing epi- t

it has almost become a fad in some l
sections. If the matter should ever c
be reversed and the women of the r
country go gunning for faithless hus- I
bands, then there will be a great v
wailing and gnashing over this tt
beautiful land of the free.-Patter- -s
son Optic.
When a man is "spoiling for as
fight" and tries to pose as a bad
man, his hunger should be appeased c
and the strings taken off him that
he might have full liberty to go t
for to and get "done up." Never c
hold one of these man-eaters when 1
they are in trim for a fray, it only r
makes them rave the more while all c
the time he is inwardly praying for c
some one to hold the other fellow. t

A good, honest farmer was stand
ing in front of the Court House,
yesterday looking mournfully at his i
tax receipt. "He said: "I brought I
a bale of cotton here five years ago,
sold it for $49.50-WVith this money
I paid taxes, $22; got a dress for
my wife, $5; shoes for my children,
$5; a barrel of flour, $5.50; fifty a
pounds of sugar, $5; ten pounds of b
coffee, $2, and went home happy h
with $3 75 in my pocket for the
preacher. I brought in a bale to
day, sold it for $22.50; paid my
taxes $2z2.25, and have a quarterd
left. They tell me I can get flour. tl
frocks and sugar, shoes for half I
paidthen, but it 'pears to me I haint
got the half. I've about made up
mymind to invest this quarter in
United States bonds and howl for
the gold standard."-Birmingham,i t
Ala , Daily States.
It will not do for the free silver b
papers to call their opponents all i
sorts of ugly names and for the gold V
standard papers to abuse the silver 0
'people and call them "brainle.s
idiots, crazy populists, etc." This b
kind of warfare will do good to no
cause. This money question
should be discussed in a calm, dis- it
passionate, honest way. It should a
be a campaign of education and '
not of blackguardism. The hum- I
blest citizen in the land is as much
interested in its solution as the P
richest man on Wall street. TheP
eranks are not all on one side and P
all the brains on the other. Whenr
men like Palmer, Carlisle, Morkan, 6
Crisp and Voorhies disagree there ci
-must be two sides to the question,
and it is only natural that thosec
mot so well informed are also di- it
vided.

Hon. C. J. Boatner, the well
known congressman from North
Louisiana, is a very able politician
and his interview in Tuesday's
Times-Democrat should set the
Democrats of Louisiana to thinking.
$ The distinguished gentleman is re
ported as having given utterance to
the following words:
He felt that in the present con
dition of the Democtatic party that
the Democrats who had the interest
of their State at heart could not af
ford to play fast and loose with the
questions which would engross their
attention later. He was of the
opinion that it was absolutely ne
cessary for the Democrats to sink
whatever personal differences they
might have and combine for the de
fense of the party. It made no
difference to him who represented
t the head of the ticket provided that
the nominee was a true man and a
Democrat. He believed that the
two elements of the Democratic
party should be given full and equal
representation on the ticket. Tne
McEnery men had stood true to the
party and had rallied to its support,
sacrificing their personal desires in
so doing, and in the midst of the
changes which had been rung in the
r political compleatior of the State
in the past two years they had re
mained true to their colors.
All Democrats who desire the
success of the party at the next
election will agree with Mr. Boat
ner that there should be harmony in
stead of factional wrangling. Against
a divided Democracy the Populists
of North Louisiana and the Repub
licans of the Southern portion of
the State will have a good chance
of carrying the election. There is
no issue upon which all Democrats
will not agree and personal differ
ences should not be permitted to
stand in the way of a harmonious
Democracy. The question of office
simply must be settled inside the
party with fairness to all aspirants.
Congressman Boatner's interview
are the words of a good Democrat
and will serve as a warning to those
members of the party who are will
ing to split the Democratic organ
ization in twain for the considera
ticn of a paltry office. The only
way to defeat the Republicans and
Populists, should they enter into a
dicker, is by united action on the
part of the Democ.atic leaders.
Let's go into this fight together and
victory is ours. If we fight be
tween ourselves, the enemy will
step in and take it away from us.

TI-E COTTOiV ACREAGE.
Courier Journal.
The report of the Statistician of
the Agricultural Department on the I
cotton area planted so far is calcu
lated to depress the market. As it
made out a decrease of but 3-I per
cent. from last year it really indi
cates a larger crop. Last spring I
the season was forward and almost
the entire crop had been planted by
May i, though a cold spell later on
made some replanting necessary. i
This spring has been backward, and
if the acreage is only three points
less than 1894, it should mean not
only that there will be no decrease,
but also a positive gain in acreage.
It must be said that the statistics
of the Agricultural Depirtment are
at variance with the reports received
by cotton men from the South. It
has been agreed that the reduction
in acreage would not be very large,
but it is believd that it will reach
15 to 2o per cent. The Texas
drouth and the backward spring
this supposition extremely reasona- f
ble.
It is quite probable that the Liv
erpool market will be unfavorably
effected by the report. There is,
however, top little cotton left in
this countrf'fo4 prices to be serious- E
ly disturbed. , Consumption has
been so much increased, both at
home and abroard, that the total
visidle supply is but little in excess s
of that at the same time last year. 1
The crop wi an extraordinary one,
but the exp.it movement was so un
pr.cedented that the surplus has
been practically disposed of. Also 1
it should not be forgotten that the r
aggregate yield of the last three
years was actually les than the total
of the three preceding crops. t
(Cotton is yet below the cost of I
production, of 6/ cents in Mem- j
phis means only 5N/ cents on the
plantation. And it can not be
raised outside of Texas for less than ,
6 cents. Not even under such ex-r
ceptional circumstances as now pre
vail can it long remain below th s
cost. Another big crop would keep
it down but this, after all, will de
pend more upon the season than the S
acreage planted.

To the Lafayette Gazette:
Some time has elapsed since I
wrote you, but I have been very
busy and I am busy yet. I see no
rest ahead.
The health of our little city is
very good. A little measles now
and then. Our parish representa
tive, Hon. J. Y. Sanders, has had
a tussle with measles, and he came
out victorious, afte, a long siege.
WVas shocked to hear of the death
of Mrs. Eliza Greig. She was our
near neighbor for twoyears there,
and her calls were always pleasant
and apprec-ated.
Any improvements going on in
Lafayette? Any new comers? Any
new papers? How are the old ones
doing? J-Iow is The Gazette?
Franklin is said to be on a boom,
and I suppose the present state of
prosperity is unprecedented, and it
is unaccountable. Last year, when
it became known that the bounty
on sugar was lost, our leading men
predicted that property in the town
and parish would depreciate fifty
per cent in value, and that business
would be paralyzed for some time
to come. We are glad to say that
exactly the opposite has been the
result. Building sites are ih active
demand, houses ate rapidly going
up, and thy are occupied as soon
as built. Business houses are not
being ereted as rapidly as dwellings,
yet Mr. M. Bell has begun on Main
street, a store house, which is to
cost $z8.ooo.
Crop prospects are good, and
wedding bells are ringing as though
the town were on fire. This scribe
alone has married three couples in
less than two weeks.
With love for all in Lafayette,
and success to The Gazette, we Tut
down a period. H. ARMSTRONG.
Obituary.
Mrs. Lucinda Spell Hoffpauir,
wife of Mr. Nathan Hoffpauir, died
at the family residence eight miles
south, west of Duson near Indian
bayou, on the 6th of May, after a long
illness. The deceased was born in
Vermilion parish on the zoth of
October, 1815. She had been mar
ried sixty-two years and would have
been So years old in October. She
had run her race, fought the good
fight, and laid up her treasures in
heaven. Alrs. Hoffpauir was one
of the kindest and most gentle of
women and was universally beloved.
She was a member of the Methodist
church and one of the most faithful
and constant of Christians. Through
all her sufferings she was patient
and gentle. She leaves thirteen
children. five daughters and eight
sons. Her living, posterity num
bers two hundred and four. Her
remains were followed to the grave
by a vast assemblage of relatives,
friends and acquaintances, all in
solemn silence stifling their grief at
the loss of a good woman. On
looking over the long line of proces
sion we thought truly that the I'me
mory of the righteous shall live".
The s ,rrowing husband and child
ren who feel that their loss is indeed
irreparable, should not sorrow how
ever as those having no hope. They
have the consolation of knowing;
that "the Lord hath given the
Lord hath taken :way", and that
"his name is blessed". In her life
and in her death, her family and
friends have an example of a shining
memory of virtue, unaffected good
ness and of religion pure and unde
filed which should make an impres
sion never to be erased.

A Hospital Without Liquor.
The London Temperance Hospi
tal recently celebrated its twentieth
anniversary. At first many looked
upon the idea of a hospital without
alcohol as a veritable craze of a few
fanatics,. but now the medical jour
I nals admit the success and also the
importance of the experiment. And
this experiment ought to be much
better known.to medical men than it
is, for it gives a serious blow to a still
fashionable doctrine regarding the
necessity of alcohol in the treat
ment of disease. This hospital has
eighty-six beds, and last year 1,o36
patients were accommodated. In
the out-patient department 5, x04
r new cases were dealt with, while the
new accident and emergency cases
amounted to 4,969.
*"A respect for the highest princi
ples of temperance in regard to
t liquors is more deep-rooted in the
editorial offices cf the leading Amer
ican magazines than many people
know or might believe." Such were
the encouraging words that met my
eyes not long ago while reading an
exchange. The article proceeds to
s give the experience of a noted au
e thor, who however, remains name
less, in submitting a manuscript to
some of the best magazines. This
author did not, it seems,* *"in any
sense advocate drinking" but had
given in narrative form a history of
wines and the custom of drinking.
t The manuscript was only successful
in its repeated returns to the author
and now reposes in his desk
"Icrowned with the distinction as
being the only one he has ever had
declined." There are many hope
ful signs of victory for the final
triumph of the total abstinence sen
timent. The general literature of
the day is much purer than it was a
few years ago, wine and cigars sel
dom accompanying the social scenes
depicted. It has been said that
Satan makes the most elaborate
flourishes of his weapons when he
is nearest defeat. It that is true,
taking into common consideration
the victories we can see and the
ostentatious thrusts of the liquor
flag in our faces, hope may well
grow more assured every day.

the Conumonwealer in Fiction.
Miss Adeline Knapp, well known as one
of the cleverest women writers on the Paci
fic coast, has put the commonwealer of
Coxey's army into fiction, as in a story
called "'The \Vealer," which appears in the
May Arenta. It is a very suggestive com
tlentary, not upon the fantastic Coxey
novenment, but upon existing industrial and
social conditions.
As an analysis of the origin of much of
the shocking crime that daily fill the news
papers, it suggests that there are Cains in
(,.or midst who never shed blood, but simply
kill hope and opportunity.
Everybody who reads ?.iss Knapp's story
carefully will he impressed with its fidelity
to the aspects of every-day life, and its great
power of suggesting all the complex forces
o,f society in a simple sketch of individuet
experience. In Miss Knapp we have a new
writer of fiction who will assuredly win a
high place for herself.
