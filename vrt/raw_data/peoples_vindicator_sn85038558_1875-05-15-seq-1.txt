COMMITTEE. ,
K, coNTINUED.]
Q. If the soldiers had not been up
there what would have been the col
ored vote ?
A., would not like to say; I dent
really think the colored vote would
have been five hundred. I know I
would not have gone to the polls.
Q. Does the Democratic paper up'
there urge the non-employment of
colored people who voted the Re
publican ticket ?
A. Yes, sir; It says the preference
should be given to those who voted
the white man's ticket.
Q- Q. Do you know of any colored
men that voted the Democratic ticket
for that reason I

; A. Well, sir, I cannot say.
S Q. Were they men who were resr
l pected and esteemed:by the colored
men t
A. Yes, sir.
Q. By the Chairman-What is the
provision for edacation of the people
of your parish
A. We have had public schools up
to the. time of the thorough organisa
tion of the White League in the par.
ish. Since that, we have had. none.
There was one in town, a colored
- school. That was taught contrary to
law. It is established as a public n
school in which all children from six d
to twenty-one years of age, have; a it
right to enter.

as rDemocratici
Q. Were there many who voted the
Democratic ticket through fear, do
he you think t
A. Well, I saw some that came in
town on the day of election from Mr.
-- I cnnet call his name. The
gentleman lives on Red River. Harris,
I thib, from his place. They were
led by one white man and another
*AL behind them. It is said that they
voted the Democratic ticket. I know
that when a colored man voted the
Democratic.ticket there was an extra
door in the backt par of the Court
House where he was brought in and
given acesm to the ballot bor.
Q. Do you have any such thing as
d Black Leagues in your parish t I
A. There never was sach a thing
in that parish.
S Q. Did you know .of any attacki
of made on colored men voting the Deom
- ocratic ticket t
A. I" nevdr knew of any. I have
ce heard white men say that negroes had
tad been punished for voting the Demo
cratei ticket.
Q. Did any colored men ever make
et complaints of that to you !
A. Never.
Q. Do you think that it is a dis
to like of carpet-baggers that creates
it the trouble between the white Demo- I
I rats and the colored Republicans I
ye A. I think their hatred is for both
the negroes and carpet-baggers. If a
Ii- Democrat, from the North, a fair
minded man, had gone through tihe
at country and canvassed it during the
- last campaign, or revolution, or what.
ever you call it, and made a speech
fairly and squarely, and disapproved
es of the way they had gone on and in
timidated the voters; I don't think t
tat that hwould have been safo for
Shim.
Q.. Even or a Democrat! I
A. For a Democrat; I don't believe
it would have been safe for him. I
say this because there were white
men in that parish, rich men, who h
of were fair men, and some of whom had a
dg really joined the Republican party,
and who were always highly respect- b
ed, and as soon as they went in the
r- Republican party, the were ostracised I
by the whites. The feeling was so
T strong against them that I have in p
my hands resignations from them,
'7 leaving the Republican party and t:
saying that they would not take any o
7 part in the campaign ; but some say G
in their resignation a "lam neverthe- ma
Iles a Republiean. We had Mr. C. 0
Chaplin, Sr.. who was our candidate
•* for DistriotJudge; in case the Gov- pi
ernor should order an election for
if Judge of the 17th Judicial District, e:
we should have run him. He was a
Sr fairmn., who always was well res- ti
Id pected by both, Republicans and Ii
and Democrats. ' He wae willing to
accept the nemlaation; but the pres
I sure went so strone against the whites P
10 joiipg the Republican party, so he
had Mfeuse.
Q. ' t. spoke of colrired men being th
swiadled onit of their wages I g
A. As a general thin, they go to as
s" work on some plantation and they
d go in for part of the crop, and when be
0 the crop is made some of them are wl

PATCHWORK QCILTs.-Either of
k, the following designs make effective
u quilts : Small pieces of colored silks
and satin, with which black is also
o used, the black nlproving the colors
of very much. First is a sexageonl
In shape, made thus: Six colored pieces
,- are tacked around one colored piece,
Id then surrounded with black, so that
tl- when the quilt is finished, at looks as
is if there was a ring of the black
around each colored center. The
. other is in diamonds-four black
ul pieces between each four colored ones.
A shape cut out in tin to eat all the
papers by for silk or satin patch
r- work, will be found a convenience.
We omait giving the size for cutting
the pieces, that depending entirely
t, upon the size of the pieces of the
material on hand.
Care of Horses.-Provide blankets
I. for the horses. A warm blanket will
save feed and loss of time by sick
ness. Avoid exposure to cold raius,
and, if caught in a storm, lot the
V, horses be rubbed dry before the bIan
kLets are put over them. Keep the
II stalls clean, and on no account-allow
- manure to gather beneath the horses'
" feet. This injures the hoofs, and of.
ten produces cracked heels. Besides,
e it renders the air foul, and is very in
jurious to the animals' eyes. In the
efiort to keep the stable warm, proper
ventilation should not be neglected.
e The curry-comb and brush should not
lie idle; their use invigorates thei
skin, and promotes healthful secrs.
Li tons.
Manure for Potatoes.--Potash Is
e the great specific manure for pota
toes. Nitrogen is not so valuable;
therefore the sulphate of potash
should not be chosen in preference to
the nitrate of soda. Superphosphate
is also an excellent fertilizer for this
crop. There is no difference between
e home-made superphosphate and the
factory-made, if the latter is pare.
i The process of manufacture is very
dangerous and inconvenient -fr a
a person not skilled in the manipula
tion of sulphuric acid, and i) is not
I to be recommended as a generatthing.
t The largest variety of potatoes is
frequently the poorest. Early Bose
i 4,as choice variety, and when well
grown is of good size and yields well,
and is the very best- table potato. If
potatoes are grown for the stairc
they contain, varieties of poor eating
quality, but large yielders, may be
the most profitable. The Peerless is
a large yielder, but a poor flavored
variety.-[N. Y. Times.
