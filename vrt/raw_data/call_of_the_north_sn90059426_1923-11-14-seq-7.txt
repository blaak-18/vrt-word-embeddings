PRESS SUPPRESSES STORY
OF INSULT TO THE FUR
Fraternal Weekly Fights to Have Mob Punished
For Trampling on Emblem of Purity
and 100 Per Cent Americanism.
Washington, D. C.—The American
Flag was snatched from an automo
bile on the streets of Dayton, Ohio,
September 9, and trampled under the
filthy feet of a mob of foreigners,
mostly Italians with a sprinkling of
Jews. Some of the leaders were
arrested and taken to the Dayton po
lice station but were released. The
matter was officially brought to the
attention of the United States At-
torney for the Southern District of
Ohio, but ae replied that there was no
law by which die guilty could be
punished.
The Romanised press of the coun
try did not carry a line on the dese
cration of the flag. The Dayton pa
pers, where the insult occurred, re
fused to use the story, because of
pressure brought to bear from Catho
lic priests, who threatened a business
boycott, if they used the story.
In despair, a patriotic American,
the man who brought the case to the
attention of the United States At
torney's office at Cincinnati, appealed
to The Fellowship Forum, a fraternal
weekly, published at the National
Capital. The Forum sent a repres
entative to William J. Burns, chief df
the Bureau of Investigation, Depart
ment of Justice. Mr. Burns was
shown a copy of the letter to The
Fellowship Forum and a copy of the
letter from Assistant United States
Attorney Haveth E. Mau, who stated
that the culprits could not be pun
ished.
Mr. Burns stated that they could be
punished. He asked The Fellowship
Forum to secure important data and
promised to persecute the Culprits,
“whether they be Catholics, Jews or
whatever they are.*
sirs PUBLIC SCHOOL
IS CHEAT EQUALIZER
Baltimore, Md.—“ The public school
of America is the great equalizer,”
declared John H. Cowles, grand com
mander, before the supreme council
of thirty-third degree Scottish Rite
Masons, which met at Washington, D.
C., last week.
“It is the remover of all class feel
ing, the leveler of race and creed
distinction, where the child of the
rich mingles with the child of the
poor, where the child of the Catholic
should mix freely and without self
consciousness with the child of the
Jew. Mohammedan and Christian,
Buddhist and heathen, Latin and Celt,
Americans and foreigners can meet
there and have their minds moulded
for the future. Then they can grasp
the full meaning of liberty and fra
ternity and thus become fully armed
with manly vigor and intelligent rea
son.”

—K-K-K
Wilmington, Del.—Patriotic Ameri

the church of Rome.
Recently trustees of the Point
Breeze rural school district tossed
histories used as text books out of
the window and burned them. Asked
to explain their action by a commit
tee of Roman Catholics, the trustees
said that the books were un-Ameri
can and they would not consent to
their children studying any more anti-
American fext books.
Dr. H. V. Holloway, state superin
tendent of instruction, hurried to this
place and after investigating the
cause for the ill-feeling between the
parents of the students and the Ro
man Catholic residents of the district,
declared that new histories would be
sent the school and the students
would not be forced to study unpatri
otic text books.

Although the United States Gov
ernment maintains the Department of
Justice, with tax payers' money, for
conducting investigations of tills na
ture, Mr. Burns asked the fraternal
weekly to secure the information, In

operatives on the job. However,
The Fellowship Forum is glad to be
of assistance to the Government and
kelp prosecute these foreign hood
lums.
It is also glad to enter the fight to
learn, why the Romanised press re
fused to use the story, despite the
fact that Catholics claim they owe no
temporal allegiance to the Fspe and
that they are “patriotic diaens of
the United States.*
If their desecration of the flag is a
sample of their flaunted patriotism,
the patriotic press of the country
should take precautions that no such
patriots are given further offices in
the National, State or local govern
ments.
The insult to the flag by Roman
Catholics at Dayton, Ohio, recalls a
similar incident that occurred sever
al months ago at Houston, Texas,
when Father Kirwin, a recognized
power of the Catholic church in
Texas, refused to salute the American
Flag and in a public sermon took
occasion to further insult Americans.
That was not half of the story, for
Kirwin launched on this bitter de
nunciation of Americans in a Catho
lic church that was holding a public
ceremony over the death of a Catho
lic, whose body had been returned
from France. There was no funeral
oration, simply an out-burst of Papel
denunciations against 100 per cent

—K-K-K
The State of New York is in the
hands of the Romans from soup to

of the Senate to Seagaant-at-arms;
its state government from Governor
to Constable. The City of New York
from Mayor to street cleaners—ex
cept in each instance, where they are
Jews. God pity the loyal, nativf
born Protestant Christian 100 per
cent Americans!
It is in New York state where the
building owned by the W. C. T. U. has
been arbitrarily stricken from the
“exempt rolls* and assessed for taxes
because —The W. C. T. U. is held a
“superfluous organization.*
It was the legislature of New York
state which defied the constitution of
the United States and repealed the
Mullan-Gage Act, a state law -enact
ed to facilitate the enforcement of
prohibition under the National Vol
stead Act—a part of our National
Constitution.
It was Governor A. E. Smith of
New York who has just said at the
convention of governors in the White
House that “The Volstead low was not
enforceable.”
It is in New York state where the
state government and enforcement of
ficers flout the United States con

by the constitution of the Roman

It was in New York City where the
Irish Roman Catholic women formed
a parade and displayed insulting ban

It was in New York City with its

along with the state, where native
born, Protestant Christian citizens
have been deprived of the "RIGHTS”
GUARANTEED them by our NA

The Romanists boastfully repro
duced the remark of a deluded Pro

PROTESTANT LANDSLIDE
SWEEPS IN ELECTION
-K-K
Ohio Joins Ranks of Klan Stronghold When
Majority of Cities Elect Patriots for Mayors
Protestants went to the polls in IS
states of the Union November 6 and
acquitted themselves with valor, re*
leasing the yoke of Roman influence
in all six of the Northern states that
held elections and scored decisively
in all of the Southern states.
A 1 Smith’s administration as gov
ernor of New York was repudiated at
the polls when the Protestants sup
ported the Republican ticket and
made decisive gains up state as well
as down state. The Protestant vote
returned a Republican majority in
the assembly, which cast off Papal in
fluence.
Repudiation of Gov. Smith’s admin
istration also earned a popular de
nunciation of Tammany Hall methods
and bosses. Tammany Hall and A 1
Smith had made a- determined fight
to wrest the control of the state as
sembly from the Republicans, but
the Republicans, supported by a de
cided Protestant vote, elected 85 Re
publicans, as against 65 Democrats.
The Tammany Hall gang managed
to sweep the judicial elections in
New York city,' but to their over
whelming Catholic, foreign, and Jew
ish majority.
Thirty per cent of New York city
voters are Protestant, while the other
70 per cent is anti-Protestant and
anti-American. Therefore it was an
easy matter for Tammany Hall to
win out in the judicial elections.
Shriner la Elected
Election of W. F. Kendrick—a
prominent Shriner who had the sup
port of the Protestant vote and the
bitter opposition of Catholics —as
mayor of Philadelphia by a 200,000
majority proves beyond a doubt that
Pennsylvania has joined the Protest
ant cause. Mr. Kendrick is a Repub
lican and his entire ticket was swept
into office in the Protestant land
slide.
Vermont repudiated Rome’s ambi
tions to repeal the Volstead act when
it elected Porter H. Dale, United
States senator, over Park H. Pollard,
who ran on a “modified wet” plat
form.
Ohio, where the principal issue in
volved was the Ku Klux Klan, elected
mayors in all of the principal cities
who had the indorsement of the Klan.
Only one candidate running in oppo
sition to the Klan was elected. It
was a landslide over the state for
Protestants and Klansmen.
Indiana also joined the ranks of
the states that were swept by the
Protestant-Klan landslide. The Klan
was the principal issue in this state,
and a majority of the candidates
supported by the Klan were elected
to office.
Between Two Fires
The Catholics were between two
fires in Maryland and the Klan was
bound to win, regardless of the out
come of the gubernatorial election.
Gov. Ritchie was re-elected governor
over the Republican candidate, Arm
strong. Ritchie is the first governor
in the history of Maryland that has
been re-elected to office. His vio
tory was due to the fight he has made
in bringing the public school system
of the state out of ft* disgraceful po
sition, which it held under previous
administrations. His fight for the
betterment of the public schools won
him the support of Protestants in
general and the Ku Klux Klan in
particular.
Gov. Ritchie had the support of the
state Klan leaders, while National
Klan Organizer Hawkins threw his
support to Mr. Armstrong. Almost
the state-wide ticket, indorsed by pa
triotic Protestants, was engulfed in
the landslide and elected to serve
Protestantism.
Sweep Kentucky
Kentucky returned to the fold of
the solid South and elected a Demo
cratic governor, who had the support
of the Protestant organizations.
Protestant candidates all over the
state were elected in a majority of
the cases.
Mississippi also elected a Demo
cratic governor.
The trend in Michigan was indi
cated when the fiery cross was set
up and ignited at the entrance of the
city hall in Detroit, before the polls
for the municipal election opened.
Mayor Frank E. Doremus was re
elected.
The Protestant organizations made
their greatest gains in Ohio, where
the issue resolved itself into one of
"Klan or no Klan.” The Klan fac
tion won in a walkaway. Protestant
supported candidates were elected
mayors in practically every town and
city in the state. ,
Gableman Defeated
Protestants showed their utter con
tempt for Mayor William N. Gable
man of Portsmouth, who recently or
dered the arrest of 244 Klansmen for
marching in a parade. Ralph Cal
vert, the Klan candidate, won by an
overwhelming majority.
Charles F. Scheible, Klan candidate
for mayor of Youngstown, was swept
THE CALL OF THE NOBTH
into office by a majority over the
combined vote of his five opponents.
A. Stevens, a Klan candidate, was
elected mayor of Newark, Ohio, over
E. D. Leach, who was supported by
the Catholic element.
The old aldermanic form of govern
ment in Cleveland, yrhich had the op
position of Protestant forces, was
ousted by a big majority and 25 can
didates were elected to serve as coun
cilmen. From now on the city will
be controlled by a city# manager and
his councilmen.
Michigan City, Ind., swept the en
tire ticket of five commissioners in
dorsed by the Klan into office.
Sith Repudiated
Discussing the Republican victory
in New York state in electing a Re
publican majority in- the assembly,
George K. Morris, state chairman,
was emphatic in his declaration that
the voters had repudiated Smith’s
Catholic administration. The new as
sembly will have 85 Republicans and
65 Democrats. His statement fol
lows:
“This means a repudiation of the
efforts of Tammany to gain control
of the state, and particularly of the
administration of Gov. Smith, who
made a personal appeal for the elec
tion of a Democratic majority. Ap
parently the people will have no
more of the governor’s so-called
‘program.’ ”
The Tammany Hall crowd lost up
state, despite the tremendous fight at
a great expense that was carried on
in t hat section of New York to break
up the solid Republican representa
tion in the assembly. •
Speaker Machold, upon whom Gov.
Smith trained his big guns and ap
pealed to the priesthood and “faith
ful” Catholics of Jefferson county to
defeat, won handily over the t anti-
Klan candidate. He will be the next
speaker of the assembly, as well as a
conspicuous figure in next year’s
gubernatorial race.
Klan Landslide
In Suffolk county the Klan elected
all of its candidates but one. Arthur
«
H. Myers, running on an independ
ent ticket for the assembly, with the
support of the Protestant voters ran
Harry W. Fowler a close race. A re
count of the vot|s may return Myers
the victor, but in defeat the Elian
made a great showing in a Catholic
stronghold by winning all but one
office and running the anti-Klan can
didate a close race in it.
The constitutional amendment, sup
ported by the New York Klans, to
legalize a $45,000,000 state bonus for
war veterans, carried by a big ma
jority.
Wednesday night 400 Klansmen
staged a spectacular hooded parade
on the streets of Alexandria, Va.,
George Washington’s home, in cele
bration of the Klan victory in defeat
ing Sheriff A. C. Clements, who ran
on a ticket in bitter opposition to
the Klan. At midnight another cele
bration was held at Oakland, Arling
ton county, as a token of the Klan’s
victory.

ROMAN PRIEST INSULTS
MEMORY OF LATE
PRESIDENT HARDING
Indiana, Pa.—Rev. N. P. McNellis,
Roman Catholic priest of this city,
insulted the memory of the late
President Harding when he refused to
participate in the memorial services
here November 2 for the dead Presi
dent, although he was afforded a place
on the program.
In "an open letter,” published in
the press of this city, Rev. McNellis
explains his refusal to attend the
ceremonies in the following words:
"No funeral services, solemn or
simple, are given to members of the
church who are not in good standing
at the hour of death, no matter what
be their standing in society. And if
the church refuses services to Cath
olics who have fallen away from the
faith even temporarily, a fortiori she
refuses to all non-Catholics.”
Rev. McNellis evidently believes in
the Papal doctrines that the gates of
heaven are barred to all but Cath
olics, and our great and beloved chief
is now in hades with millions of other
Masons and non-Catholics, who have
passed on lacking the prayers of the
priesthood.
Masons and Klansmen! Was this
priest’s insult of his own free will
and accord or was he merely a tool
of some cardinal or other high mon
key-monk of the riesthood in Ameri
ca? We leave it to you.

CONGREGATIONLISTS
AND PRES. CDOUDDE
As is well known Calvin Coolidge
is the first President of the United
States of Congregational faith and
lineage. It has been a matter of
speculation aa to whether he were
actually a member of the church and
a professed Christian, or only a
brother-in-law, as it was known Mrs.
Coolidge was a member in active
standing. Many thought when they
read that on Sunday, August 5, fol
lowing the tragic death of President
Harding, when the weight of his new
responsibilities and sincere grief for
his fallen chieftain were pressing
hard upon his soul, Mr. Coolidge re
ceived the communiop at the hands
of his pastor, surely the new Presi
dent is a professed Christian. But
always there was a question mark be
cause no one would state positively
just where Mr. Coolidge stood and he
himself is the nation's man of silence.
But the meeting of the National
Council was the occasion if not the
cause for the removal of all doubt-as
to the President’s stand.
Coolidge Joins the Church
First came the election of Presi
dent Coolidge as honorary moderator
of the National Council, and Mr. Cool
idge’s modest acceptance of the hon
or. This was on Wednesday, Octo
ber 17. The next evening a telegram
came to the pastor of the First Con
gragational Church of Washington,
the Rev. Jason Noble Pierce, who
was in Springfield as a delegate to
the National Council of Congrega
tional churches, announcing that ear
lier in the evening, Thursday, Octo
ber 18, President Coolidge had been
officially accepted as a member of the
church and the time of his joining
had been dated back to August 5,
when fotf the first time he had re
ceived the holy communion in the
church.
It may have seemed to some a very
simple matter and to certain skep
tical and suspicious critics it may
have seemed a bid for the church po
litical vote, but we are certain that
to the Rev. Mr. Pierce, the pastor,
and to those who know the inner life
of President Coolidge the act was
fraught with the deepest religious
significance and was the result of a
conviction which had its roots in an
overwhelming sense of the need of
God. Neither Washington at Valley
Forge nor Abraham Lincoln before
the Battle of Antietam felt a pro
founder desire for divine guidance
than did Calvin Coolidge wh6n he
faced the problems of this agonized
world as the head of the world’s
greatest republic whose material and
spiritual resources have placed it in
providential leadership.
The Rev. Mr. Pierce gave a per
sonal statement to the press in which
he said that President Coolidge
wanted to join the church at the
time he took the communion but he
feared his motives would be misun
derstood. His election as honorary
f moderator of the National Council of
Congregational Churches seemed to
open the way. The choice of Wash
ington, D. C., as the place for holding
the next National Council in 1925
was undoubtedly influenced by inter
est in President Coolidge and even if
he should not be in the White House
as President, he will undoubtedly
preside at one session as the honor
ary moderator.
The Edwards church in Northamp
ton where the Coolidge family at
tends when at home, as already re
ferred to, derives its name from the
immortal Jonathan Edwards, who
was the most famous of Northamp
ton’s pastors. When the church sexton
showed our party the Coolidge fam
ily pew he was asked whether Mr.
Coolidge was a Christian and wheth
er he partook of the communion.
This was on the very day President
Coolidge joined the church but be
fore the fact had become known.
“I don’t know whether Mr. Cool
idge is a Christian or not and I don’t
think he ever took communion,” said
the sexton, “but one thing is certain
he never failed to put his offering in
the collection basket.”
The Congregationalists in the Na
tional Council showed a fine ppre
ciation of the President’s act by
treating it as a sacred, personal mat
ter and not one to be exploited for
denominational gain. While the fact
was given to the press, and it would
have been a crime against the coun
try not to have done so, there was
no demonstration at the public meet
ing and no public congratulations
either in speeches or resolutions.—

EX-STAGE HAND HAS REACHED “THfc
END OF THE TRAIL.”
Oklahoma City, Okla.—The contin
uances, delays, demurrers, protests,
counter charges, explanations, “of
ficial statements” and other impedi
menta which alias Jack Walton is
using to prevent the will of the peo
ple of the Sovereign State of Okla
homa going into effect mean nothing,
according to impartial observers here.
It is recognized that the ex-stage
hand has reached “The End of the
Trail.” By his own un-American ac
tivities he has doomed himself to po
litical oblivion by the actions which
brought about his impeachment aa
governor.
His future will be determined by
whatever holds out the most money
for “Jack” say those who know him.
He has considered a barnstorming
tour during which he would "orate”
against the Klan. The poor success
of such patrioteere as “Paddy" O’Don
nell of Unity League infamy, and
Governor Parker of Louisania are a
deterrent to this course, however.
Maybe he will resume the eale of
patent medicine or go into vaudeville,
for which he undoubtedly feels fitted
by his one-time experience as a stage
hand in New York, or, perhaps he will
continue to operate the morning news
paper he established here as his
mouthpiece with funds of which the
source is largely a mystery.
In this connection it has become
known that thousands of dollars in
public funds illegally secured by var
ious state employes may be returned
to the Oklahoma treasury. This pos
sibility became known through the
legislative probe of corruption, graft
and bribery.
The banaking investigating com
mittee announced “a certain employe
insisted on the committee accepting a
check for $1,500 which represented
funds collected for the state, but ille
gally appropriated to the agent’s
private use.
Legislators say they believe that
sufficient money could be collected to
meet the entire expense of the extra
ordinary session of the legislature.

i
The legislature appropriated $150,000
to finance the session.
With the end of Waltonism the peo
ple of Oklahoma are rapidly getting
back to “normalcy.” With authority
again in the hands of an electorate
rather than in those of a dictator
whose actions were irrational, mar
tial law has come to an end and the
rights of the courts, the legislature,
the press, and the individual now re
ceive merited attention and consider
ation.
Dr. L. H. Henley, of Clarence, Okla.
in a letter accompanied by a manu
script, excerpts from which are print
ed below, says Protestant ranks in his
state have been swelled considerably
by the temporary reign of insanity—
better known as Waltonism. Protest
ant churches are attracting more wor
shipers than ever before; the Klan is
growing in leaps and bounds; Ma
sonry, and the order of DeMolay, as
well as other Protestant fraternities,
have added numerous candidates,
which all goes to show that truth
will win out. Dr. Henley says:
“All who think and observe know
that our governor, instead of saving
the working people the burden of high
taxation, has heaped more upon them
than has any of his predecessors.
“Then, too, we all know that instead
of bringing harmony to our people
by fighting the Klan that be is en
gendering hatred, where there was
no evidence of this before. He has
paid but little attention to the high
jackers, moonshiners and bootleggers,
but has found an excuse for waging
a war against those who were at
peace with him and the moral well
being of the state of Oklahoma and
the world.
“All coercive measures on the part
of the Ku Klux Klan have for quite a
long time been a thing of the past.
It is a known fact that very little
force has been used by Klan members
in its war on vice in Oklahoma, al
though every lawless act is laid at its
door by enemies of Americanism.”
