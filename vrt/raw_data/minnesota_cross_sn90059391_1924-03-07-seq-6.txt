The really vital strength, the true
hope or menace of the Ku Klux Klan
lies in politics. It is there that it
can produce the greatest effect, cause
the most stunning impact on our
lives, exert the deepest influence on
the nation. Its social, economic and
spiritual activities, its terrorism
and boycottings and possible vio
lence are important enough in all
conscience and will make or break
the lives of thousands, but compared
to what it may do in politics they
are trifles. For through politics the
Klan may rule America.
It has already started; it expect
ed to make its rule secure and as
complete »s it wishes within a sin
gle year!
This hope is no wild dream. In so
ber truth there is a very fair chance
that the Klan may succeed. It will
surely go far toward it, though just
how far no one can even guess till
the smoke has blown away after the
November elections. But its success
will be startling unless there comes
one of those miracles which are al
ways possible in politics, and almost
never happens. In fact the chance
for a sweeping Klan victory—no mat
ter which party wins—is about as
good as the chance that McAdoo will
get the democratic nomination. This
does not imply that he is the Klan
candidate —it has not yet picked its
man —but illustrates how well justi
fied is its hope of winning in the
play of skill and run of luck in our
great national poker game.
The Klan’s political power is al
ready large, for, as was pointed out
in >the first article of this series, it
has elected men of its choice to con-

It will make a new person of you—and the result is
accomplished in a natural and simple manner. If
you have never tried this better road to health, bet
ter begin now.
trolling places in six states, has do
minated the elections in half a hun
dred congressional districts and has
won complete victories in many hun
dreds of towns, counties and small
cities, to say nothing of throwing the
whole political world into spasms.
It has already shown power, in short,
about three times that of the Non-
Partisan league and double that of
the Populists in their best days.
But this is only the beginning. At
the coming elections the Klan ex
pects —not “hopes” but confidently
expects —to win more than twenty
states, most of the local elections in
side those states and hundreds out
side, and considerably more than
half of the congressional districts. It
even expects that the next president
will be a man of whom it approves
and who sympathizes with it, even if
it can not pick him singlehanded.
Impossible, you say? Quite likely, yet
the Klan could fall far short of this
and still very justly claim that it
was in a position to rule the coun
try.
It is not impossible, however. The
Klan’s present political power has
been won with far fewer members
than answer its roll-calls today. Two
years ago in the congressional elec
tion it had less than 200,000 votes.
Last fall, when it scored so heavily,
it had about 3,000,000. Today it has
some 4,500,000 and by election time
it confidently counts on having 12,-
000,000. This doubtless includes
many un-hatched chickens, but even
if the Klan growth continues at the
average rate of the last three
months—and the rate has increased
steadily during that time—it will
have close to 9,000,000! And nine
million votes is more than a third
of the largest vote ever cast. Clever
ly used it can get almost anything.
When we recall the influence that
has been exerted by the two million
German hyphenates or the three
million Jews ,the possible power of
nine million Klansmen, or even of
eight, or seven, or five—begins to be
clear.
The Klan intends to win. Its lead
ers believe that a victory will give it
freedom from the persecutions and
prosecutions which have plagued it
so far, give it a chance to consolidate
its power and trim off its excres
cences and to make certain reforms
they dare not attempt just yet, and
let it prove the worth of its theories
and programme. More, they believe
that they will have difficulty in even
holding the organization together
without a victory, and that it is ab
solutely necessary if they are to
keep growing. They realize, too,
how fast their mushroom growth will
crumble under adversity. For all
these reasons they are gambling
heavily on this one card.
So they have focused all their ef
forts on politics. TTiey do not admit
it, but I am convinced that this is the
true explanation of several of the
present abuses of the Klan; the ac
ceptance of riff-raff members, the
carelessness about collecting dues
and even initiation fees, the toler
ance of grafters and self-seeking
leaders in minor places. All will
help at the election, therefore all
will be tolerated till then. Then
the Klan will clean house.
This explains, too, the present tre
mendous pressure behind kluxing,
whic u is absorbing most of the funds
of the Order, the devotion of the
great secret information service to
the collection of political “dope,” the
transfer to Washington of most of
the high executives (official head
quarters remain at Atlanta but lit
tle is done there.) the busy establish
ment of the Klan-controlled press,
and a dozen other lesser symptoms.
If the Klan fails to achieve its poli
tical ambitions, it will not be for
want of using every ounce of
strength it possesses.
All this, however, does not mean
that the Klan intends or wants to
rule the country in the full sense,
in the sense in which a political
party takes over control. On the con
trary its aims are very strictly lim
ited, at least for the time being.
Dr. Evans states its position in an
apparent contradiction.
“The Klan is not in politics,” he
and other leaders have said over and
over again. Yet he goes on: “It is
clear that the Klan programme must
result in political action and can be
carried out in no other way.”
His meaning is that the Klan
operates in politics, not as a party,
but as a non-partisan, mugwamp, op
portunist band of guerillas. It does
not want, at least not yet, the full
responsibilities of government, it
does not want to face the need of
dip* ibuting patronage, it does not
wish to have to find solutions for all
the controversial issues now in poli
tics, and try to unite its members on
them, and it does not have to hold
its organization together, as a poli
tical party does, by the use of place,
pork or pie. What it does want is
to free itself from government op
position to put into effect its pro
gramme of “native, white, protest
ant, Americanism.” to make some gen
eral reforms, and to be able to claim
a victory. It is playing for results
alone, while the ordinary political
party must play for offices.
In this sense it is not in politics.
But it must be able to control offi
cials and legislatures if it is to put
into effect any of the policies on its
national programme, or if it is even
to make more than a temporary sue-

Wb+.d .“OPEN HOUSE” WILL BE MAINTAINED IN INTEREST OF PARTY BY DEMOCRATIC WOMEN
The photograph above was taken
on the day the new clubhouse for
Democratic women was opened in
Washington, D. C. Ac ontinuous
salon in the interests of the Demo
cratic party will be conducted there.
Visitors from all parts of the United
cess out of its local reform cam
paigns. And in this sense it is very
completely in politics.
This self-denying attitude in re
gard to spoils and full power is not
due to virtue alone. It is forced by
the very nature of the Klan itself,
by the fact that the membership is
almost equally divided between de
mocrat and republican. The mom
ent that any attempt is made to take
up issues which have became parti
san or even any which are outside
the platform on which the Klan was
built and is united, the moment that
its power is turned to picking plums,
above all at the first suspicion that
its leaders are favoring either party,
at that moment its membership
would be split into a dozen bickering
factions and its power would vanish.
The Klan may be able to win on its
present limited programme, but it
cannot, on the basis of any develop
ment now in sight, attempt anything
more.
This is equally true whether the
leaders recognize it or not. If Dr.
Evans and the rest ever do yield to
the constant pressure on them and
“broaden out” the Klan plans, there
will be another article to write
about it—an obituary notice. Its dy
ing struggles might, it is true, pro
duce results in strange fields, but
till they begin the Klan can have
almost no political effect outside its
own field.
There is proof of this in the fall ot
the Know-Nothings, to revert once
more to that ill-fated'' fore-runner
of the Klan. The sudden collapse of
that movement was entirely due to
the mistake of attempting too much.
So long as the organization remained
secret and stuck to its own issues it
grew fast and wielded a mighty pow
er. But the early successes went to
the heads of the leaders and they
came into the open as a political
party—the “American party.” For a
year or two their power did increase,
but by that time tne seeds of trouble
had germinated and ripened. Inter
nal jealousies festered, the attempt
to graft on new issues split off large
sections, the desire for offices and
the compromises made to win them
took the life out of the original pur
poses, and in the end an effort to
save votes by straddling on the slav
ery issue- gave the death blow. The
movement would have been destroy
ed equally surely, however, which
ever way it turned. The mistake
was in getting into a position where
it was forced to take a stand on an
issue different from that which had
built it up; in forgetting that a
movement based on one strong idea
will be cut in two as soon as another
one is foistered into its programme.
The more important of the Klan
leaders recognize this limitation,
and are busy trying to hold their fol
lowers to it.
“If the Klan should ever make the
fatal mistake of identifying itself
with either party” Dr. Evans told
me, “or with any cause except the
fundamental issue of Americanism, it
would invite division in its own
ranks, destroy its own power and in
sure its dismemberment.”
Many Klansmen, of course, even
many lesser leaders, do not see this
or ignore it for selfish reasons. The
most numerous breed of parasites
with which the Klan is afflicted is
composed of cheap politicians who
see a chance to get jobs or graft
they have been unable to reach in
ordinary politics, or to hold on to
places they are in danger of losing.
Blatherskites, crooks, grafters,
chronic kickers, chronic candidates,
has-beens and all the flotism of poli
tical life have grabbed at the Fiery
Cross as a hope of salvation. They
are so obstroperous that one politi
cal observer told me that in his state
the whole Klan movement was “an
attempt of the political scrap-heap
to seize the government.” Along
with these, too, there has gone into
the Klan a swarm of fanatics and
world-eavers who are trying to get
it to support every known crack
brained and half-baked reform. Wit*

THE FIERY CROSS
States, allied with the party, will
make this their headquarters while
in the nation’s capital. The engrav
ing of the late President Wilson seen
hanging on the wall was presented
by his widow. The president of the
club, Mrs. J. Borden Harriman, is
port, and the attempt to suppress all
private schools in Oregon.
This noisy and pestiferous crew,
however, do not represent either the
great body of the Klan or its nation
al leadership. They are apparently
tolerated, as such are always tolerat
ed in new political movements, for
the sake of their votes. It was their
presence in the Progressive party, I
believe, which led Roosevelt to coin
the label “lunatic fringe.” Certain
ly hoboes as well.
In fact, there are many other ways
in which the Ku Kiux Klan move
ment resembles the Progressive par
ty. It contains about the same basic
elements of partly dissatisfied and
partly idealistic middle class folks,
as well as the same fringes. Its
gatherings give the same appear
ance and feeling. It is strong in about
the same parts of the country, and
it sings “Onward Christian Soldiers”
just as indefatigably as the Bull
Moosers did. It has much of the
same naive, inexperienced, youthful
vigor.
All these conditions in the mem
bership limit not only the pro
gramme of the Klan in politics, but
also the demands it may make on
candidates, bosses or men in office.
Its political record so far shows that
it has very largely respected these
limits. It can seldom nominate its
own man, for example, as that would
aid one party or the other. It can
not pick the men whom it is going
to support on any party basis, but
only on the basis of their ability and
willingness to support the Klan pro
gramme, and their general fitness.
The church-going quality of most
Klansmen makes personal character
unusually important for candidates
in Klan territory, and is likely to
enforce more than usually decent ad
ministration from officials. It also
gives the Klan a political morality
rather above the average, which is
no very great praise. There are
cases, of course, as in other similar
movements, when very decent citi
zens overlook all other qualifications
in a candidate except his support of
their pet ideas. Tnis has caused
some curious situations, like those in
the Anti-Saloon League campaigns
where the churches have united be
hind men who were complete scala
wags except for their willingness to
vote for prohibition.
The Klan very naturally will sup
port Klansmen where possible, but
it has often refused to do this and
has even voted for non-Klansmen (in
at least one case for anti-Klan man)
when it thought them better, even
against Klan members. But I have
learned of no case where it gave
support to a man who was not a na
tive, white, Protestant. It takes
pains to see that there is at least
one such in every race.
When the Klan does move in poli
tics, that is when it takes a hand in
the selection or election of candi
dates or influencing officials, it
brings to bear a pressure such as al
most no other organization, even one
of the great parties, can apply. All
its organized unity, all its ability to
strike suddenly and in the dark, all
its secret information and its ter
rorism, are more effective here than
in ordinary life, for politicians are
by nature a very timid tribe. The
Klan, too, can use not only this stun
ning political battle ax; it can add
to that the whole social and econ
omic power described in the last
article. Political bosses, it is true,
often use similar additional means
of coercing candidates and officials,
but few are ever able to do it with a
tithe of the force, and none of them
with the demoralizing terrorism that
the Klan commands.
In politics, as in boycotting, the
Klan claims no actual control over
its members. It does not officially
tell them how to vote, any more
than It tells them to withhold trade
from a business man. It merely gives
them information, sometimes advice,
and they are “free to »ct upon it as
they see fit.” It also “educates” them
as to the desirability of acting on
this information and advice.
I asked Dr. Evans how far the
shown at the extreme right of the
picture. Others in the group, from
left to right, are: Mrs. Ollie James,
Mrs. A. A. Jones, wife of the senator
from New Mexico, and Mrs. John B.
Kendrick, wife of the senator from
Wyoming.
Klan controlled the political action
of its members.
“None whatsoever, so far as actual
control is concerned,” he replied.
“No obligation of a Klansman, noth
ing in his oath or understanding re
quires of him or contemplates that
he shall accept the information and
educational facts presented to him
through the Klan as final. The whole
thought is to develop a mind that
will express itself through an elec
torate fully informed.”
“The actual strength of the Klan,”
he went on “depends upon the ex
tent to which Klansmen have been
educated to their duties as citizens
and how they respond to information
given by Klan officials. This is al
ways uncertain but experience indi
cates that these are generally ac
cepted, and will be so long as they
represent in the minds of the Klans
men themselves true American
ideals. In the present state of public
opinion this means that the Klan
can profoundly influence results in
twenty-one states.”
There will be more states in that
list before election.
So far as I can learn Dr. Evans is
correct in saying that the Klan does
not give orders but information. Cer
tainly it has much information to
give and it trices great pains in put
ting it out. Since it is secret it
would easily be possible to give false
information of a kind that might be
exceedingly dangerous, but I cannot
find that it does so, at least so far
as actual candidates are concerned.
I have learned of several instances
in which it has circulated just be
fore an election a report on candi
dates much like the reports put out
by Citizens' Committees and similar
bodies. I saw one such and have re
ports on others. They were all start
lingly detailed, intimate and exhaus
tive, but rather amazinly fair. The
one I saw was put out in Oklahoma
in the heat of a bitter fight, but
there was no trace of • partisanship
visible. It gave both the personal
and political record of each man, his
affiliations in business, society, reli
gion and politics, and his relations
with the Klan. I was particularly
impressed with the fact that when \
man had joined the Klan under cir
cumstances which indicated that his
purpose had been to get political
support that fact was indicated. In
several such cases the advice was
that he should be beaten. So far as
I could judge by that report, it was
a valuable and trustworthy guide for
any voter.
Incidentally, even if the advise
Riven is bad, the training given vot
ers by this system is a very consider
able service to the community. If
the Klan should succeed in teaching
its members to judge candidates on
any other basis than that of “regu
larity" and back-scratching and pie
gathering ability, it would do much
for the future of democracy.
The actual political attitude of
Klansmen as I have seen them ap
pears to be much more docile and de
pendent than Dr. Evans states, how
ever. Even on the night before elec
tion they are likely as not to know
what they are going to do at the
polls; they are “waiting for the
word.” Possibly this is merely in
formation and advice Dr. Evans des
cribed, but the attitude was that of
soldiers waiting for and ready to car
ry out orders. So it seems that in
political practice as it was with the
application of a boycott, it makes
little difference in results whether
“the word” is a command or a bit of
information or advice.
There is, on the other hand, some
doubt about how far the Klansmen
will follow the lead given. I n one
case in Oklahoma a Klan«n,a n and
a man whom the Klan opposed, run _
ning on the same ticket, finished on
ly a few hundred votes apart. There
have been other cases where the ap
parent voting strength of the Klan
was nil. But these are exceptions
possibly due to lack of “education”
or more subtle factor; they <| o prove
that the Klansmen seem to f e „j ua _
der no obligation to follow their
leaders in politics beyond a i*olnt
which they the individual KUnsman
- determine for themselves. This is
important in showing the limits of
thr Klan leaders’ power.
In general, however, in nearly nine
ty per cent of the cases I have been
aide to check, the Klan apparently
h.*' cast a practically solid vote.
T 1 -is is increasingly true, and the
Gi a rid Dragon of Oklahoma told me
tl a by next fall the entire member
ship would be educated, and “ready
ami able to make proper use of in
formation given them.” Dr. Evans
adds that the Klan usually casts
n re than its own vote.
1 We have found by experience” he
ret arked, “that when a Klan issue
i- aised or when the Klan becomes
a* ve in a political campaign, the
a> ’ lal pro-Klan vote will be much
larger than the numerical strength
of the Klan itself, and sometimes
many times as large.” It should be
a ied that the Klan officials declare
that the Klan itself has never been
all wed to become an issue, or a
h insman to run as such, unless an
attack had been made on it. I have
n<'t found a case in which this was
not true.
I'his very considerable ability of
th“ Klan to use almost full strength
in local and state elections, however,
must be discounted when we come to
c isider a national race. In the local
elections party loyalty is compara
tively weak. How far the Klan edu
cat ion would be able to swing the
\ tes of members in the partisan
heat of a national election is a very
different question, and there has
been no demonstration on which an
answer might be based. Politicians
and observers disagree on that. It
seems fair to say that most of them
declare the Klan can safely be ignor
ed in national politics, but few of
them act that way!
When it comes to the actual pow
er of the Klan in political action
the fact that it is not a party, does
nut want full control or offices, and
therefore does not need an actual
plurality of votes, gives it great ad
vantages toward the results it does
demand. It leaves room for deals;
for politicians to submit and yet
save their faces. And a minority,
willing to swing to either party a
solid block of votes, is in a far bet
ter position to get those results than
even a party majority would be. The
Anti-Saloon League has given the
n,ost convincing proof of this. Such
a body can threaten both parties,
quite likely secure pledges or dictate
nominations on both sides, and be se
cure of victory whichever wins. If
either party or candidate balks, it
can usually swing enough votes to
beat him.
The political law on which this
minority power—the power of any
minority—is based is the very ABC
of American politics, yet so often
forgotten that I may be pardoned for
recalling it. It is that control of
one half of the moveable or floating
vote In any electorate gives politi
cal control. For example, in most
elections the two great parties are
fairly evenly balanced, party loyalty
holding something like 40 per cent of
the voters to each. The election
then will be decided among the re
maining twenty per cent, and any
one who controls one vote more than
half of them can throw victory
whichever way he pleases. The man
who wins must take his orders both
before and after election.
The actual figures vary, of course,
but the fact always is that victory
does not depend on winning a ma
jority of the voters, but a majority
of those who are not party-bound.
Hence it is that any small and com
pact minority is usually able to get
what it wants. The Klan’s strength
is that it has gathered such a min
ority.
But the Klan’s weakness is in tne
one exception to this rule; rather in
its corollary. This is that the min
ority power fails as soon as there Is
formed another group, equally large,
and determined to vote against the
first group. If the two balance, both
can be ignored. In practice this
seldom happens. Pro-Germans, for ex
ample, were long able to act as a
unit, while the rest of us were divid
ed over tariff, conservation, or some
other matter. In local politics the
“liquor vote” —and today the “boot
leg vote”—can win easily in any
campaign which divides the elector
ate on any other issue. Our politics
has thus become full of minority
groups for which there is no offset:
racial, religious, business, farming,
labor or whatnot, each without any
corresponding group of “antis.” Poli
ticians and office holders cater to
them all; they must for if one is
lost there is nothing to take its
place.
In case of the Klan, however, this
law of opposition groups works with
full force. The Klan automatically
raises up its opponents; more accur
ately it is an opposition group itself;
its chief object being to strike at
certain of the groups already active,
so that its balancing blocs are ready
made. Many politicians therefore
believe that they can win by defying
the Klan and rallying all these
groups behind them. As this is writ
ten there are indications that the
northern democratic leaders—Mur
phy, Sullivan, Taggart and their al
lies —are preparing to do this. Their
plan is certainly logical, for in the

CLARKE'S ANTIKLAN
CONGRESS FALLS FLAT
Only 10 Oiit~of*State Delegate*
Attend Insnrgents’
Meeting
(Special Telegram)
ATLANTA, GA.. Feb. 27.—E. Y-
Clarke’s congress called for the pur
pose of investigating alleged irregu
larities in the Knights of the Kw
Klux Klan convened here yesterday,
with only 110 delegates present.
Of this number 100 were member*
of old Atlanta Klan whose charter
has been revoked. The ten visitor*
were said to represent 13 states. They
were accredited as follows: H. T.
Kight. national secretary of Kame
lia, Oklahoma; Jack Jones, Kansa*
City, Kansas and Oregon; William E.
Thompson, Clarke’s “Man Friday,"
Virginia; W. 11. Austin, Durham, rep
resenting the two Carolinas; Billy
Parker, of The New Menace, Missouri,
Arkansas and Tennessee. Pennsyl
vania insurgents were represented by
telegraph, while the Connecticut del
egation sent only a letter. No Geor
gia Klansmen were present other
than members of the banished At
lanta Klan.
E. A. Gray of Denver, representa
tive of Colorado, California, and
Utah, was charged on the floor of
the hall with being a member of an
organization known as the Flaming
Sword. He denied the charge and
made a fight to have Colonel Sim
mons admitted to the hall. He said:
“We have been burned by the fiery
cross, stabbed by the flaming swora,
and I will be hanged if we are go
ing to be lost in the maze of a mys
tjc castle.”
Resolutions were adopted by the
entire assembly scoring the present
administration of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan, Inc., and launching
Clarke’s new organization to be
known as the Knights of the Mystic
Klan.
Strange as it may seem, Clarke did
not appear in the assembly after the
morning session. It was evident that
he was disgusted with the small
showing made by the insurgent
Klansmen. In his talk he made it
clear that he would in no way par
ticipate in the organization work of
the Knights of the Mystic Klan. r
Jack Jones was elected head of the
new organization, and Kansas City,
Kansas, named as its temporary na
tional headquarters. Initiation fee*
were fixed at $lO for aliens, $5 for
Klansmen, and members of Simmons*"
outlaw organization, the Knights Ka
melia, will be taken in free.
