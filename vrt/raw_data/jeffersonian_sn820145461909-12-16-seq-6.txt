•X BROTHER EDITOR GOES AFTER
CHRISTIAN INDEX.
Christian Index, Atlanta, Ga.
Gentlemen:—Would the practical
ly unanimous opinion of the public
that you would be more in line with
your capacity were you plowing an
ox instead of trying to run a “Chris
tian” newspaper effect a material
change in your career? Is it bigotry
or beans that prompts your unfair,
unmanly attitude towards Mr. Wat
son and Foreign Missions? Is it not
your business “discretion,” rather
than intolerance, that freezes the
Watson side of the question from
your columns I am charitable
enough to Relieve that it isn’t both
at one time!
If I should maliciously attack the
integrity of one of the editors of the
Index in this newspaper, would it be
in line with the teachings of the
Bible and the Caucasian creed of a
square deal, for me to close my col
umns absolutely to you? Jack John
son, the negro pugilist, is entitled to
that much and would get it in every
other publication in America, from
Greer’s Almanac to the Homely La
dies’ Journal—except, possibly, The
Christian Index.
It’s just my newspaper instinct and
Americanism that prompts me to butt
in here. Think over that “ox team
and sandy bottom” proposition
brother, and let me know how you
feel about it.

REGRET THE MISFORTUNE OF A
FRIEND.
Dear Sir: —I' am inclosing my
check for one dollar to renew my
subscription to the weekly, and to
get your knife.
I had my home and all I had burn
ed on the 16th of October and I am
mighty poor, but I don’t feel like I
can stay without your writings, as
they keep me posted on so many
things.
Hoping you may live long to edu
cate the people, I am
Yours truly,

“TELL YOUR SOCIALIST NEIGH
BOR ABOUT THIS.”
Dear Sir:—My old friend, and one
time neighbor, Mr. A. J. Graves of
Houston county, Texas, called on me
the other day, and, by the way, he
was about converted to Socialism,
and upon his mentioning the fact to
me, I picked up my latest weekly
Jeffersonian and showed him your
editorial, “Tell Your Socialist Neigh
bor about This.”
Well, he began reading, read a lit
tle, and then snorted, and finally
blurted out, “Why, Tom Watson is
sadly mistaken. There isn’t a decent
person living that would stand for
any such rot as that free love,” etc.,
etc. “Just read on,” say» I, “don’t
judge yet.” He read it all, and call
ed on me again the next day and
asked me for that paper. And I let
him have it. He said he was going
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
to send that to Dick Maple, of the
Ripsaw, lor him to answer. But my
friend called again on the day that
the November Jeffersonian Magazine
arrived, and he read your editorial
on Socialism in that. I think that
did the work, as I heard him say
that he was going to quit the Rip
saw.
For fear that you might overlook
it, I will say that some one has given
you a little “jacking-up” in The Texas
Farm Co-operator of November 10.
I have taken the Farmers’ Union
obligation myself, and am just as
anxious for its success as I am able to
be, se it does me good to see you
throw it into the Ship Subsidy
thieves and other enemies of the
farmers. Also the farmers, for be
ing suckers.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. STEM.

FOREIGN MISSIONS LOSING
GROUND; THE PREACHERS
SHOULD RETURN TO THE
APOSTOLIC MODEL.
Dear Sir: —Being anxious to get
your literature before the people, I
want to put you in touch with the
Rev. S. J. Cowan. He is a great ad
mirer of you and your literature, and
can do you more good than any man
I know of.
He is a traveling preacher, but is
now working for the Farmers’
Union. He will be at your place next
Monday, November 15th.
You see him in person if possible,
and engage his services, as he will be
in twenty or thirty counties on this
tour.
If you can get him to work for
you, he can do you a great service,
as he is a man of great energy and
the hardest to resist of any man I
ever saw.
He is getting in line with you on
this Foreign Mission question, and
will state right here that you have
set the woods on fire down here on
this question.
The preachers say they can not
collect any mission money, for Tom
Watson has torn the thing to pieces.
I will state also that the Rev.
Cowan is one of your recent con
verts, and is one of the boldest, in
dependent men I ever saw.
I will state further that your lit
erature gets more interesting every
issue, and I have taken every paper
you ever published, and will say
further (without flattering) that I
admire you more than any man liv
ing or dead. Wishing you success in
your work, I am
Respectfully yours,
J. M. M. CHRISTIAN.

WHEN WILL THE MASSES REAL
IZE THEIR POWER?
Dear Sir:—l am sending herewith
the necessary funds to set my sub
scription to both Jeffersonians up one
year. I have taken about every is
sue of every paper and magazine you
ave edited, and I expect to continue
to do so as long as I am able to pay
for them.
I admire your style of skinning
GW
rascals and scoring traitors (especial
ly those of the South), exposing evil
and exalting that which is just and
true and honest. Were it not for
you and the Jeffersonians the lid
would scarcely ever be lifted high
enough for the common people to get
even a squint at the corruption Ex
isting in the political, social and re
ligious pots. And while it is a fact
that you, like all other men, some
times make mistakes, yet it is also
a fact that your lifevzork has been
an unwavering contention for govern
mental and moral principles, which,
if carried out, would bring untold
blessings to the burden-bearers, and
also exalt our whole country. But
you are only a seed-sower. While a
few faithful friends are holding up
your arms in the thankless yet heav
enly work, the great mass whom you
would bless are toiling on like stupid
asses, and patient oxen, bearing their
burdens and saying, by both word
and action, “It is right.”
But, though you may never see
much fruit of your labors (and you
never will politically), yet continue
to sow. The good seed will germi
nate after awhile, and the world will
be better by your having been faith
ful. I would rejoice if you could live
to see a great wave of reform sweep
over our beloved country; but you
nor I will live long enough for that.
The people lack a whole lot of being
ready for it. In fact, about fourteen
million men said by their votes last
November that they actually didn’t
want any reform, and everything was
lovely. There were a few millions
who wanted to change the thing up
a little, and be robbed by the other
crowd for a few years. For proof, see
Acts of Extra Session of Congress.
Talk about reform politically at this
time! One might about as well ex
pect to empty the Pacific Ocean with
a squirtgun, such as we used -when
we were boys.
There was a time when the reform
move had plutocracy frightened bad
ly, but Bryan and fusion, and a few
traitors, and a whole lot of money,
and, I reckon the devil to lead the
opposition, succeeded in killing it out,
and it is just too dead to skin yet.
But work on, w r ork ever; a clean
record and a clear conscience are
worth more than gold or political
preferment.
Yours' till death,
N. J. BELTON.

AFTER ALL, HUMAN NATURE IS
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
EVERYWHERE.
Dear Sir: —I have received anoth
er Jeffersonian, for which I do thank
you. The weather here is wet and
cold, and the corn I spoke of that
I would sell as soon as I could get
in the field is not gathered, but I am
going to gather it as it dries
up so that it will keep in the crib
and not rot. Corn is scarce here,
and I don’t think I will have much
trouble to sell all that I will have
to spare, so if you continue sending
the paper, I will pay for it as soon as
I do sell it. But it will not insult
me if you don’t send it, because you
don’t know me, and may not feel
safe in trusting me.
The first article I saw in the pa
per was the horrible doings of three
negroes to a white man and his wife,
and the actions of the good people
in the community in which they
lived. They acted precisely like
they felt it their duty to act, and did
it for a reward not to be paid to
them in money, but to be placed to
their credit hereafter. The soldiers
that refused to obey orders and shoot
the good neighbors of this outraged
man and woman, I believe God will
reward also. This case furnishes
plain evidence that there are plenty
of good people in all places to mete
out justice to all sorts of criminals.
A real good man don’t want any
earthly pay for doing his duty,—he
loves to do it so well that in ex
treme cases he will ignore all hu
man fix-ups in order to get to do it.
Very truly yours,
J. G. CASE.

GLAD JO MAKE FRIENDS OF THE
NEIGHBORS OF JOEL B. FORT.
Dear Sir: —Long live the Jeffer
sonians, and my best wishes to their
editor. Thou hast almost persuaded
me to be a Populite!
Mr. Watson, I feel that I know you
well through the description of our
mutual friend, the Honorable Joel B.
Fort, who is my neighbor. I was
persuaded by him to take the Jeffer
sonians, and they are both watched
for and read eagerly, especially your
articles on “Missions” and “Social
ism” but the article on “The Buz-
, *
zard” has well repaid me the cost of
my subscription.
I am with you in most all the
things that you say, and I will get
you subscribers whenever I can.
Your friend,
W. H. HOOK.

A CHRONIC “KICKER”.
Dear Sir: —You are certainly wak
ing some people up on Missions and
Socialism. Your Jeffersonians ought
to be in every home.
I hope the day may soon come
when the people of this priest-ridden
country will cease to be blinded by
prejudice and are open to conviction
of the truth. Hope your Magazine
and Weekly will continue to grow in
popularity, and I wish you God speed
in the great work.
One of our little preachers, W. M.
Samples, in asking for mission mon
ey, told his congregation not to pay
any attention to Tom Watson, as he
was a chronic kicker. I thank God
that we have one man in our broad
land who is not afraid to give us the
truth, though it makes some of them
squirm like a sick kitten in hot
ashes.
Yours till the finish,
W. R. YOUNG.

Mr. Watson’s purpose is to save
the Fanners’ Union from certain
traitors WHO ARE STEERING IT
TOWARD THE ROCKS. The organ
ization itself, and the honest men
who are members of it, have no truer
friend than The Jeffersonian.
