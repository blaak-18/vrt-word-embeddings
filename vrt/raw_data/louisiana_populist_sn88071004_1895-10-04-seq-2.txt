FRIDAY, OCT. 4, 1I193.
Go to the primary to-morrow
(.aturd(ay) and vote for your choice.
If the silver forces in the Denl
,eratic party are (lefeatod it will
1E ,n account of fraud and the il
legitimnate use of money and pat
r mnate. If this will not justify
the masses in leaving the party we
don't know what would. l..very
man who has backbone will do so.
- ()lla 1ignal.
A long winded farmer in our
E:nterlrise says a crop can be
made in i3} days. and that the la
borer get. $24 per month. Will
he please tell us what he does with
the other 2911 days, and how much
Iw gets per day. Makes 4 more
cro1 thle samne year f A good
minnv persons have asked the
qies tion. Please answer.
You can hire two men one day
for two dollars now. Formerly
you could hire but one man one
tay for two dollars. Are men de
preciating. -Appeal to Reason.
We should smile. A laborer
gets fifty cents down here, and the
stableman charges one dollar per
day for a horse. According to
this, a man is worth half as much
as a horse, or about thirty dollars.
Why, a common negro slave used
to be worth three or four hundre'
dollars. Money must have ap
preciated, or men depreciated.
Fine state of affairs, when two
men are worth only one horse.
In answering an article in the
Enterprise of September 19th, re
Seeting upon our nominees for
Justices of the Peace in two coun
try warns, we have been scoused
oi misquoting. We made no ef
fort to quote, but simply took the
article for the meaning it intend
ed to convey. The foilowing is
its languse:
"We have been reliably inform
ed that the Populists have, in at
least two mistances nominated for
Justiese of the Peace men who
ca barely write their names."
Draw your own inferences.
Our esteemed neighbor 'mmst be
ioknag by inviting all free coinage
Popalists, which means all Popu
lists, to come back to the Demo
emratie fold. It has never advoes
ted the free and unlimited coinage
ata ratio of 16 to 1. Dos not
mwat a white primary, and eonse
quantly, iadirectly favormoe sys
meshing against fraudulent .lec
riot"
It's h-1 and high water seditori
l maode a good many Pop's feel
like coming back. We premsme it
wamts P tobe on hand whenm the
-ta omesm o to furnish the
ow-4 to take water no matter
how itL will be.

OUR PRIMARIES.
'n Saturday, ()ctober 5th. the
Populists of old Natchitoches par
ish will select their standard bear
ers for the approaching campaign.
Every person who has heretofore
affiliated with the People's party,
or who desires in future to do so, is
invited to participate in this se
lection.
The humblest man in the party'
will vote on an equality with the
shrewdest or wealthiest, and his
vote will count for as much. T'he
voice of the people will be heard,
and will become the law of the
party, which is true L)emocracy.
The schemes and combines and
dlickers of conventions will Ibe un
known, and the voter will vote di
rect for his choice. and have it
counted.
The conventi n which follows
the primary will only complete the
work which the primary fails to
accomplish, and will re-orgamnlze the
party for the campaign.
Before the people in this prima
ry, are ocod men and true, for the
offices of Clerk and Sheriff. Eve
ry one of these men is thoroughly
identified with the interests of our
parish, is fully completent to till
the office to which he aspires, and
would be an honor to the party if
electel.
The campaign for the most part
has been conducted upon an honor
able plane, and free fron any and
all bitterness, and it will be no
Strouble for the party ranks to close
up after next Saturday, and march
on to victory next April.
We hope that everybody will
turn out and( exercise his choice in
this primary, because we honestly
believe the ticket selected will win.
and we would like it to be a thor
oughly representative ticket-the
choice of the majority of the peo
ple.
We have our personal choice
among the candidates, and we would
like very much to see them win,
but if they do not, we will grace
fully submit to the will of the ma
jority, and work only the harder
for the success of our ticket. We
would injure only ourselves by
lagging or sulking over defeat in
the primary. "As ye would have
others do to your choice if he were
to win, do ye even so to theirs" is
the golden rule in this instance.
PoruusLrs OF NATCHITC'HE$, DO
YOUR WHOLE DUTY NEXT SATUR
DAY, AND OUR BATrLE 18 HALF WON i
Want Argument.
For the want of argument the
big guns of the Democratic party
bring up some of the silliest trash
against the Populists that any
school boy ever made use of in
"Kangaroo kort."
Think of U. S. Senator Blan
charci footing up all the bills ever
introduced by Populists in Con
gress, sad claiming that the total
was the amount of money which
they desired to appropriate !
The Populists have too much
real argument against the Demo
crats to fool away time with such
nonsense. If they were to add up
the appropriations called for by
one year's offer of Democratic
bills, it would stretch the Arabic
system of notation to express the
amount, one bill (Senator Palmer's)
calling for 68 billions, but we are
too much worried with the size of
actual appropriations made by them
to Carnegie, Havemeyer,. Roths
child& Co., to notice their at
tempted measures.
A Ia .umehard
The first guu of the empagn
should havebeen fired in Caddo at
the great vindication meethigs. It
was expected that the echo of that
gun would have set North Louisi
ana in a bla~e of entiusiasm for
the political machine, but the farst
gun was peterpd and the glbrious
enthusiasm is still shrouded in
doubt and uncertsjinty. The first
gunsm have bee 6red in Rapides
and in Natchitoches, but the echoes
have so furhad no elect in rous
ing the umtariled to action.

Friend or Foe ?
Our neigh;or. the linte'rprise.
was a single st:andard org:an,; it
inadle no prettention to be an> thing
else; its policy not being in accord
with the silver Ielemocrats of this
parish, a D)emoratic Execuitive
C'onmmittee somnetinie in July, got
together and controlled its (dito
rial columns, put in an editor, who
in his s:lutatorv assured tlhat it
would advocate a 1 imet alic stand
ardi; so far, so good,. Take its
uIttceralnles since the ichm: ne wias
orade.
1st. A free silver )al)per, it Ie
rins by abusing ain ridliculing the
only party having si silver plank.
viz : the Popu)list.
2nd. It has attackedl repl:te li
ly, the leading lIemiocratic silver
palrs in lthe late. tilthe Tiil:es
Democrait riiciially, bIeclause it
favoredl a white lrimarii:yr and the
injection of silver in the State
campaiitin.
:trl. It refusiied to puilli<h at
first the proceedings of ita I)eio
r:atic llllnetallic leagtue, and only
did so when it was made known
that the Porl' i.lsT would puldisli
themn, then, it separated the redlui
tions from the nallmes, )pu1liIhed
the former one week, the latter
the next.
4. The very fact of it's qlotin
from aiid lcinii quolited by gold Iy l
org:ins is c(irenuiiiitant ial evid hence
enough to convict it of adlvocatingl
a gold standard or leaninig that
3. It has never declared that it
favored the free and unliiited
coin:'ge at the ratio of Il; to 1.
Nerer. Yet this paper has the sulp
)oirt of a School Board and Police
. urv of a parish largely in favor
of free silver, circulates among
the farmners, an element largely
against the single standard, and is
extensively patronized eby ardent
silverites. Feeding an enemy
helping it to fight you.
If we have made any assertions
in this that our neighbor doubts,
let it come out and say which one.
We never say anything we are un
able to plrove. Let it come out
and say-- We beliere and ad rocate
the free and unlimited coinage ofi
silrer at a ratio of i; 1. Unless
it does so, the people of this coln
try can and will class it with the
oplposition or single standard gold
organs.

FORREST hIit.., LA.,
September 30, 18935.
Editor Louisiana Populist :
The People's party club of this
places numiber 25, and still growing.
The peoplle seem to be more inter
ested than ever, they have conm
menced to think, and you know
that thinking people soon become
Populists. e1 are to have a
grand rally here on October 12th,
and ye editors especially invi
ted to attenld.
Yours for reform,
AGITATOR.
Governmscnl OwnCrt.e*a f Raril
roads No Good.
The government owns and ope
rates the railroads, street railways,
wate.works, docks, telegraphs,
telephones, etc. i here are 2,577
nmiles of railroad in the Colony, of
which but 34 miles are owned by
private parties. In 1894 there
were 17,000,000 passengers car
ried at one and two-tenths cents
per mile.
Total earnings were in 1594 ....£3,818.541
T'otal working exp's in 1894.....2,592,842
Net earnings ...............£11,221699
All government mail and freight
were carried free. All employes
work eight hours per day. Engi
neers receive $.3.30 and common
labor $1.90 per day.
The consul says: "By defying
the cry of socialism the 2overn
ment saved 12,000,000 acres of
valuable land and borrowed money
to build the roads at 4 per cent and
to-day the land which the govern
ment would have hal to give the
corporations to build the roads, is
worth more than the total cost of
the system. New South Wales
owes $230,000,000, but the utili- 1
ties built by this debt yield $2,500,
1)00 annually more than the inter- 1
est on the debt."--From report of
Uinited States Consul at Sidney,
