Hobo Heroes Who Habe Sabed Trains E - L -
Who does not know the railroad
tramp? Ragged, dirty, homeless,
friendless, he shuffles along the
track, glancing askance at you and
avoiding your eye. His only reply to
your questions will probably be a
surly grunt, and the sole topics
on which he will open conversation
with you have'to do with food and
drink, and perhaps a little cast off
clothing.
Yet, unpromising material as he is,
from more than one tramp have come
deeds of 'heroism, of self-forgetful
ness, that have meant the saving of
many lives and the protection of
hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of property. If you don’t be
lieve it, read this article.
Pilgrims of the Rail Who Have Risk
ed Life and Limb To Save the
Lives of Others, and in Most
Cases Without Hope
of Reward.
Half an hour late out of Rochester,
on the evening of August 21, 1904,
the Boston express, with every berth
taken, was rushing along through a
black, foggy night at almost record
speed. A few miles to the east a
tramp was walking the ties. He had
not eaten since morning, and he had
walked many miles. He was weak
from hunger and exhaustion, his feet
ached with every step, and the cold
fog crept through his rags and chilled
him.
It was all he could do to drag him
self along, and he wondered whether
he would be able to reach Palmyra,
where he hoped to get a night’s free
lodging. If he failed, he would creep
into some haystack along the road.
He was Fred Bibby, from nowhere,
bound nowhere, without money or the
hope of it.
Suddenly he stumbled against some-
LOG-CABIN COVERLETS.
The popular log-cabin quilts can
be made of silk strips with a cotton
foundation, or with strips of calico
on the same. Filling in the squares
will prove a diverting occupation for
long winter evenings. The work is
done with overlapping strips that
form these squares, but the colors are
so arranged that when finished each
block appears like four angles of a
diamond, with long bars passing over
one another in the centre, somewhat
like basket-weave. When <all are
joined together the effect is most har
monious. Each square of unbleached
muslin for the foundation must be 7
inches across, the centre of each
square being covered by a. square
piece 2 inches wide, of silk in a del
icate shade. Procure as many strips
of silk or ribbon as possible in va
rious colors 1 1-2 inches wide, and
there you have the
To make the first square, place a
square of pink in the middle, then
run a strip of light blue along one
edge of it, turn over, press flatly with
the thumb and baste it down; this
must be done with each strip. Run a
thing hard between the ties. It was
so dark that he could not see what
it was, and he stooped to grope for
it. As his hands clutched it he gave
a cry of astonishment. It was a piece
of steel rail, and close beside it was
a gap in the track from which it had
been cut.
At the same instant there flashed
thorough his mind a thought of the ap
proaching express. He knew it must
be drawing near, for he had tramped
that division of the New York Central
so many times that he had a fairly
good knowledge of the train schedule.
He realized, too, that that gap in the
rail was wide enough to ditch the
Boston flier if it were not warned in
time, and that probably scores of
passengers would be killed or injured.
It seemed to him that already he
could hear the distant roar of the
train, and he broke into a run. The
nearest station to the west was Wel
worth, half a mile away. Could he
reach it in time? Half a mile on a
night so black that he could barely
see the ties at his feet was a long
way for a man who had tramped all
day without food.
But somehow the responsibility that
had fallen upon him, and the fear of
the disaster that threatened, gave him
strength. He hurried on, stumbling
now and then over a tie, and stopping
sometimes in terror because he fancied
he heard the shriek of the engine.
A Race for a Train.
He knew he could not hold out
much longer. Already his legs were
beginning to bend under him, and his
breath was whistling through his
teeth. And before long he did hear
the engine in terrible reality—a long
drawn screech, far away, to be sure,
but fearfully near in the imagination
of the exhausted tramp.
At the same moment the light of
similar strip along the other side;
place a black strip along the left
side of the last strip, and another
black strip over the remaining side.
This will make two sides light and
two black.
Run a. si rip of dark blue along
Ihe side of the first blue strip you
put on, then the same'shade to the
left of that, next use heliotrope, or a
stripe with a pattern on it, then the
same again to the left —and you have
another square.
Run a yellow 7 strip along each of
the blue sides, then a chocolate brown
strip along each remaining side. Make
three more squares and stitcji them
all together, the yellow in the centre
and chocolate on the outside.
In the second combination make a
square of cream or pale yellow in the
centre, and surround it with two pink
and two black strips. Put two strips
of crimson next to the pink, and two
green beside the black; two lighter
green over the crimson and two
orange over the darker green. Make
three more squares the same, and
stitch them together with the pale
green in the centre z and the orange
on the outside. Proceed in this way,

the station gleamed far ahead. He
felt that he could never reach it, but
he kept on.
A few minutes later E. B. Heney,
the night operator at Walworth, was
startled by a hoarse cry. He rushed
out to the platform, and saw Bibby
tottering toward him out of the
darkness.
“The train! The train!” shouted
Bibby. “Stop it! There’s a going
to be a wreck if you don’t!”
Heney did not wait for explana
tions. He took one look at the
tramp’s white face, heard the roar of
the oncoming express, glanced up the
track at the glaring headlight, and
sprang for a red lantern. Then he
and Bibby rushed out onto the track,
the operator waving his red light
vigorously.
The engineer of the flier saw the
. . . . . x
warning signal just in time —just as
Heney, in despair, was about to spring
out of the way to save himself. The
big train was brought to a stop so
quickly that the passengers were
thrown out of their seats and berths.
And at the same moment the starv
ing, worn-out tramp fell in a faint
on the ties. •
Passengers and crew came hurrying
out on the tracks and crowded around
Heney and his unconscious companion.
The operator was plied with ques
tions, but he could not tell what
the trouble was. The engineer and
the conductor looked at the tramp
and shook their heads skeptically.
Water was thrown in Bibby’s face.
He opened his eyes, and gradually
his senses come back to him. Then
he told of his discovery. ’
Quickly his story spread among the
passengers, who rushed up to
him to shake his hand. Women
crowded around him with tears in
their eyes and called him a hero.
varying the colors according to taste,
only remembering that black is al
ways used for the third and fourth
strips. A spray embroidered on the
four squares of every block will add
greatly to the appearance.—-Paris
Modes.
At last it has come. The flaw in
the diamond. The speck on the clear
pane; the rift within the lute. After
all that has been said and proclaimed
in regard to the Jeffersonian simplic
ity of “the great commoner,” we
find W. J. Bryan making a “roll of
honor” of those who contribute SIOO
or more to the Democratic campaign
fund. No more for him the dollar
dinner. No more thanks to the la
bour who has been wont to drop his
dollar into the hat. These he has for
gotten while feasting his covetous
eyes on the alluring cash of the
wealthy. The “common, people” are
shut out and the man who liquidates
to the tune of a hundred bucks or
better is heralded on a “roll of hon
or” from one end of the country to
tire other. Alas I How have the
mighty fallen! Missouri World,
Chillicothe.
Then a purse was started for him,
and iq a few minutes there was
enough money in it to keep him from
starving for months.
After the rail had been repaired,
Bibby was taken aboard one of the
sleepers and carried to Syracuse.
There he was taken by grateful pas
sengers to the best hotel in the city
and treated to the finest dinner that
he had ever dreamed of. He spent
that night in the best room in the
place.
What Bibby Wanted.
In the morning he found a crowd
waiting for him in the lobby, for the
story of how a tramp had saved the
Boston express from destruction had
spread over the whole city. As he
appeared, a cheer went up that set
the blood tingling in his veins. They
were cheering for him, poor, homeless
Bibby, who, the night before, had
been looking for a free lodging.
After breakfast, he was taken for
an automobile ride. On his return,
he found a representative of the rail
road waiting for him.
“I have been instructed by the
general offices in New York,” said
the caller, “to offer you a pass for
life, good on all the lines controlled
by our company.”
“A pass!” cried Bibby. “What
would I do with a pass? What I
need is a job. I haven’t always been
a tramp. I joined the molders’
union fifteen years ago in Providence,
and I’ve got my card yet.”
The caller went out and wired the
New York offices. The answer came
back, “Give him what he wants.”
The next day Bibby was presented
with a new outfit of clothes and with
free transportation to the railroad’s
shops at Depew, where a job was
waiting for him that he might hold
for life.
SONG OF THE NIGHT.
As if one only of the thrush’s notes
Should linger, through the golden
cadence die
In music faintly visible, there floats
A great star in the amber of the sky.
Star-glow 7 and song—they melt from
sound and sight;
The deep infinity infolds them
round
In darkness yet more beautiful than
light,
And Silence more harmonious than
sound.
So may we pass, in wonder and
afar
When the slow curtains of the
night are drawn,
To sleep beyond the star-dusk and
the star —
that is stranger than
the dawn!
