The Orchestra's Ball.
A ball will be given at Falk's hall
to-night by the Lafayette Orchestra.
The proceeds will go to that splen
did musical organization to pur
chase some instruments. The mem
bers of the orchestra have never
failed to respond when called upon
by the people to assist at entertain
ments or celebrations of a public
nature, and it is to be hoped that
the people of the town will take ad- '
vantage of this opportunity to show
their appreciation. We dare say
that no organization has ever shown
more readiness to help the town
than has the Lafayette Orchestra.
Only a few days ago it generously
volunteered its services to entertain
the Agricultural Society, and it is
no exaggeration to say that it con
tributed largely to the success of i
the session. Upon different oc
casions The Gazette was pleased to
note the public-spirit displayed by
the members of that association.
Let the people of the town turn out I
em masse to-night and attend the I
ball, which promises to be a very
enjoyable affair. The orchestra is I
composed of the following gentle
men: Walter Mouton, leader; Henry
Vander Cruyssen, Charles Jeannard,
Charles Jennaro, Dr. Felix Girard, (
Henri Gerac, Prof. Von Hofe, Ed-.
ward Voorhies, Wm. Campbell and 4

Married.
Mr. Alcide Delhomme and Miss
Azelie Mouton were married Tues
day evening at the Catholic church
at Carencro by the Rev. Father La.
forest. A number of friends and
relatives of the young couple wit
nessed the ceremony that united the
happy pair into the bonds of wed
lock. At night Mr. Numa Breaux
gave a ball in honor of the bride
and groom, who received the con
gratulations of their many friends.
The ball was very largely attended
and it is safe to say that a most
pleasant time was had by all.
The Gazette wishes to Mr. and
Mrs. Delhomme a full share of hap
piness.

nothing need be said in its favor.
Everybody who desires better roads ti
is invited to be present at the meet
ing which will be held at the City '
Hall at a o'clock p. m. on -Tuesday, °
Feb. 4- The business men of this ti
town are especially interested in the t
success of this move, for they, more t
than any other, class, suffer from the d
present condition of the roads. We ti
dare say that hundreds, and perhaps
thousands, of dollars are daily di- U
verted from our trade on account of e
the almost impassable roads leading a
to this town. The Gazette is in
formed that the purpose of this pro- o
posed league is not to antagonize in
any manner the town and parish au- ti
thorities, but rather to assist them. L
The Gazette believes that it the peo- c
ple interested in better roads will u
attend the meeting and join the
league, a good deal can be done in
the way of ameliorating our public
highways, but they must get to
gether and pull together and then tl
substantial results will be bound to 1
come. In our opinion nothing is b
more important than good roads,
and we can not conceive of anything
more necessary to the prosperity of
our town' or country. Our soil is of °
such a nature that comparatively
little labor is. needed to keep the °
roads in good order.
The exposure to all sorts and
conditions of weather that a lumber- °
man is called upon to endure in the s;
camps often produces severe colds [
which, if not promptly checked, re- s
sult in congestion or pneumonia. o

vere cold and obtained immediate a
relief. This medicine prevents any P
tendency of a cold toward pneumo- I

The Arena for February.
The February Arena is probably the most
attractive issue of this great reformative and
progressive review that has yet appeared.
In its 176 pages are found notable papers by
Forbes Winslow, D.C.L., of the Royal Col
lege of Physicians of London, on "Madness
as Portrayed by Shakespere." "The Land
of the "Noonday Sun," by Justice Walter
Clark, L L.D., of the Supreme Bench of
North Carolina (profusely illustrated). Jus
tice Clark has visited Mexico under the
auspices of The Arena to study our sister re
public, and this issue contains the opening
paper of a series which will be magnificently
illustrated, and which we predict will prove
exceedingly interesting to all persons inter
ested in travels and history, as well as social
and economic problems. "The Bond and the
Dollar," by John Clark Ridpath, L.L.D.;
the second paper of a most notable series by
America's most popular living historian.
"Bryant, the Poet and Politician," by Frank
B. Sanborn. "-Personal Reminiscences of
Whittier," by his triend, the Rev. Christo
pher Coffin Hussey (with full-page half-tone
illustration of the old Whittier homestead
and portrait of Mr. Hussey). "The Govern
ment and the Telegraph Monopoly," by
Prof. Frank Parsons of Boston University
School of Law, and containing a vast array
of indisputable facts of unquestionable value
to students of social problems. "Scientific
Theosophy," by Prof. Joseph Rodes Be
chanan, M.D.; a scholarly discussion of a
problem engaging the attention of a large
number of the most thoughtful people at the
present time. "Is Woman Embodied Ob
struction?" by Helen Campbell. "A New
System of State Warrants," by the Hon.
Howard L. Weed, member of the legislature
of the State of Washington; a very thought
ful and suggestive contribution, which will
prove of special interest to independent
thinkers who are interested in financial prob
lems and who desire to bestow prosperity to
all wealth-creators. The Arena's two
serials-"Thle Valley," by Will Allen
Dromgoole, and "Between Two Worlds,"
by Mrs. Calvin Kryder Reifsuider-gain
greatly in mnterest with each succeeding
issue. They are widely different in charac
ter, but both are striking works-one a story
of real life in the mountains of East Tennes
see, and the other a moat fascinating ro
mance dealing with the higher phases of
metaphysical and physical thought, which
are so profoundly stirring many of the best
minds of our times. The book of reviews
also are a strong feature of the issue, occupy.
ing twenty-seven pages.

The Helpless Farmer.
The Southern Farmer.
In a recent issue of the Ruston
Leader the editor remarks that cot
ton is the most helpless crop that
can be raised on the farm. Corn,
wheat, oats, hay and nearly every
thing else, when the market is over
supplied, can be fed to the stock
and to the- family. These things
make not only the farmer in a meas
ure self-supporting, but are power
ful elements of independence to the
country in which they are raised.
The Ruston Leader could hardly
have written -a truer paragraph. It
is one of the most conspicuous facts
in our Southern agriculture that
when the season is finished and the
crop has failed to be lucrative, the
Southern planter is greatly distress
ed in his endeavors to effect credit
arrangements for the coming year.
With diversified agriculture, pro
ducing several crops, some of which
will almost surely succeed, and with
the production in particular of all
those articles that are consumed at
home, and which can be produced
with reasonable economy, the farmer
acquires a degree of independence
that no other class of men possess.
The absolute helplessness of the
man who produces but one crop,
and that a crop that he can not feed
to his stock, and which can only be
sold into the markets of the world
through the usual channels, is a fea
ture of our Southern agriculture
which we trust will be less conspicu
ous in the future than in the past.

Ex-President Harrison writes on 'The
Presidential Oeoie" In his i This Couatry ofat 1
Ours" series, in February Ladies' Home n
Journal. In discussing the eoaistituional
provisionsifor the seletesn aof a Chief Magis
trate, he touches upon the disaiuiom In the
convention relative to a gplurm executive for
the nation, and upon the point presents his
own views: "Experience re so fully justi
fled the conclusion reached by the Constitl
tional convention in this matter [a single es
ecutive head] that no change has ever been
suggested. The incumbent has never satisfied
every one, but the discontented have never I
sought relief by giving him a double. Et
ecutive direction should always be single.
When anything is wrongly dome we must he j
able to put a hand on the man who did it.
The sense ~ responsibility begets careful
ness, and that sense is never so perfect as
when, after full consultation, the officer must
go alone into the chamber of decision. In
all of the recent reform city charters this I
principle is made prominent-by giving the
Mayor the power to appoint the city boards
and officers, and so making him responsible
for the efficiency of the city government.
Two Presidents or three with equal powers J
would as surely bring disaster, aU three Gen
erals of equal rank over a single army. I
do not doubt that this sense of single and
personal responsibility to the people has l
strongly held our Presidents to a good con
science and to a high discharge of their du
ties.
