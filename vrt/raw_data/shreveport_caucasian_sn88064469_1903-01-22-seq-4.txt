'ITHE SOUTH CAROLINA TRAG
ED)Y.
The announcement of the death of N.
C. Gonzales, which occurred at his
home in Columbia. S. C.. is not surpris
ing. There was little hope for him and
he died as others from a similar wound.
His undoing was the result of a pistol
shot fired by J. H. Tillman: lieutenant
governor of South Carolina. From 'll
accounts the crime was cold blooded.
In the plain interpretation of law it was
deliberate murder. Tillman has at
tempted to justify himself on the plea
that he had received a threat. When
Tillman met Gonzales he was ready for
the fatal encounter. He had armed
himself with two pistols. His intent,
therefore, in carrying about him con
cealed two deadly weapons was plain.
In refutation of Tillman's excuse for
shooting Gonzales has declared that he
had ,sent no message of any kind to
Tillman. There was no reason for send
ing any message to Tillman and this
statement made deliberately by the ed
itor who realized that his career of
usefulness was about to close forever
on this earth must be accepted. Why
should it be discredited?
About a year ago ;,Gonzales had
branded Tillmuan a liar and since then
he held Tillman in contempt. He gave
Tillmhan the lie direct from a political
rstrain in the presence of thousands
of people. Tilhman was present and he
bi ar the denunciation of the fearless
.iiorm Tillman made no reply and ae
capte the lie as a matter of fact. Per

)v "n accident; m-iifo'ne. tHe is as
ambiti'o'n as he is erratic. Ilaving
tatcd the full cup of power. his thir.st
i;< insatiable. lie is a theorist, a man
of imlnpule. In his official po-ition he
would brook no opposition and he may
think he owns the American people.
The law and customs of restraint are
irksome to him: he lacks in the ele
ments which made McKinley popular.
McKinley was a smooth politician;
Roosevelt is. a Rough Rider. He con
siders theories and discards conditions.
His appointments of negroes in the
South against the protest of the intel
ligent masses, are political blunders. He
has claimed recognition from the
South through Southern blood. but his
unwarranted attack on Jefferson Davis
must withhold from him all recognition
of the gallant men who breasted the
storms of battle for constittitional lib
erty. and his attitude towards the South
must shear him of his pretense. If he
were to show sympathy or regard for
the South he assumes that the people
of the North would think him disloyal.
His recognition of the negro is in keep
ing with his vagaries and is suggested
for political effect. His every move
ment is based on an inordinate political
ambition. He expects to secure the
nomination for the presidency through
the negro delegates from the South.
Why should he care for the white peo
ple of the South who being Democrats
can give him no political support? His
boast of ,Southern blood is a mockery.
Having become President through a na
tional calamity, it is to be hoped that he
will be retired forever from political
prominence when his term of office has
expired.

A special to the Memphis Commer
cial Appeal dated Boston. Mass.. Jan
uary 16 says: The report of City Regis
ter McGlenon. just filed, will be inter
esting reading to those who think that
the appointment of a negro lawyer as
district attorney will ruffle the people
of Boston.
The statistics of births, deaths and
marriages show that an average bf be-'
tween 30o and 40 white women in this
city marry negroes every year. There
were 31 cases of mixed marriages of
this sort in igor, and for go902, while
the record is not fully made up, there
are probably 35 recorded. Such mar
riages have not taken place in the z ack
Bay. it is true, but they go on with such
frequency among the working pepole as
to evoke no comment from their neigh
bors or the officials or clergymen who
perform the ceremony.
In five, years 30o was the average, and
in igoo there were 35.
In nearly every case it is a colored
man who marries a white woman. The
union' a white man' with a- colored
womante oabout one, a year.
The -first inarriage of the kind iin
tgIw was - on January z6, when Leon
lvpry. 'a colored teamster of 32 years,
was intaried to Julia Scott. a widow of
3p. She kept ho'kse at 27 Wheeler street
and he.bocaried- there. They. were united
by F. 0. netson,, a, .justid of the
peace, on -Boylston street.
-Next J. W. Jenkins, colbred. aged 47,
won Jennie Sioga, a widow fourteen
years ihis junior. They were a waiter
apd waitress, be irvinsg At 54 North An
dersonm street and .she at '41 Abderson
street. Tirs was also a juaptice of the
peace' wedding. ,and C. A. Fehyl per
formed it on February 55. o
On April 6 AMstonlopez of 45o

was a barber at 6 Ohio street and came
from Austin, Tex. They were-wedded
ip April by Rev. W. A. Shaw.
Victor Reynolds, colored, aged 24. of
1776 Washington street, led Annie Kel
ley, six years older than himself, house
keeper at the same house, to Rev. C.
E. Davis, 57 Rutland street. a:nd they
were married early in April. She had
been married before and divorced. "
A few "days later A. T. Cobb a shoe

Helen King, a widow of 40 Warren
street, and who was a typewritst. They
were united by E. J. Holland, justice

IMMIGRATION LEAGUE.
There is a noticeable feature in the
reports of the proceedings of the Im
migration League. organized in New
Orleans, which is the absence of the
pictures of the prominent gentlemen in
the gathering. Generally on such occa
sion:; the Picayune and the Times
D)cmocrat have vied with each other in
the picture gallery line, which. however,
may he reserved as a grand flash light
at the wind-up of the assembly. How
ever, the league has, from reports, or
ganized on practical business principles
which may secure results satisfactory in
the future. No sensible man will gain
say the fact that home-seekers and
home-makers are desired, but these do
not move by faith or promise and must
be persuaded with reasonable induce
ments. The class of people needed in
the ttates represented in the convention.
in fact in every Southern state, are not
the Mexican peons, nor the scums of
Europe. Of these there is a surplus.
The "Hub of the Universe" is howl
ing in dismay over the appointment of
Wm. H. Lewis. a colored gentleman, to
the position of United States attorney.
Why not? It was in the "Hub" that the
emancipation of slavery was originated;
in Boston. wljere the "nigger" has been
considered as good, if not a little bet
ter than, the Southern white min. Let
"Bosting' howl.

CRAWFORDS JAILED.
-- a
Father and Sn Iindicted by the (Grand
Jury for Murder.
-----*
The grand jury having indicted I)r.
G. B. Crawford and his son. C. C.
Crawford, were advised of this fact
and surrendered to Sheriff Ward Tues
day afternoon. The indictments being
murder, no bail could be received and
the father and son were jailed. The
prisoners are residents of Red River
parish. The crime for which they are
indicted was committed in the J. T.
Ilagcn saloon on Texas street opposite
the postofice on the morning of Octo
her 8. 1902. Their victim was John H.
Vickers, the harkeeper, who had been
outrageously insulted and who was un
armed. Dr. Crawford's plea at the pre
liminary examination soop after this
crime was justification in defense of his
son, who was discharged from custody
by Judge Land. and who fixed Dr.
Crawford's bond at $2ooo on which he
twas released from jail. The shooting,
or rather murder, originated over a dis
pute as to the quality of whiskey which
the prisoner had ordered for drink. The
grand jury's indictment is based on the
same testimony which was submitted at
the preliminary. The date of the trial
will be fixed when the prisoners are ar
raigned to record their plea of guilty or
not guilty as is provided by law.
