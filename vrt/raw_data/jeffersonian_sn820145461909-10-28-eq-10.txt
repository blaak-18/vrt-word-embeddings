Some Thoughts in Regard
to Missions
BY A LADY OF ARKANSAS
I had some strange thoughts the
other day while reading Miss May
Dye’s letter from Brazil. Miss May,
you know, is a missionary sent from
Texas over to Brazil to Christianize
the people there. Here is a part of
her letter:
“For over a month I have been
living with some Brazilians on a hill
right in front of the mission, within
a few minutes’ walk from the very
center of my work. The situation is
ideal. The house is so high that I
can look over the gloom and din of
the city to the most beautiful bay
and mountains in the World. From
my desk I can look out of one win
dow and see the grand mountains,
then turning to the other I get a
view of the miserable abodes of the
poor people. It is not a beautiful
sight, but I am glad it is here, for it
is a constant call to prayer that God
may fill their lives with the sunshine
of His love. I have- never been
where I had such opportunities as I
have here.”
Dear me, how strange that Miss
Dye had to travel all that distance
to find the poor, when her own be
loved State is populated with so
many poor people who live in miser
able hotels, and so many of them
have no homes at all. How strange!
If Miss Dye wanted to work for
Christ among the poor, she certainly
could have found employment at
home.
Miss May says: “You will be in
terested in my girls’ society, com
posed of seventeen girls between
thirteen and seventeen years of age.
They selected for their name ‘Work
ers for Jesus’, and fpr their motto,
‘Be content with nothing less than
perfection.’ ” (Here I stopped and
wondered how those girls, so ignor
ant of the Christian religion, could
ever have thought of this name and
motto.)
She further says: “They are near
ly all working girls, who know noth
ing of life but drudgery and dirt.” I
wonder if Miss May has never seen
any girls in her own country who
know nothing but drudgery and hard
work in the cotton-fields, in the sew
ing-rooms, bent over the washtubs,
or behind the counter of some store.
Indeed, there are many places of
drudgery occupied by the white girls
of our country who would gladly ac
cept the opportunities given those
Brazilian girls.
This ardent young missionary goes
on to say: “It is my desire that
this society shall help them physi
cally, mentally, spiritually and so
cially—physically by physical cul
ture exercises, basket-ball, etc. The
means of mental development will
be more difficult, as they have very
little ambition in this direction.”
(Such would not be the case with re
gard to the attitude of our girls to
mental development.)
Then Miss May says: “Once a
month we will have a social meeting.
We have had one already, which the
girls enjoyed very much. We played
‘Poor Kitty’, and had the potato
race, etc., while some friends made
candy for us.” Now, you white girls
who are toiling in the sweat-shops
of our country, how do you feel
Cshe 3effersonlan
about this? How many of you are
going to hand over your dollar
toward paying Miss May’s salary
while she is over there in Brazil
teaching those girls how to play bas
ket-ball, etc.? When you have time,
look it up in the Bible and inform
me where either Christ or the dis
ciples commanded us to go to foreign
countries and teach the girls such
frivolous things as basket-ball and
“Poor Kitty”. x
Continuing she says: “The hard
est thing about a missionary’s work
is to see the open doors and be un
able to enter them.” Would not our
girls enjoy the luxuries those Brazil
ian girls are having. Wouldn’t it be
nice for some friend to make candy
for them while they played about?
Wouldn’t they enjoy a vacation, a
rest from toil—just long enough,
even, to visit the poor, sick .mother
who must be supported, and the lit
tle orphan sister and brother that
must be fed in their helplessness?
The minister says we must help
send the Gospel to the heathen, and
this basket-ball, potato race and
“Poor Kitty” is what we are sending
by our hard labor.
This letter, for the consideration
of all who read it, is from a mother
who is in sympathy with the poor
people at home. L. W. G.

PLE TAKE NOTICE.
Dear Sir: —Your paper and mag
azine are doing a lot of good in this
section. They are causing people to
sit up and take notice as they haven’t
done since the Populist party ceased
to be an active factor in politics.
Your eye-opening articles on for
eign missions are causing much com
ment pro and con, but I am pleased
that most of the people are with you
on this great question.
Mr. Watson, you are the best loved,
the worst hated, the most admired,
the worst detested, have the strong
est friends and the bitterest enemies
of any man in the United states. I
can also say that you are doing more
good than any other man.
Push up the date of my subscrip
tion to the weekly Jeffersonian. I
can’t do without it.
Very respectfully,
