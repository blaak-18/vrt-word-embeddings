BLUNT IN EFFEKT.
ALMOST A BATTLE.
The Blot Saturday.
To know all the causes which led
to, and of which the disturbance of
Saturday was simply the effect, ou.
readers have to refer to the files o1
the VINDICATOR since its first issue
It is comprehended in one word
BLUNT.
Wherever a negro assumes or as
quires an unbounded influence ovel
hib tace, it is for good or bad and we
are pained to say, in most instancel
for bad.
BLUNT
had that influence and he was bad
He knew nothing but color, acn
every act of his public life was acs
tuated solely by his intense hatred to
the whites. That was the mainsprinl
of his whole pobile and private con
duct. In polities, in religion, and ii
all his social ties, 'twas the same.
HIS ABUSE OF THE WHITE MAN
was persistant and bitter. His man
ner and language violent and incen

drove from the clubs every Conserva
tire or law abidiug white person long
since; and his religious sermons wer
burdened with the expressions the

men who believed in him, Blunt
at and Christ at any time afterwards
Every intelligent white man knev
this, and knew well that
BLUNT HAD NO HESITANCY
in acting on his belief. Consequent
ly, when be announced his intentiot
to again etdr politics, which he hat
promijprs faithfully not to do, ant
-deared that that entering was but
FOR REVENGB,
every person was either uneasy o1
alarmed. The law abiding citizer
knew that the time had come for de
clairve action; that a crisis was upor
us, and that they must act promptly
AS FAR BACK AS MONDAY,
the air was full of rumors that Blomn
Breda, and others were derm
to moake a demonstratioab&er words,
oeratl Convontiorqormed the writer,
as a a - Mil to the colored people
that they Intended to ball
- white Convention
OR BURN THE TOWN.
When they gathered at the lower end
of the oity, and under the influence
of their ineediary speakers, their
hes sand yells startled to action
, iua n. Th 'Convention was
and * person won
ere
and
the
of
I
homer and those out, were at the
Cout use without arms or ap
preh na a of danger. Four young
men had been stationed on the town
end of the Dyke, which is fully a
mile from the Court House, and the
first news of this force was brought
by them. The negroes crowded for
ward about dusk to cross the Dyke,
and rescue Blunt, who had been cap
tured at his house and assured of
personal safety, and burn the town.
Our young men halted them, when
the negroes immediately opened fire
which was promptly returned. Over
fifty shots were fired, when the ne
groes, or the greater part broke and
fled. Our people then organized and
prepared to meet the danger which
was then so threatening and eminent.
Reinforcements were sent for and
every effort which prudence could
suggest was made to put down the
negro mob. Sunday was quite ex
citing, and scouting parties brought
intelligence that a number of armed
negroes were congregating about 8
miles below town. A strong force
was sent down but they scattered be
fore they had arrived by the advance
of a party of whites from below.
THE C.ASUALTIES
we are greatful are not serious. As
far as we can learn, but five negroes
were wounded. None dangerously.
Of the whites, but two were slightly
wounded.
ARRESTS
were made of all the instigators of
these riotous proceedings, and the
leaders were ordered out of the par
ish, not to return. Our safety de.
manded this, for every one of these
fellows was a public enemy whose
presence here was a constant danger
to the peace and welfare of the cem
munity.
AT PRESENT
all is quiet, the negroes ate at home,
d assured they will not be disturbed as
)f long as they attend to their business
ir -nay, that they will be protected in
f their lives, property and welfare, sc
e long as they do so.
a TIIE INSTIGATORS
will be summarily dealt with, as a
warning to all future disturbers of
er the peace, and we hope the lessor
e will be salutary and effective.

..t all who favor rigid quarantint
are either cowards or speculatorm
Trlis is a very broad and sweepini,
charge, not reconciled to thle facts of
. tile case, andl so utterly ountside the
, pale of oflicial manners and gentility,
which generally is not of a very high
Sorder, that it is not deserving of other
reply than to say that the charge
of "speculation" can as well be made
form the stand-point of the quaran
ltiners as from the non-quarantiners.
Onr people, if we know them and we
think we do, will read the resolutions,
which we append, and treat them
with contempt, and that is about all
they deserve. We beg to add how.
ever that the people of Grant parish
and their police jury don't agree at
all, for they favor the quarantine.
We would recommend, as the police
jury has presumed to place nus in tu
telage, that the members cultivate,
on the quarantine question at least,
a knowledge of the subject and
genteel mannergn dealing with it.
SProceedings of the Police Jury of the
.Parish of Grant.
COLFAX, La., Sept. 16, 1878.
In compliance with a petition ad
dressed to the Presidet of the Police
Jury, signed by twelve citizens, free
holders of the the parish of GrQnt, the
Presidcnt called a meeting of the
Police Jury, for the purposeo ofcon
sidering the question of qua ntine.

Messers. M. N. Swafford, C. W. Fittz,
F. L. Craig, J. W. Tison and Mat
thew Nugent, Jr.
Mr. Fittz presented the following
resolution, which was adopted.
WHEREAS, the yellow fever panic
has driven our siste, parishes beyond
the verge of reason on the quarantine
question; and
WHBEREAS, their Police Juries and
other parochial authorities have gone
into extremes to enforce what they
call a quarantine law, shutting them
selves up in theirown parishes and
ly spending the mon~y they
e of,.ad, instead oeen
