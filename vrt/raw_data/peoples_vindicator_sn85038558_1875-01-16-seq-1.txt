lhon. W. W. Phelps, , \\:shington, P. C.: tnte
S.r-I find il this inorniug's edition taill
of thePica!nne, of this eity, a state- btIns
llent made by yourself to the corres- ther
poldent of the New Yerk Tribune, Cons
that you are of opinion that the or- ,HCIn
ganization of the House of Represen- Inan
tatives of this State, effelctd on the ar io
4th inst. by the Conservatives, is il
legal, because of the participation of " ie
the five members elected from par- Set
ishes not canvassed by tlhe Return- cond
ing Itlrtd, but referred to the res
pective houses of the General Asseni- Kell
blv for decision. In support of this
positilo you rely upon tihe following
paragraph from the 4t1 section of the T
statute of this State creating the Re- To 1
turning Board, passed in 1672, which
is in these words : "That Represen
tatives whose unaacs are on this roll,
and they only, shall take part in the
organization of the House."
it seems that you consider the gist edge
q of the whole question as to legality rwit
of the action of the Conservatives in ferit
organizing the Wiltz House of Itepre- ditil
sentatives to depend upon whether lea
mnetlers elected from the fonr refer- the
red parishes had a right to take part rF
in the organization, they not havipg an i
been returned by the board. s t
My impression is that you have fil- and
len into an error, hy not taking into entl
consideration the fact that the return you
of the members fromt those parishes the
was not made by the board ot can- tile
vassers but referred to the .Legisla- not
.ture. The effect of the omission or re- you
fRusal of.the I,hurd to ,lelaIte who were
elected to the HIouse of lRepresent:'1- ig
tives front the parishes just referred
to, wats, in my judgment, to relieve fur
thenm from the tegai effect of an ad- we
verse return of the board, and that lial
the House was competent to decide cid
for itself, even in the preliminary or- ern
ganization, who were elected from ass
those parishes. I beg leave to call
your attention to Art. 34 of the Con
stitution of the State, which says, col
"Each House of the General Assetn- ele
hl., is the judge of the qualifications, o
election and returns of its members," e
- etc. This duty was imperative, and el
was rightfully performed during the
temporary organmization, and irnme- co
diately .fter the roll or list of the re- ei
turned nemebers, had been- called by to
1 the clerk, because the representatives g
Ott fron the four parishes referred to it el
by the Board, whoever they were,
had the right to participate in the i
*permanent organization. ed
The thirty-third article of the Con- cls
stitution provides "that not less than rig
a majority of the nmeerubes of each be
house of the General Asusembly shall
form a quorum to transact business ; or
but a smaller number may adjourn m
ifrotm day to day, and shall have full Ml
power to compel attendanco of ab ct
sent members." A minority, there
fore, has the power to pass .apon the
election and retnrn of their eoleagues
who are bro ght into the H[ouse in l
pursuance to this article of the Con
stitution.
The relative strength of parties in
the House on the 4th inst., at the
time of the organization after the five
members were received from the re
Sferred parishes, was so close as to "
give the Coiservatives the olajority.
'rte election returns from tile parish t
of Bierinville without oplposition; I
Lg maintain, however, that that part of C
the statute of 1872, to which you re- e
La er', is unconstittiional, hea.use itt
takes from the respective houses of
tile General Assembly the right to e
pass upon the election and returns of
its memubers, for all purposes and at
all stages of their proceedings, which
1 al is conferred by the organtlic law with- i
b. out exception or litiitation. Such is
. the constitntionual provision on this a
sntbject, but thile statute in effect says
Sthat the Houses shaill only exercise
that right after the orgaization is
perfected, but that the Returning
Board shall have the power of de
Sterniniing the status of those menm
bers who alone shall have the right
to take part in thile organization. If
the right to judge of the electionsand
. returns of its own members in this
State has been taken away from the
Hotnse of Representatives until after
the organization, the effect of the sta
tute is to put it in the power of an.
uscmpunlous Returning Board to
change the political complexion of
the body and defeat 'the will of the
Speople. To lflustrate ::" Sppose in a
House of one hundred members the
Democrats,. or Republicans, as the case
might bb, had elected sixty members
and their adversaries forty, but the
Returning Beard retnrned as elected
all the minority agand bt twentyfi8ve
A. of the majority, those added would
- constitute a quornm; and if tilhe others
c not returned, but referred, hays no
cs. authorjty to take part in the organ
ization, it would be in the power of
the forty to unseat as many of thliir
adversaries as they choose and flll
Stheirplaceqa with their friends. And
I may add that this is precisely what
an overwhelming mljotity of the most
Sintelligent people in this State be
lieve to have been attempted in this
SState by the joint action of the Re
trt, turhing Board and the Republican
members returned by it as elected to
,the House of Representatives of this
State,
