PAGE TWO
MANUSCRIPT came into
my possession some time
ago, and the propriety or
impropriety of publishing
it has caused me a deal of
perplexing speculation;
not there is anything in
lit to corrupt even a
I thoughtless reader, but
for the reason that some of its de
tails are shocking. However, I have
overcome every scruple against its
publication, and now give it over to
the promulgation of the printer:
Every one who knew me during my
earlier life must 'have regarded me as
a truthful main. My name is Robert
Wexford and I was born in a little
town in Southern Missouri, long be
fore Chicago had become a great and
—I sometimes fancy —an aching nerve
center. I was not bright as a boy,
and, growing up too rapidly, my
father said, was rather a dull young
man. The girls who visited my sister
were disposed to make sport of me,
and when they were gone, after poking
fun at me, I used to go angrily to my
room and curse myself. Indeed, I
was so far from being sharp that I
was known in the town as Blunt Wex
ford. I left the town and began
clerking in a dry-goods store in
Southern Illinois, and, although I was
dull, I succeeded, for, having no in
tellectual quality to build a hope on,
I depended wholly upon my industry.
From time -to time I was advanced,
until I occupied a position of trust.
Finally the firm moved to Chicago,
and, five years later, I was a member
of the company. Although I was
prosperous and in a fairway to be
come rich, I was not contented with
myself, for I was still dull in conver
sation, and no one cared to cultivate
me. I read a great deal, but it didn’t
seem to do me any good, for when
ever I attempted to impart any infor
mation which I might be possessed of,
I spluttered and then gave up in em
barrassment. I boarded at a private
house and with an intelligent family,
but, despite daily association, I could
never feel free -to say anything,
through fear of breaking’ down. By
some means, I hardly know how, 1
got acquainted with a young woman
named Amy Berry. The first time I
really felt an interest in her was one
evening when, bolder than usual, I at
tempted to tell a humorous story—
surely a delicate undertaking even for
bright men. I failed, but Miss Berry
did not laugh when I forgot the point
of the story and began awkwardly to
flounder about in search of it, neither
did she show that sympathy which is
almost as crushing and far more
humiliating in its effect than ridicule.
In fact, I dpn’t exactly know what
she did, but I know that afterward I
had a warm regard for her. She was
a beautiful girl, and I heard a smart
man say that she was charming in
conversation. She came to the house
quite frequently, and the first thing
I knew I was in love with her. This
was a desperate situation: <a dull man
in love with a spirited talker; and I
tried to drive all thoughts of her out
of my head and, of course, failed. In
THE HOAD TO THE MIRE
many things men may control their
minds, but I don’t think any man has
ever succeeded in driving away the
image of a beautiful woman. I don’t
know that I had hopes of winning
her, and yet I constantly tortured
myself by seeking her society, al
though I could say nothing to interest
her.
One day I was suddenly taken with
inflammatory rheumatism. The pain
was so severe that the doctor gave me
a dose of morphine. The effect was
delightful; my mind became strangely
clear, and thoughts sharp-cut and fan
cies neatly trimmed flew through my
brain. The rheumatism soon passed
away, and I had no further need of
the drug, but I could not forget its
entrancing effect. An idea of con
quest occurred to me. I would take a
dose and call on Miss Berry. I did
so. So soon as I entered the room,
the young lady pleasantly remarked
that she had never seen me looking
so well.
£ 1 And you have never seen me feel
ing so well,” I answered, seating my
self and contemplating my own ease
of manner.
“I don’t know how well it is your
custom to feel,” said she, “but I do
know that I have never before seen
you appear so well.”
“And it was 'because you have never
until this moment seen my real self.
I have been hampered by mind-dark
ening embarrassments, and a tongue
too cowardly to assert itself. In
fact, I have been a fool.”
“Oh, no,” she laughed, “not a
fool, but a sufferer from lack of
confidence in self.”
“But,” I interposed, “who but the
fool is given to such suffering? It is
well enough, and doubtless commend
able, for every man to place a modest
estimate upon himself, but it is cow
ardly to stand in fear of himself. I
am pleased to say that I have broken
away from a foolish slavery.”
“I can hardly understand you,”
she said. “I can see that a great
change has come over you, but I can’t
determine its cause. It is wonder
ful!”
“Any change from my former con
dition would be wonderful, and no
change could fail to ’bring a certain
sort, of pleasure.”
She sat continuing to look at me
in astonishment. I asked her if she
had not been out of town, and she
answered that she had just returned
from a visit to the country. The
month was June, and she spoke of
the charm of the woods.
i 1 The man who loves not the woods
would seek to crucify a god,” I re
plied. “Poetry and soul do not de
mand that we shall live there, but
they do enforce a reverence and a
love for the grandeur of a tree and
the beauty of a- flower that seems to
have stolen away from the gaze of
the vulgar. The city roars a groan,
but the leaves sweetly murmur; we
chase a dollar along the sidewalk, but
in the deep heaven of the woods we
feel the presence of God.”
“But you must remember,” she
rejoined, “that sometimes there are
thieves in the woods, not chasing a
Gl)* 3«ffcrsontan

dollar, but burying it.”
“True, but they are made better
by going into the woods. There is
more religion in a bird’s nest, in a
shade sanctified by pure air, than
there is in a thousand churches; there
is more of the praise of God in the
song of one bird than there is in a
million human hallelujahs.”
We continued to talk uritil the
clock struck eleven, and when I arose
to go she said:
“Do please sit down. Let the
clock strike; let time pass. I was
never so entertained, and I am afraid
that I might never find you in so fine
a frame of mind again.”
I assured her that I had mastered
myself, and I felt that I had, and
bade her good night.
My dreams were pleasant, but when
I awoke at morning I had a dull
headache. I thought -with a thrill of
the night before, but then, and with
a shudder, too, I felt that I had lost
the intellectual mastery of myself;
anl if there were any uncertainty on
this point, it was settled soon after
I went down-stairs, for at breakfast
I attempted to say something pleasant
and ashamedly failed. I felt de
pressed, almost crushed during the
day, and, just before going home,
took more morphine. Miss Berry
dined with us that evening, and while
I was walking home with he’*, she
said:
“I am glad to see that you are
still master of yourself, and how for
tunate it is, for you are too well read
a man to be hampered by any sort
of embarrassment.”
I repeated my former declaration,
that I should never be in slavery
again, and then flew off into a whirl
of panegyrics on the beauty of the
night.
“Oh, how thrilling with surprises
you are,” she said, when we arrived
at her father’s door. “I have never
seen any one who so perfectly un
derstands the art of holding interest.
You know that to hold a woman’s
interest you must keep your plot con
certed, as it were. You must con
stantly surprise her. Won’t you
come in?”
“I fear that it is too late.”
“Oh, I didn’t think of that. Some
how I can’t keep track of time when
I am with you.”
Then I caught her hand and told
her of my love. At first she at
tempted to stop me, but I poured out
my words in a wild flood, and, yield
ing, she suffered me to press her to
my bosom. I fancied that I walked
up among the stars when I went home
that night, but after I went to bed, a
fear found its way into my bosom
and lay cold upon my heart —a fear
that I should have #o take more mor
phine. I was wretched the next day,
and I yielded. Then I said I would
take the drug for one day more and
stop, no matter if I should be dull
and miserable. I did quit the next
day, and found that after all it was
not so hard a task. Three days
passed, and I was free from the in
fluence of morphia, but my rheuma
tism returned, and I began taking the
drug again. I quit again so soon as
I recovered, and I swore that I never
would touch it again, and yet I knew
that I should not be able to entertain
Miss Berry.
On evening when I had an engage
ment to take her to a theater, I felt
that I should lose her if I appeared
in my natural state of dullness, and
—well, I took morphine. We spent
a delightful evening, and when I re
turned home, I decided to take the
drug until we were married, and then
throw it away forever. The months
passed with elysian I
could not believe that any other man
had ever been so happy. The wed
ding day approached. It came, and
I saw my beautiful bride receiving
the congratulations of her friends.
I bought a pleasantly situated
house and moved into it. During the
excitement I had forgotten the prom
ise which I had made to myself, but
I thought of it about the time we
were well settled. Then it came
upon me, and I shuddered, but I re
solved to keep it.
The resolve went into effect one
morning when we had been keeping
house two weeks. I well remember
the morning. My wife was joyous,
and talked at breakfast of the many
things she intended to do. She was
going that day to buy some very old
books that she knew I would like. I
did not feel so very bad at first, but I
was miserable by the time I reached
the store. If ten thousand devils
had been urging me to take morphine
I could not have been more harassed.
Sometimes I felt as if insects with
prickly legs were crawling all over
me under the skin, and I could find
no rest. I went out for a walk. The
sun was shining, and yet to me the
day was dark. I was constantly
afraid of being run over, and if I
saw a. team far up the street I would
wait until it passed before I dared to
cross over. My head ached, and at
times ice-water seemed to be surging
through my veins. Freezing places
shifted about on me —sometimes my
feet and then my back. Once I
thought that my scalp was frost-bit
ten, and suddenly it occurred to me
that my hair had turned white, and
I went into a bafiber-slhop and looked
at myself. While standing on a cor
ner, afraid to cross, I felt that I was
about to die, and I wondered how
long it would be before I should drop
dead. I went home in agony—not
sharp pains, but a dead, cold lifeless
ness, worse than the keenest misery.
“What on earth is the matter,
dear?” my wife asked.
“Nothing, only I don’t feel well;
it will soon pass off.”
“Let me send for a doctor.”
“No, I’ll soon be all right.”
I went to bed and tossed all night.
The next morning it seemed that my
trouble had just begun.
“You are too ill to go down town,”
my wife declared.
“Oh, no, I must go. I’d die if I
didn’t —I mean that I have some
very urgent business that must be at
tended to.”
“You must not go.”
“I must—l will.”
That evening when I returned
