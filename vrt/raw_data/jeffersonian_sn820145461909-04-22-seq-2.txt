The One With the “Red < Brohm Hair
By 'Richard Washburn Child,
HE story of Elaine Quinn
was told in the tea room
of the Red Hotel on the
Avenue late one winter
afternoon. The architect
thought it unpleasant and
a f terwards commented
upon the listless way in
which MTs. Colvin-Ever-
hard placed it before us. The other
man was a lawyer and a professional
cynic and yet he believed the story
and it awoke something new in him
that put fire in his eyes for a moment
and made him clench the hand that
held the cigarette. Miss Gaylord, the
second woman, saw that he was mom
entarily stirred for some other than
a selfish reason and she afterward
said that it furnished her the real
reason for marring him. But of course
Elaine Quinn will never know it. She
will never even know that the lawyer
believes the story about her is all true.
She, on one hand, and Mrs. Everhard
and Miss Gaylord, who married the law
yer, on the other, were totally different
kinds of women. This Elaine, so Mrs.
Everhard said, began by being a rather
awkward country girl. She would have
furnished an extraordinary contrast to
these smart women with their penciled
eyebrows.
When she was eighteen and her mo
ther had taken all that remained of
the money to be buried, Elaine found
herself, as the neighbors said, ‘ ‘ all out
of folks.” She had to seek great op
portunities : she had to go to New York,
where there was plenty of employment
for women.
Elaine went. May we suppose that
two or three second cousins and a
feeble-minded old grand aunt came
down to the station to say good-by to
her? They saw that her cheap trunk,
bought at the Emporium, was put on
the train, they noted the flush of youth
in her cheeks. Indeed she was so
healthly and strong and pretty! She
kissed them all. They were relieved
that she was going to shift for her
self. 4 4 Good-by, Elie. Good-by! ’ ’ None
of them would have believed that her
career would be what it turned out tc
be. “Bea good girl,” said the feeble
minded old aunt, sniffling. And so the
puffing tram left the junction station
and started onward toward the city.
Some would think Elaine Quinn’s
story was a very conventional story
indeed. Others think it very astonish
ing and shocking. It all depends on
the listener. Except for the fact that
she was so perfect a specimen of young
girl and wore about her, like invisible
mantles, so much simple truth and
modesty, she was a good deal the reg
ular country girls who come down to
the city from the story books. And
her entry into New York was like the
others.
It was the same uninteresting story
of finding a furnished room and then
counting the fifty-seven saved dollars
to be sure they had not vanished by
some of the dangerous magic of the
city, about which the uninitiated 4 ‘up
state” have such vague ideas. Elaine
did not know how little money this
really was.
She knew no one in New York except
a girl named Paula Van Reuter
who had been a waitress at the Pine
Knoll summer hotel—and she had lost
the address. There was nothing to do
that evening or all day Sunday unless
she sat down to cry. But Elaine was
not of the tearful sort and so she went
about the task of trying to make her
dingy room look homelike. She had
photographs of four girl friends in
her cheap trunk, and she rearranged
them on the walls an unblievable num
ber of times. There was one picture
already hanging above the head of the
bed—an ideal photographic study of
Priscilla at a spinning wheel, with an
elaborate gilt frame that unmistakably
would have suggested to some of us
either trading stamps or five-and-ten
cent stores. To Elaine it was pretty.
And besides she had a picture of her
own, framed in passe-partout style —a
delineation of a young woman and a
young man sitting close together on a
moonlit beach, gazing off across a pen
and-ink ocean. It would have been
hard for Elaine to explain why she
bought this picture of a peddler
a year before. She merely realized
that there was a subtle suggestion
of almost unbelievable happiness in
the picture. That was all. No
such young man had ever sat with her
gazing out across the sea. In fact no
young man —The picture was a beauti
ful mystery. She hung it over the
gas jet.
She went on re arranging things—
the fancy quilt her mother had made
and the pictures and the two books
on the table, and she went down to
the clattering restaurant in the base
ment next door for her three meals,
so that it was not until Sunday, as
dusk was falling and the lights on the
street below poked out foggily through
the mist-laden air, that the first touch
of the urban drunkenness came upon
her. She realized, with a little audi
ble gasp, that she was without re
sponsibility.
No one was anywhere about to ques
tion her. She was free! She could
go forth, as she had not yet done, to
sway through the thoroughfares with
the flow of the rest of the hordes of
unknown, unrecognized and terribly
free pedestrians. She might make
faces at people who went by on the
back platforms of cars and they would
never see her again. She might stay
out until any time and no one would
ever whisper about her. She had now
become her own government, and in
her power to direct herself she had
endless and simple faith. Now she
could see, hear, smell and touch what
she chose, and every nerve in her body
sang of freedom. Who could say nay ?
Tomorrow she would find employ
ment. The landlady, who apparently
was a person eternally cooking cauli
flower in the dark kitchen down-stairs,
had said there was only one thing an
untrained girl could do —work In a
department store.
“Will ye keep the room you’ve got
or take the little one onto the top
floor?” she asked, being familiar with
the situation.
Elaine laughed wholesomely and
ignorantly. She assured the stout
keeper of the furnished-room house
that she had just “got fixed” and she
would not move for some time.
“Oh, well, it’s none of my busi
ness,” said the other. “You know
your own affairs.” But when Elaine
3fcffersonlan
started out in pursuit of work on Mon
day morning, she took another search
ing look at her from behind the
starchy lace curtains of the parlor
room.
It goes on being a commonplace
story in away. For Elaine could not
find work on Monday. One said that
only skilled saleswomen were em
ployed; another promised a place
when the holiday season was on. An
employment agent of a store on Sixth
avenue asked her if she lived at home.
“No?” He was a little pudgy man
with grotesquely fat fingers. “Have
an income of your own?” Elaine al
most laughed. The little beady eyes
shone an honest, kindly light suddenly
as he said: ‘ 1 Why not go back —away
from New York altogether?” She
remembered, several years later, how
he had dismissed her, and then she un
derstood him better.
Tuesday it was the same. In the
afternoon she was tempted beyond re
sistance by the phonograph in front of
a moving picture show. She went in
and the time flew by. A week later
she had a brave record of the places
she had visited. It was written on the
bottom of her box of stationery,
though she might as well have used a
sheet of paper itself inasmuch as she
had no one to whom she could write.
By this time the freedom of herself
had become a strangely fearful thing
—a thing of unknown terrors. She
was even innocent of any knowledge
of the fear itself. She only knew that
up and down, up and down went the
emotions and the pictures before the
mind —the joy of irresponsibility and
then the horror of it and of loneliness,
the picture of a gorgeous drama and
pageant, the picture of a hopeless
swirl of nameless humanity. The
money had shrunk to forty-two dollars
and some change. It was easy .to see
the end of it.
A very, very wise person would
have gone back to Pinetop village.
Elaine was eighteen and not among
the very wise persons. She was not
even a sociologist. She found that
she could get several places in stores
which would pay her four or five dol
lars a week, but she had assumed that
this amount, no doubt enough in Pine
top, would not keep her alone in New
York. Her room cost two dollars and
seventy-five cents and her meals a
little more than that. Perhaps other
girls could manage better. Think of
the number of them whom she had
seen behind the rows and rows of
counters! She looked at her money
again and found there was twenty
four dollars and a five-eent piece. She
needed a new pair of shoes.
New York was lonely in spite of all
its liberty. Some how there was a
suspicion that liberty meant slavery.
She rearranged the photographs of the
four homely girl friends. The red
striped wall paper had become tire
some now; it had been exciting at first.
Elaine thought of the feeble-minded
old grand aunt back home and laughed
at the idea that she wanted to cry.
The cars clanged along down at the
corner. She looked at herself in the
mirror. And then she glanced up at
the girl in the pen-and-ink drawing,
and in a moment more, awaking sud
denly, she realized that it was now
time to go out again to look for a
place.
She tried Deering & Co. —that tre
mendous emporium! They had adver
tised in the paper in the want column,
and the size of type they used, in con
trast to the other advertisements, sug
gested their dire need of employees.
Elaine had to look in a telephone book
to see where the store was, because,
although she had been there once, it
had now become lost in the mighty
nightmare of store memories.
This was a wonderful day of clear
cold sunlight. Her eyes shone with
vitality as she walked along the street;
her cheeks were red with the wind,
her step was as full of innocent
strength as the step of Diana.
Mrs. Colvin-Everhard, going on with
her story, said that Elaine had to see
an assistant employment agent at so
large an establishment. Apparently the
employment agent merely was under
a duty to employ employment agents
and to draw up charts with curves and
diagrams to show the wages paid by
departments and the relation of these
figures to the sales and the compara
tive efficiency of men and women per
unit of cost per hour and other things
of the sort which business men call
“system.”
It was the assistant employment
agent, therefore, who looked at Elaine
with frank admiration. His eye de
tected no powder or other beautifiers;
his nose caught no whiff of perfumery.
He was an intensely selfish young man
who improved his mind and body every
evening at a Young Man’s Christian
Something and had absurdly sloping
shoulders, fifteen-inch biceps, com
pletely muscle-'bound, watery blue
eyes and a pale yellow round of hair
outside of a pink bald spot. He was
a selfish, model young man, but he was
discriminating. He liked Elaine be
cause her beauty was honest. He of
fered her a “position.”
He had spoken to other applicants
of “jobs,” but the higher-sounding
word seemed more fitting when con
nected with an actual opening.
Now he rapped with his pencil on
his teeth and said, “I think I will put
you on work at the notion counter.”
“Excuse me,” said Elaine with her
pretty mouth, “what will 1 get
week?”
He put his long, bony forefinger
upon a printed sheet which lay before
him on his desk and with it foun 1 a
figure. He tapped on this figure as
if to emphasize the fact that some
immutable determination had fixed it
there forever.
“Five,” said he.
Elaine’s blue eyes sought his. “I
am new here,” she said. “It doesn’t
seem as if I could get along—l mean,
live—on that. You know better than
I do about what the girls without
homes have to have here. Can I live
on five?”
Fate played a trick then. For it
was a part of Carleton D. Deering’s
personal < 4 system” to be at the store
for two hours every morning and with
a swift but regal step walk
about, visiting the departments.
And now here he was. He had made
a sudden appearance, standing at the
shoulder of this young man, who did
