OUR WAHINGTON LEfTTER.
WASHINGTos D. C., July 6, 1878.
Mr. Hayes with the concurrence of
his Cabinet, yesterday decided not to
use all the money appryp4.
Congress for certain purpoead4r8
them being river and harbor improve- sa
ments and the erection of public
buildings. In this he follows an ex
ample set by President Grant. Des
pite the outrageous sums voted for
river and harbor improvetents, fa
much of which will be wasted, it is a
serious question whether Mr. Irayes
will do it is an interference with the tl
will of the people expressed in the to
usual manner, and which it is his
sworn Constitutional duty to obey ai
and if he expends all that is appro- m
priated to one section oi' pic0 , and
neglects to do so in another,- he will
be sure to provoke just opposition. ts
Between a desire-let us hope an
honest desire-to save several mil
lions of dollars from waste, and the cl
danger always incured in refusing to ii
execute the law, Mr. Hayes' position
is a disagreeable one. However, as
his office was stolen and he is the hr
most unpopular of all who have tilled T
the place of President, he may be
lieve that a little disregard of law in
will not put him in new danger or h,
add to his unpopularity. ';~F ' p
The proceedings of theIlaes.a "
tion Committee canntot be said tq. be
very interesting at tins time 'That C
remarkable woman, 'Mrs. Jenks, at
ter bulldozing Ben Butler and the rI
other members of the Committee
she frightened them all, but it was e
more noticeable in Butler, who has a
not been thoroughly scared since he ii
left the Army-finished her testimony
and moved an adjournment of thel
Committee. Ex-Marshal Pitkin, of e
Louisiana, testified, and William E. h
Chandler is now on the stand. The t
latter explained some of his cipher
telegrams while in Florida, to the t
Private Secretary of Hayes and other 1
persons. One of them called for five i
thousand dollars to be expended in
Florida, which money ,Chandler says
was sent him. Unfortunately but
few of the telegrams can be found.
There has been the same lack tf oi'
ginal documents ever since the iii
vestigation commenced. It is thoulght, i
though, that many are in possession
of the Committee.
The everlasting quarrel. Ami.ong
Maryland Republicans about the Fed
eral officers in that State is just now
raging furiously. Thie parties to it
live so near to Washington that, in
stead of writing letters,; which coylf
be pigeon haled, they eoti&o dveI ih
delegations or swarms, Or armies tabnt
personally annoy those who have
patronage to dispense or influenc in
its distribution. From the 4th of
March 1877, until the Baltimore of
fleces were filled, one or two Maryland
Delegations were daily at the White
House.
Governor Hendricks spent a few
days here lately, and met many old
Washington friends. He has a great
deal of personal popularity in this
District, as he deserves.
That seem to be a profitless quar
rel between Mr. Hewitt and Mr. War
terson over the Electoral Commission
Bill. One interesting question, which
ought to be answered fully is left in
doubt. Mr. Watterseo says that Gov.
Tilden was opposed to the bill, Mr.
Hewitt says that he discussed the bill
for hours with Mr. Tilden, and as the
result of the conversation was con
vinced that if one or two minor
amendments could be made which
were afterwards made, the Governor
would favor the bill.
Have we a Constitution p
[N. O. Democrat.] ci
Has the State of Louisiana a con- ti
stitution I This is ý momentous p
question, and ounylitllh.ib desire to
propound to the anti.conveutiouist. tl
Constitutions have their birth in the
will of the people, and exist by their
mere sufferance. That thie present r
exists by sufferance only, none can a
deny; and the Democratic party of c
this State stands on recod- as deny- II
ing the validity of the constitution of a
1868 and protesting by all things holy r
and sacred against the doctrines it
embodies, against the manner in e
which it was framed, and against the d
methods by which it was thrust upon c
the State. At the time of its promul- i,
gation the Democratic party denied a
that it was made by the people or for Q
the people, and it they would be con
sistent they copnot allow it to. remain
in force, or by amending it acknowl.
edge its binding force. oIn proof of
the fact that this constitutlbn was not t
adopted by the people we have only t
to refer to the ordinance submitting (
it for approval. This provides that t
It "shall be submitted for. ratification f
to the registered voters of the State
in conformity to the act of Congress"
known as the reconstruction act, un.
der which nearly all the intelligence a
and virtue of the State was disfran. t
chised, !ee prg ba e.ied
under the reconstractioiin ai stf on
grte shall vote; s5li noe others."
This is the language of the ordinance
submitting this instrument for ratifi
cation. Who were the persons qual
ified under those acts t Answer this
question and then they say if this in
strument was called into existence by
the will of the people of Louisiana-
if by them it ras made the fundemen
tal law 1
Let as take one articleof this. oen i
stitutipn oilp, l a4sk kkf it is the
will oftht~jpesleo df·fis'ate. Ar
tiele 99 disfranchieed ,thlte-fourths of
those whom the Democratic party
maintains are the true people of this
State.
"Those who held office, civil or
military, for oneyearm more, under
the organization styled 'The Con
federated States of America;' those
who registered themselves as enemies
of the United Statgs; tiog wh o acted
as leaders of guerilsa bands dadr.lmg
the late rebellion 4. shemn ho ip,. the
advocacy of treason, wrote or pub
published ger.peo art~les or
preahed sertons o e og t h ate re
bellion; and those who voted for and
signed an ordinance of secession in
any State," are amt g4he person dis
franchised by this so-called constitu
tion. Can any honest man say that
this wacas exprmeaoof the will of
the people of Louýaiap I tan any
cnasistent mao; dIfy'diti n with
a modicum of self.respect, allow a
constitution in whiuk this clause was
embodied to remain the fundamental

Democracy and Radicalism
[New York Day Book.] D
If politicals parties. have any signifi
cace,. and.are entitled to popular res
pect, it ought to be because of the prin
ciples they uphold and represent, and the
general policy they adhere to and prac
tice. There are two distinctive great g
party organizations - the Democratic and E
the Radical. In foundation principle
they are as different as day and night, as
light atnd darkness, and as wide apart in a
policy as the poles. They are not as the
electric poles, positive and negative, but
rather like opposing elements, as warring ,
and irreconcilable natural forces. They
i can no more fuse and harmoniously com
bine than water and tire, than oil
f and acid. They are mutually hostile,
repellant, implacable, towards each other.
When one is upon one side the other
must be on the contrary side, and which
ever is on the top the other must be nn
e der. Until Christianity and Atheism
n can become as one, Democracy and Rad
iealism must continue as two, and the
I art of man is powerless to heal the breach
r or bridge the gulf which separates them. J
Democracy believes in a system of gov
ernment in which the people delegate
only certain stipulated powers .to the
rulers of their own selection, to be ad
mitistered alike to all, and they reserve
t to themselves whatever right and liber
y ties they do not surrender to the General
g Govetnment; while Radicalism maintains
4 the theory that the creature is superior
i to the creator, and that the States have I
Snorights.which the "National" Govern
ment may. not ignore or invade at its
pleasure. in brief, Democracy holds to
the belief that the people are sovereign,
e and the Radical theory is that sovereign
-ty rests explosively in the Government.
