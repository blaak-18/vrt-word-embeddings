“BLOODY WILLIAMSON” A MYTH
token of their admiration, and not in
his old car, which was known to law
violators in Southern Illinois as the
“Old gun boat.” This car was riddled
with bullets, but its driver was unin
jured.
The attempt to “get” Young was
given added zest last week when
members of the “Flaming Circle” im
ported a half dozen members of the
“Eagan’s Rats” gang from St. Louis,
armed them and made up a “jack pot”
of $5,000 cash, to be given to the man
who “bumps him off.”
Upon the arrival of Young and his
party in Herrin, hurried, but com
prehensive investigation revealed the
identity of many of the gangsters in
the groups that killed Constable Ca
gle and captured the Chief of Police
and his assistant.
Warrants charging murder were
sworn out against the following:
“MAJ.” ANDERSON Erstwhile
mayor of Herrin, against whom evi
dence is being secured connecting him
directly with the lawlessness that has
made this city a by-word throughout
the country.
GEORGE GALLIGAN Sheriff of
Marion county, reputed leader of the
lawless element in the county, * and
against whom Law Enforcer Young
will seek indictments from the Fed
eral Grafnd Jury for accepting bribes
in connection with liquor cases.
JOHN LAYMAN Chief deputy,
and “brains” of the “Flaming Circle”
gang, associate of bootleggers and
resort keepers.
HUGH WlLLlS—Committeeman of
the United Mine Workers of Ameri
ca, “bad man.”
ALVIN THOMAS—Deputy sheriff,
reputed bootlegegr, asociate of gam
blers.
ELL TROUTT—Mine guard, re
puted bootlegger, some time mine
guard, and admitted “hard guy.”
ORA THOMAS—Head of the in
famous “Flaming Circle,” deputy
sheriff, owner of saloon and gambling
hall, under SIO,OOO bond for liquor
selling, sponsor of the “Eagan’s
Rats.”
HEZZIE BURNS —Deputy sheriff,
under charges of bribery, associate
of Berger, proprietor of the “Half

WILLIAM RUFF Miner, reputed
member of the “Flaming Circle.”
CARL RUFF Brother of the
above, miner, and proud of his family
name.
JOHNNY MURRAY —Part owner
of the notorious Carterville pike
Roadhouse and bootlegging joint.
HARRY MURRY Brother and
business partner of the above.
Gangsters Resist Arrest
The true story of the arrest of
these men has never yet been told.
Press accounts differ in all essential
details and the facts in connection
with the battle waged by the des
perado fortififed in the city hospital
against officers armed with warrants
for their arrest is disclosed for the
first time.
After the murder of Constable
Cagle and the capture of the Chief
of Police and his assistant the
“Flaming Circle” gangsters divided.
One group under the leadership of
Sheriff Galligan left the city in au
tomobiles with their prisoners, pre
sumably* to murder them upon some
lonely highway. The other group,
under the leadership of the wounded
Chief Deputy Layman, repaired to
the city hospital three blocks distant
from the scene of the murder.
Here they closed the and
windows, examined their arms and
prepared to resist the inevitable ef
fort to place them under arrest.
Law Enforcer Young with his
aides, repaired to the hospital upon
learning that the Layman gang was
fortified there. Approaching the en
trance to the two-story brick build
ing, the officers knocked upon the
closed and locked doors, demanding
admittance in the name of the law.
The answer' to the demand was a
volley of rifle and revolver shots,
fired through the closed doors into
group of citizen officers. Miraculous
ly no one was killed. Unable to force
an entrance and not wishing to en
danger of patients and at
tendants within the hospital, Young
and his aides withdrew. As they
crossed the street the desperadoes
within the hospital opened fire upon
a party from the second-story win
lows. Under Young’s orders, mem
bers of his party shot out the street
lights that made them all vivid tar
gets for the snipers. They also fired
at the men who exposed themselves
in the windows, but could not conduct
a general attack because of the dan
ger to hospital patients.
Withdrawing from the scene, the
citizen officers notified the military
authorities of the situation and the
commanding officer detailed a com
pany to take the men into custody.
The desperadoes surrendered to the
superior forces.
With Layman and his gang in the
custody of the military, Sheriff Gal
ligan under arrest, and the morale of
the lawless element broken the cap
tors of Chief of Police and his as
sistant dared not carry out the ? r
plan to murder the officers, but hold
ing them in the Marion jail incom
municado throughout Saturday and
until Sunday noon, released them
with a warning.
Investigation Continues
With Sheriff Galligan and his dep-
(Continued from page 1)
uties under arrest the County Coro
ner, W. H. McGowan, automatically
succeeds to the position of ranking
officer of the law in Williamson
county. He is not looked upon as
strong supporter of the good citi
zens’ clean-up campaign, nor is he
expected to be of material assist
ance in securing evidence against
those men under arrest charged with
murder, nor in apprehending others
who are believed to have been in
volved.
In view of these facts Acting Chief
of Police Young is burdened with the
responsibility of bringing the guilty
to justice. His office in the city hall
is the center of activities and with
his citizen aides he is systematically
following up every clue that will be
of value in the prosecution of the
gangsters who have terrorized this
county so long.
Mr. Young told me that scores of
men who have been allied in the
crimes that have blackened this com
munity are voluntarily giving him in
formation now that the immunity of
their leaders are crumbled. These
men implicate others who are imme
diately sent for and questioned.
testimony is being taken down by
stenographers and it will make up a
record that is sure to convict many
men who have held positions of pub
lic trust in this city and county.
Leaders See Hope
It is felt here that if the national
guard is withdrawn; the men under
arrest and their confederates who
have not yet been apprehended,
brought to honest trial; and perma
nent injunctions secured against the
52 places in Herrin and vicinity that
were selling liquor in open defiance
of the law; the better element can
maintain control of the county and
city governments and conduct them
like inherently American communi
ties should be conducted.
Among the men who believe this
are:
George H. Harrison, President of
the First National Bank.
Henry LeMaster, Secretary of the
Herrin Building and Loan Assn.
H. D. Yuille, Leading merchant.
Carl Neilson, Manager, Wholesale
Grocery.
Dr. L. E. Kane, Physician.
Police Magistrate Hicks.
H. A. Bryson, Mine official.
H. O. Fowler, Leading grocer.
W. H. Smith, Garage owner and
auto dealer.
Dr. S. Channess, Physician.
Rev. I. E. Lee, Pastor First Bap
tist Church.
Rev. P. R. Glotfelty, Pastor First
M. E. Church.'
Charles Cargal, Credit Manager,
Herrin Supply Co.
Rev. W. G. Storey, Pastor First
Christian Church.
City Aldermen: C. G. Copeland,
Thomas Walty, Chas. E. Dunham,
Alvin, Misker, Carl Nall (five out of
eight members).
The best citizens of the county
have the utmost confidence in S.
Glenn Young, who was sent here at
the request of a Citizens’ Committee
that could no longer tolerate the
open defiance of law that had come to
be characteristic of Williamson coun
ty. Endorsed by high government
officials, and empowered by United
States authorities to act, Young was
assured by the Klan that he would
have the active co-operation of mem
bers of that organization when need
ed, and its moral and financial sup
port at all times.
He is not a stranger in this sec
tion. Young remarked to me, with
a characteristic grin, “No wonder
these fellows that we’ve locked up
don’t like me, and that the bootleg
gers we’ve raided think that I’m a
nuisance, to say the least of it. Four
years ago, when I was a Federal
agent here, I arrested practically the
same crowd on very similar charges
that have gotten them into trouble
this time.”
In addition to the hold that his
duties have, a sentimental attach
ment makes Mr. Young feel at home
here. His wife, too, feels that Her
rin is home, for her father, George
B. Simcox, was for nine years United
States marshal in this district and
she is widely acquainted throughout
Williamson and surrounding counties.
The Youngs-have a small son, who
with his mother, are the inspiration
behind that fearless “two-gun” up
holder of law and order, S. Glenn
Young.
The obsequies for the martyred
constable, Caesar Cagle, held at the
First Baptist Church, Sunday after
noon were the most largely attended
of any similar ceremony in this sec
tion of the state. Two hours were
required for his friends and admirers
to march past hi 3 bier in the ves
tibule of the church. It is estimated
that 5,000 automobiles made up the
cortege that followed the body to
Oakhill cemetery, the place of inter
ment.
The floral offerings were never
surpassed in number, beauty nor sig
nificance of design in this section of
the state. Conspicuous among them
all was a floral casket cover in which
the design “K. K. K.” was worked in
red flowers, The church and the al
tar were beautifully and appropriate
ly decorated.

Tribute to Cagle
Antigo, Wis., m the United States of America,
the Moh Rules as Red as in Old Russia
The story was brought to Indian
apolis this week, by one of the men
vitally concerned, of how a city of
8,000 population (Antigo, Wis.) is
misruled by alien prejudice. Mil
waukee newspapers and the newspa
per at Antigo published versions of
the episode, which took place Jan
uary 25. But these versions differ
greatly from the real facts as related
to a representative of The Fiery
Cross by a national speaker for the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, one of
the men concerned.
Captain P. P. Brush, an organizer
for the Ku Klux Klan, and the na
tional speaker, were mobbed in a
hotel in Antigo in the presence of
the chief of police and other officers
of the law of Antigo, and driven out
of the city. The rooms of Captain
Brush, one of which was occupied by
his wife and two children, were raid
ed. Captain Brush and Mrs. Brush
were roughly handled, and Captain
Brush was forcibly taken from the
hotel, thrown into an automobile and
driven several miles into the country
in 18 below zero weather, and was
kept out in this freezing temperature
several hours. Threats of death were
made and the mob was prevented
from carrying out the most dastard
ly treatment only because the mob
could not drive to a destination in
the country because of the snowdrifts
which made the road impassable for
automobiles.
The Rusht of The Mob
The facts, as given by the national
lecturer, are in substance as follows:
“Captain Brush had been in Antigo
a few days arranging for a meeting
which I was to address. I arrived
in Antigo about 3 o’clock the after
noon of January 25, went to the hotel
where Captain Brush and his family
weic stopping. We had a confer
ence regarding the meeting. Captain
Brush told me of the attempt to in
timidate him and we were not greatly
surprised about 5 o’clock in the after
noon when a mob of probably 30
men came rushing into the hotel
lobby. They recognized Captain
Brush and the leaders made for him.
He met them calmly and attempted
to reason with them. Finally some
one in the mob suggested that they
search his room. Obtaining the keys
the mob rushed up the stairs to his
room. The adjoining room was oc
cupied by Mrs. Brush and their two
children. Captain Brush followed
the mob upstairs, fearing for the
safety of Mrs. Brush and the chil
dren. When he arrived at the room
he was seized, beaten and hauled
downstairs. When the mob reached
the lobby I insisted that the chief of
police go to Captain Brush’s aid. He
finally did and promised the mob he

Washington, D. C. —“The Roman
Catholic ‘System,’ as is well known,
has a two-fold nature, religious and

“In this ambition to dominate poli

How well the above quotations fit
into what follows. There is in Wash

Take for instance, the Teapot Dome

the public resources of America are
being used like they are to carry out
this scheme of hiring public men,

would take Captain Brush to the po
lice station and would see that he
left town on the first train.
Turned Loose in Mob *
“Reaching the outside of the hotel,
the police chief was told that he was
wanted in the hotel, and he released
Captain Brush in the midst of the
mob, by that time several hundred
men. This was what the mob want
ed. Several men seized Capt. Brush;
he was hurled into an automobile
and away the mob went, headed for
the country. That was the last I
heard of him for three hours.
“Soon a part of the mob was back
in the hotel to get me. I demanded
that the police chief take me to po
lice headquarters and he finally
started with me, with a howling
mob at our heels. Arriving at the
police headquarters I asked permis
sion to telephone to Milwaukee. This
was refused. Then I demanded that
the police get on the trail of the mob
in charge of Captain Brush. My
pleadings were of no avail. This was
my eighth experience with mobs, but
I will say I never experienced such
fear for the safety of a friend as I
did in the hours that followed be
fore we had word that Captain Brush
was safe in a saloon in the town.
He had ben taken there by the mob
after it had been unable to carry out
its dastardly plans because of the
drifted conditions of the roads.
“The mob’s intention in the begin
ning was to take Captain Brush to a
secluded spot five miles in the coun
try and apply the tar and feathers
treatment. Unble to get to the
place, they decided to tie him up to
a telephone pole and leave him there
in 18 below zero weather. Someone
in the mob prevailed against this,
knowing it meant sure death to Cap
tain Brush, and they were too cow
ardly to take the chance.
Trying to Get Rid of Him
“Someone suggested he be placed
aboard a freight train that was due
at the spot where the mob then was,
near the edge of the city. It was
found the freight train had been an
nulled, and the mob was beginning
to cool off. The result was that Cap
tain Brush was brought to the saloon
and the police department was noti
fied to come and get him. He was
brought to the police station and
there he and I were held for hours
with no protection from the wrath
of the mob. Captain Brush was
nearly frozen and had been so se
cerely manhandled that he was suf
fering intensely. We had to wait
several hours, until 11 p. m., for a
train and what we went through is
indescribable.
“However, the most vivid thing in
my mind is the bursting into the
men are doing the same, yet others
are caught in the dragnet.
Will such interests dare go as far
as to attempt to break into our pub
lic school system? There is no tell
ing how far they will make efforts
to carry out their system.
Many public mert have been hired
or bought up apparently without
knowing it or realizing what they
have done. Of course, they must
give something in return. If this
force is so silent and invisible that
the best minds in America can’t see
it, it remains the duty of the Ku Klux
Klan to bring it into the open and ex
pose the master mind and master
hand.
It’s amazing to the men themselves
who have been led into it blindly.
When they find it out, they resign
or make a quick get-away. Mr. Mc-
Adoo resigned in a hurry when he
found out what was going on. Watch
others scatter.

him than censure. For several min
utes he gave vent to his wrath, but
finally I appealed to him as a Mason
to a Mason, and got in a word or two
that quieted him. He is thinking
differently now, I feel sure.
Chief Went Home
“Eventually I noticed the absence
of the police chief, and asked an offi
cer where he was. The officer said:
‘Oh, he has gone home to bed.’ Gone
home to bed, leaving two lives in
jeopardy, whose safety he was
sworn to protect? I demanded the
officer call him and get him back to
the office to escort us to the station.
My demand prevailed and he came
back. Then he was going to march
us to the station. I demurred and
finally had to threaten that if ' he
persisted in this and did not give us
protection on the way to the station,
I would put the matter before the
governor. This argument prevailed
and he called a closed automobile and
we were taken to the station in safe
ty.
“Then I proposed that we be per
mitted to enter the train from the
platform of the rear coach, which
was back several car lengths from
the station platform, where the mob
was awaiting us. He demurred at
this, intending to take us through
the mob to the only coach open for
receiving passengers. More persua
sion and more threats of putting the
affair up to the governor finally went
home and the rear door of the last
coach was opened and we were aboard
before the mob realized we were at
the station. Members of the mob was
prepared for us and when they saw
that we were entering the train at
the rear they came sweeping toward
that platform, armed with, I don’t
know what, but with eggs or rocks
or other missies, which would have

Washington, D. C.—The political
game is a warm one these days in the
National Capital and the heat is on
both sides, each trying to take ad
vantage of the other and see who

The fuss all comes out of the dis

of former Secretary of the Interior

President Coolidge got busy ik a

had been disclosed before the Senate
committee and he issued a statement

the cases; saying in a few words:
“If there is any guilt it will be pun

will be enforced; if there is any fraud
it will be revealed; and if there are
any contracts which are illegal they
will be cancelled.” This statement

the statement made by P. P. Brush,
Ku Klux Klan organizer, just before
he left Antigo last night. Brush,
with his wife and children and a fel
low worker, were taken from the
Schneiter hotel by a group of citi
zens shortly after 5 o’clock yesterday
afternoon.
“A Number of Committees”
“A number of committees and in
dividuals called upon the organizer
during the last three days of his ten
day stay here and requested, advised
and warned that he leave the city.
The people who called upon him, like
the crowd which was present to see
him ejected from the city, was made
up of men from all walks of life and
representing all religious creeds. A
committee from the American Legion
waited upon Brush yesterday and
advised him to leave.
“At five o’clock yesterday about
fifty men gathered at a downtown
hall and went to the hotel. Brush
was found in his room, and was taken
away to await the departure of the
limited last night. Both he and his
companion spent the evening at the
police station. His companion, whose
name was not learned, was taken
from" the hotel by the police, who
feared violence. Later Brush joined
his co-worker, and the two were es
corted to the station and deposited
aboard the train by the police. Mrs.
Brush was allowed to remain at the
hotel. Brush and his wife went to
Milwaukee, the other man giving Des
Moines, la., as his destination.’
The Antigo newspaper carried the
following statement signed by the
owner of the hotel where Captain
Brush and the lecturer were mobbed:
“In view of the fact that the dis
turbance last evening occurred at my
hotel, it is only fair that I make a
statement in connection with the af
fair.
“Several days ago a gentleman
came to my hotel and engaged a room
and stated that he might later hold
a small meeting there, not intimat
ing, however, the character of the
same, so I had no occasion to refuse
him. There was no suggestion or
statement made regarding a banquet.
“When I learned later, however, of
the character of the meeting to be
held I informed him that it could not
be held at the hotel and the meeting,
as far as the Schneiter hotel was
concerned, had been called off, and
no meeting was to be held there last
evening.
“I make this statement so that the
public may know that I in no way
encouraged or countenanced the per
fecting of such an organization as
was contemplated.”

committee, made an attack on the
administration which involved the en
tire cabinet under President Harding
in which President Coolidge sat and
participated. Senator Walsh read
letters into the record which show
ed the knowledge President Harding
had of the matter and that the oil
leases had been the subject of much
discussion in the cabinet meetings of
those days and there was much doubt
of the legality of the affair at the
time.
While the White House was taking
swift steps Sunday to appoint two na
tionally known attorneys, one Republi
can and the other Democrat, to in
augurate court action to recover the
leases, Senator Walsh submitted his
resolution in the Senate directing the
President to take such action and to
stop further extraction of oil from the
great reserves at Teapot Dome and
Elk Hills.
So now both old parties will go be
fore the country and claim the credit
for exposing this nasty affair to the
people. Just before the President
issued his statement Sunday night he
was in conference with Senator Len
root and other Republican leaders,
Lenroot being chairman of the Sen
ate committee on Public Lands which
is making the investigation.
