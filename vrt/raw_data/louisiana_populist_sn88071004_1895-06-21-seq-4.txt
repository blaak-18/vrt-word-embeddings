1REVIEW OF DURIBANT.
THE ALLEGED SAN FRANCISCO
FIEND "SIZED UP."
POSSIBILY ANOTHER "DR. JEKYLL.
AND lMI. HlYDE."
i{htle Studying Surgery lie May Hiase
Taken on a Dealre to Do Murder
The Jury May Have a lltiicult
Task.
F TIIEOCDO(RE
Durrant, the San
- /. Francisco medical
student and Sun
day-school man, is
found guilty of
murdering Blanchel
.amont and Mlnni.
SWilliams America
will see in the mur
derer a character
much like Novelist
Stevenson's terrible
creation, Dr. J.kyll and Mr. Hyde. It
will be shown, moreover, that In men
with a dangerous strain already in the
blool. latent perhaps at first, the know!
edge of surgery, of dissection, the dis
regard of the horrible learned in th.,
laboratory, may breed strange criminal
instincts, and, to some extent, guard
the guilty against the consequences of
crimes born of such instincts. Durrant
studied surgery. Did he study Murder
at the same time? The police answer
in the affirmative.
Assuming that Durrant is guilty, as
chaaned by the coroner's jury, what a
remarkable life was his before and
after the crimes: Edward Hyde, when
he had killed and mutilated Sir Dan
vein Carew, fled like a hunted animal
to his study, where he could put on
respectability and safety in the per
sonality of Dr. Jekyll.
Now, see with what they charge I)ur
rant. While one victim lay dead in the
church belfry, he lured another to the
pastor's study, below that very belfry,
killed her, hid the remains, and then
went to a social meeting at the resl
dence of a church member where she
was expected that night, washed what
he said was dust from his hands, greet
ed his friends-and hers-with hearti
ness, played games until the party brk,
up. and then went back to Emanuel
church.
Minnie Williams was not present.
She had been killed within the hour.
But Durrant was there, and much in
evidence. It may have been Edward
Hyde putting on Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll,

tracks. o80, It s charged. Durrant did
not go home after he left this meeting,
but went back to the church to cover
up his crime. The first murder was
not discovered for ten days. And yet.
unless a premature discovery marred
the murderer's plans, unless he meant
to dismember his victims and in time
remove them from the church, it was
simple madness to hope that the crimes
could be hidden.
The sequence of the story which the
police have put together has suffered
greatly, because it has been told here
in fragments. In theory it dates back
some months. At that time Eugene
Ware a dreg clerk, was murdered and
mutilated. The crime remained a mys
tery. Blanche Lamont, one of the girls
whose bodies were found in the church.
boarded for a time at the same house
with Ware. Theodore Durrant knew
both. When Ware was killed there was
some vague talk about a woman In the
case, talk that died out as the murder
grew cold. So much for Ware. Dur
rant, at this time, was in his senior
year at Cooper medical college. Some
students who knew him Intimately say
he spoke strangely about women from
time to time and read much on subjects
which are safest in the hands of hard
headed specialists. Otherwise, he was
a man much like the ordinary, except,
perhaps, that he spent more time in
church or in the company of church
going young women. He is of ordinary
height, light and strong. His hands
are large and powerful. His face sug.
gat strength, determination and a de
gree of vanity. His eyes re good, but
the nose and mouth glit . the fir an
ugly look when seen In profile. Not long
before the murder he enticed Mlnnje
Williams to the suburb, of the city and
there nslulted her. For a time nhe
avoided him, but he succeeded in re
gaining her oomademaoe If Blanhe La.

cine once when she was ll and after
wards atteIpted to nhtice her into the
pastor's study On the plea that if she
would grant him a physician's privilege
he would cure her. She upbraided him
and left him.
The ether girls. ringularly enough,
,ere close friends, resembleid each
other in appearane and twer.' not liv
ing with their larents. Thus they were
easier prey.

mere than "). .Minni. W\'illiams. whse
parents do n-t lice t,e ther, htad made
her home with a distant relative In Al
medta, a sublurb of San Francisco.
What did Bllanch, Iamont know of the
murder of Eugene Ware? The police
would give muich to determine. It was
iBlanche Lamont who disappeared first.
She left the high school on the afternoon
of April 3. mot Durrant, say witnesses
who saw them together, and went with
him toward the church. She was inter
ested In co. king. There was a book in
the church library oin that subject.
While It was yet light and the church
was likely t,, be visited by the organ
ist. the pastor and others, Blanche La
mont entered. She never leit it. Min
ni.- Williams was perhaps more anxious
than any one else over Blanthe La
mont's aibsene. Eight days later she
lft Almedan. went to Mrs. Foy's house
in the city, preparatory to attending a
(c'hjistian Endeavor society meeting
thalrt evening at I)r. ',ogil's. She was
to meet IDurrant, it is believed. Sh,.o
perhaps, knew me'st about Durrant.
She was the person most likely to con
nect him with Blanche Lamont's disap
pearance. Women who were decorat
ing Emanuel church on April 3 looked
in a closet off the pastor's study for
something they needed and found the
body of Minnie Williams hacked with
many wounds. She had been killed with
a kitchen knife after a brutal fashion,
and her body concealed in the eloset.
Afterward it became known that an
other crime had been attempted before
her life was taken.
The police on the following day forced
the door at the head of a narrow stair
case leading from the pastor's study to
the belfry, and there in a dark corner.
they found the body of Blanche La
mont, divested of all clothing, with the
marks (of the strangler on the throat.
Blood on the stair indicated that she
had been killed below and carried into
the belfry after death.
It wea then that George It. King re
memlrered that he had been playing the
organ in the church on the day of
Blanche Lamont's disappearance, when
Theodore Durrant staggered out from
the stairway leading from the belfry
white and trembling, and begged for a
bromo seltzer. After King ran out and
got it Durrant explained that he had
been fixing the electric wires In the bel
fry, and had been nearly suffocated by
escaping gas-a statement which has
since been partially disproved. In al
of the tragedy there is a suggestion
of monomania which recalls Durrant's
conversation with his fellow students.
It is known that he had attempted to
make one of the girls his victim, per
haps the other. Blanche Lamont may
have had a suspicion about Eugene
Ware, or she may simply have steadily
opposed the object with which Durrant
is thought to have cultivated her ac
quaintance. Miss Williams, who al
ready knew something of Durrant's
real character, rpay have had a sus
picion regarding the other girl's disap
pearance. Added to these possible mo
tives which are offered in explanation
of the crimes, there is that trend of
mind which dwells upon the morbid
and selects in a course of study those
subjects upon which a diseased imagi
nation is prone to feed.
It seems now that the defense will
be insanity, coupled with the plea that
the evidence is inclusive. Durrant must
be acquitted entirely, found guilty of
deliberate murder, or adjudged insane
and imprisoned for life. There is no
halt way measure possible. He is not
without friends and sympathizers. His
mother is his stanchest advocate, just
as was the aged mother of Carlyle iHar
ris,whose history in some respects re
sembles that of Durrant. The Chris
tian Endeavor meeting and Durrant's
appearance there will be wonderfully
handled, no doubt, by defense and pros
ecution. His demeanor there recalls an
incident somewhat similar in the great
Borden case in Fall River, Mass., where
Andrew Borden and his wife Abbie
were brutally mardered and no one
was punished.

Cremation Not Christian,
Cremation services have been
oflicially declared by Masonic author
ity not to be C'irietian burial. 'I'ie
question that has brought out this
decision arose over the making of ar
rangemnents for the funeral of the late
Charles 11. l(eisser, the well known
I'hiiladelphia restauranteur, some time
ago. It had always been Mr. ;eis.
er's wish to be cremated, and after
his death his family decided to follo*
his wishes. lie was a Ma'son and a
member of Rising Star Lodge, Ori
ental Chapter, and of Kadosh Com
mandery. Those organizations were
invited to take part in the funeral,
but, before accepting, it was learned
that it was the intention to have the
services at the time the body was
cremated. The question was at once
raised whether, under Masonic law,
this would be a Christian burial.
The matter was referred to the (.rand
Master of Pennsylvania, who is Judge
Arnold, and lie promptly rendered a
deci-ion that services at a cremation
were not Christian burial under Mla
sonic law. 'lTcre is much to be said
against cremation by those who love
display funnerals and have no terrours
of cold graves and worms that eat
beloved bodies.
A Hlard Case.
It is reported in New York that one
Michael Riley, at Grconpoint, visited
hospitable friends a few nights ago.
It was after midnight when he set
out for hmine. lie stopped at, Green
point and Manhattan avenues and
wa.ked in unobserved by Sergeant
(;allagiher, who was busy. RIiiey
went into the room of Capt. Rhodes,
who was out. lie fell asleep on the
captain's lounge, and his snoring at
tracted Sergeant Gallaglher, who
woke iiimn up and had him hauled out
before the desk, arraigned for drunk
enness and locked up. In the police
court the next morning Riley said
that he mistook the station-house for
his own home. lie was discharged.
There are mitigating circumstances
in this cast'. If the man had a home
that in a'y way resembled a police
station, he should have sympathy for
that; if he had a snore eloquent
enough to arouse a police station, he
should have credit for that.

The best cleaning compound for

and one of sulphuric acid. The arti

which it is washed with water, rinsed
with alcohol and wiped dry with a
clean rag. The dirtiest of nickel
goods is said to come out with a
