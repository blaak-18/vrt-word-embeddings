more pleasure than to speak a good
word for you, and about you, at all
times. You were a friend to me when
I was a small boy. My grandfather
was old and sick with consumption,
and unable to work, and was poor and
was living in Thomson at that time,
and you came to our relief. Well do
I remember, although I was only
nine years old, when yon would come
down to our house to she what was
needed, let it be something to eat or
wood, or medicine, you were ready to
give.
Mr. Watson, I expect you have
forgotten all of this, and would like
to know who it was, but I never will
forget it as long as I am- living. And
I must not forget your good wife.
She was just as good to my mother
ind grandmother as she could be, and
expect she has forgotten to whom
he loaned a helping hand in time of
iced, but God has it all recorded in a
•righter land.
Enclosed find sl, for which please
renew my subscription to the Jeffer
sonian. Also list of names to which
please send sample copies of Jeffer
sonian, and I will try to get some
of them to subscribe. I don’t know
how many I have sent before. Please
let me know what I can do on re
newals. I have your card stating
about new ones. I do not want any
commission. With best wishes and
much love, I remain
Your true friend,
THOMAS E. CARTLEDGE.
WHY NOT, INDEED?

Hon. Th os. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: I see from the papers
Secretary Cortelyou will issue fifty
millions in U. S. bonds, and one hun
dred millions in certificates. Will the
latter bear a legal tender quality?
Why not issue greenbacks? It is the
proper thing for our local banks to do,
to send the money of depositors, on
which there is no security, to be used
without security by speculators in
other locations than that in which
the money belongs? What will ba
the result when the masses of de
positors understand that their money
is shipped off to Northern banks, and
they are left to do business on
checks? What has become of the
150 millions of gold reserve? Is this
the kind of occasion for which it was
intended? Your attention will oblige
Your friend,
WILLIAM W. ANDERSON.

Hartford, Ala., Nov. 19, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Enclosed find P. 0. or
der for three subscriptions to the
Jeffersonian. We can not get along
without it. I have been reading af
ter you for fifteen years. I think
you have done more for the educa
tion of the masses than any man in
America, and we do hope and trust
the Lord may let you live long to con
tinue the fight until the battle is
won. It is a fact that everything is
being brought to bear to oppress the
laborer more and more. Why is it
that our president will not use the
power of the constitution and help
the masses to tide over the so-called
panic is a question that is confront
ing the people just now. Success to
the Jeffersonian and its many read
ers.

SHAMEFUL CONDITIONS—SUCH
BANKING IS CRIMINAL.
Hackberry, Okla, Nov. 14, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: Your favor of the sth
inst. at hand, and was thankfully re
ceived. Our situation here is terrib
ly hard. The banks have opened and
no money. They pay to each de
positor $5 each day; and no sale for
produce. They caught me for nearly
$l5O, and my wheat not sold, nor any
thing else that calls for cash. I only
had five or six dollars when we were
locked out. I can’t get enough to
buy our groceries.
My time is out for the Weekly Jef
fersonian, but I will come again. 1
will take it as long as I live, and it
is printed. I have almost all of the
papers of the last year, and will hand
them out and work for both Jeffer
sonians. Will drive over the country
and do all I can. We need an able
speech to show and circulate. Have
one published. I send you our family
paper. See letter to Roosevelt.

FROM OLD VIRGINIA.
Madison, Va., Nov. 18, 1907.
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Sir: As my subscription to
your Jeffersonian Magazine expired, I
believe, with the November number,
I herewith enclose you my check fo'.
$1.50 for a renewal of my subscrip
tion for another year. I have been a
reader of your magazine since your
first venture in New York, and when
your connection with the New York
magazine ceased, it had no further
interest for me. As soon as I found
out that you had begun the publica
tion of the present one, I hastened to
subscribe, and expect to continue my
subscriptions as long as you continue
the magazine. If there is any man
in America who can write a better
editorial than you, I have yet to find
him out. I hope you will continue
the good work you have begun, and
that as each year passes your field of
labor may grow larger and larger, and
that the seeds you have sown may pro
duce an abundant harvest in the days
to come.
Sincerely yours,
C. F. M ’MULLAN.
THIS IS SINCERELY APPRECI
ATED.

Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
Dear Mr. Watson: You will find
enclosed a P. O. money order for
$2.50, which I send you for both your
monthly and Wetekljy, for another
year. This is full price, or, at least,
all you ask for your papers, but I feel
that I get more than my money’s
worth at that price. I can’t do with
out either, and I think that every
body ought to take your papers. We
all know you are honest and true,
and a friend to the common or labor
ing people, and that you are doing a
great work for the human under dog.
Yours truly,

BRYAN HAS BEEN TRYING TO
DENY.
Mt. Vernon, Ind., Oct. 7, 1907.
Dear Sir: In regard to the inquiry
Hon. Thos. E. Watson, Thomson, Ga.
of Mr. Strange, of Welch, I. T., as to
Bryan’s statements in the Parker
campaign of 1904, will say that on
the same day that Mr. Bryan spoke
at Vincennes, he spoke at Mt. Ver
non, and in his speech here he re
ferred to Judge Parker as the
11 Moses of the Democratic party”;
that Parker’s “ideals were his
ideals,” and with great emphasis he
assured his audience that he “was
more interested in the election of
Judge Parker than he ever was in his
own at any time.” What the voters
of Indiana thought of these state
ments was shown in the 100,000 ma
jority vote given Roosevelt —a ma
jority the most enthusiastic Repub
lican never dreamed of. In that cam
paign Mr. Bryan lost a prestige ha
will never regain.
