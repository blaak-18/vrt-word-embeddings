WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Papir !
a Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
t can artists, and contributed to by the
ty most popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfillly up
a. on the sixth year of its existence, and
t has become the established humorous and
na satirical paper of the country. It was
t started and continued the first year as a
U monthly, then, to satisfy the demand of
"t the public, it was changed to a fortnight
n. ly. Still continuing its good work of
it hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
n" the political and social shams by its
at masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
u' it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
- have yielded still further to the public
e demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
pe present shape op its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly humorous
t paper ever published in this country.
I* Among the artists especially engaged
At to furnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
0. Frank Bellow, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
it Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettels,
Stuckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
it others who are yet known to fame.
R. In its literary departments Wild Oats
it will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
e and character writers in the United
h States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparking, original and pointed.
f Wild Oats will be first-class min every
ºt particular, and on this aceount may be
taken into the best families without fear
t or suspicion, as no word or illustration
s will appear that can offend the most fas
tidious.
