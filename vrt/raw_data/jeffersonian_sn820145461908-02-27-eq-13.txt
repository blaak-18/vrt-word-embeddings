Are You
Sick?
Much sickness is due to
■a weak nervous system.
Yours may be. If it is,
you cannot get well until
you restore nerve strength
Your nervous system is
nature’s power house; the
organs of your body get
their power from it. If
the power is not there, the
action of the organs is
weak, and disease (sick
ness) follows. Dr. Miles’
Nervine cures the sick
because it soothes the
irritated and tired nerves
and gives the system a
chance to recuperate.
Try it, and see if you do
not quickly feel its bene
ficial effect.
“I was given up to die by a lead
ing doctor. Got one of Dr. Miles
books and found that Dr. Miles’ Ner
vine fit my case. From the very first
dose I took I got better. lam better
now than I have Deen for years, and
de all my own work on the farm.
That’s what Dr. Miles’ Nervine has
done for me, and I am glad to recom
mend it to others.”
JOHN JAMES. Riverton, Nebr.

ine, and we authorize him to return
