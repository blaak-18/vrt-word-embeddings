The colored' lepublicas have is
sued so address to the people ofLu
isians, which taking it all together, is
one of the most singular dpamets
we have ever seen. We are a little
suspicious of the whole affair and it
smacks like "fature evidence" to us.
At all events, we will wager that this
is not the last we 'vi hear from it;
and if the spirit f the address is not
used to "fasten a loap" in the 'frail
Kellogg government, we will beniich
mistaken.
Here is what our able cotemporary,
the Shreveport se. siys of it :
Proceeding, the address says:
"Weare depressed and sickened by.
the unsettled and disordered state of
society, and would gladly welcome
any solution consistent with honor,
sad compatible with the. liberties of
our people. We are ready and wily
ling to adopt any honorable adjust
ment tending to harmonize the races.
With our unitled purpose overtures
of concession at any previous period
in our political dspedrence might have
suggested that we were influenced by
improper motives, or that we had
taken counsel of our fears, but now,
with the tramp of Federal soldiers on
every street, with gunboats and mon
itors in our waters, with the mighty
sentiment of the North pledged to the
protection of our liberties and citizen
ship, and with the Irresistible power
of the general government guarantee.
ing the full existence of our rights,
we, while independent of the poli
cal favor of our white fellow-eitizens,
are willing to concede sa equitable
and honorable basis for united action,
free from suspicion sad restraint ad
the interest of giod government."
This strikes as as extremely absurd.
The negroes, as it is admitted in this
address, have by their' smufages es
tablished in tlis'State a government
composed of white thieves and ad
venturers, and the most unscrupulous
of their own race, and for years kept
it in power; kept it in power, until it
has absolutely- ruined the people of
the State, white and black, And now,
when the whltj eople have arisen in
their might to ovetthrtb 'tat Infa
mous government, this committee of
colored men selly step forward, ex
press their silctapes at wtlthea have
done, and, claiming that the Federal
army and navy are at.their back, de
ntand of us "an adjustment tending
to harmanize the races, etc."
The white people can not now en
tertain this very supercilious propo
sition. For six years, governments
elected by the negroee hae rouled thls
State; the Southern white citizens
have acatually had no control what
ever in public affairs, and now we
have a pretty Ipes" ,f it;. Ps ~P ver
which even the lbttr cla sof pr
have grown di asted and .iek, d8
they themselves declare. The remedy
of the public evils, in view of these
facts, cannot .be prudently entrasted,
even in a partial measure, to the ne
-groes--to the men whose folly, and
prejudices and Ignorance have pro
duced them. The intelligence of the
State alone can bring order out of
chaos, and if the negroes are sincere
in their desire to re-establish the reign
of virtue, intelligence and economy,
let them ast like hone sand slcnre
men; come farward and vote for the
candidates the white people have
uominated, This isthr, qp iadjust

The following press dispatch ap
peared in our issue of the 8th :
The advisory boardiheld a astormy
session to-day, lasting five or six
hours. Mr. Packard introduced a re
solution stating that white leagues
were still being organised andlarmed,
and calling for their disbandment.
This resolution was rejected and the
following, offered by E A. Burke,
was adopted -
Whereas, It has been reported to
the advisory board that armed organ
izations have recently been drilling
in the streets of New Orleans; and,
Whereas, The effect of such demon
stration in any part of the State is
calculated to create apprehension of
intimidation in the minds of the col
ored people of the State; and,
Whereas, The continuance of such
demonstration would be in violation
of the true spirit and intention of the
agreement ereating theadvisory.board,
,Be it Resolved, That the advisory
board declage the absolute necessity
and propriety of preventing such de
monstration, and requestin; such 'im.
mediate action, as will rehevb6 a l ci,
tizens from apprehensiob thata they
would in any way interfere with a
free, fall and fait regisatioue and

We hardly knw which is minost con
spicuous in this dispatch, the impu
dence of Packard or the subservency
of Burke. We know this, however,
that, Mr. Burke has not elevated him.
selfin the estijation of this people
by his impeitineut "whereases and

Packard's breach of faith in having
troops sent to North Louisiana to in
timidate the white people, and ad
vising the white people to keep np
their organizations and preserve their
arms in readiness for action should
Kellogg or his instruments seek to

Party.
We, the wite pebple df Louisiana, em
bracing the Democratic Party, the Con
servative Party, the White Man's Party,
the Liberal Party the Reform Party and
all others opposed to the Kellogg usur
pation do solemnly resolve and declare:
1. That the government now existing
in Louisiana originated in, and has been
maintained by force and fraud, in oppo
sition to the will of a large majority of
the voters of the State; in opposition to
the prsupls ea e 'Conititution of the
UIý ttateS siA violation of, every
prioipe of justice and liberty.
2 That the dominant faction of the
Radical party in this State has, by false
and fraudulent representations, inflamed
the passions and prejudices of the ne
grnes, as arace, against the whites, and
la thereby made it necessary for the
white people to unite and act together in
self-deense and the preservation of white
civilization..
3. That the tights of all men under the
Constitution and laws of the land must
be respected and preserved inviolate, ir
respective of race, color or previous con
dition, but we. deny that Congresscan
Constitutionally enact laws to force the
two races into social union or equality.
4. That the white people of Louisiana
have no desire to deprive the colored
people of any rightsto which they are en
titled, but we are convinced that the re
forms imperatively demanded, can be
effected only by electing'to office white
men of known capacity and integrity
and we believe that large numbers of
colored citizens will vote with us to se
cure a government which must be bene
ficial alike to both res.
5. Taite *es, m eanestl, any in
tention of carrying, O` atimlsting to ear
ry, the approaching election by violence,
and that charges to this effect emanating
from our Radi'ial enemies, are without
foundation and are falsely made for the
purpose of obtaining the aid of the mil
itary force of the United States in order
to over-awe the people, perpetuate the
existing usrpation and subvert the true
principles of the government.
6. That W P. l bs smere searl
er and welenonto has stleh, that his
government is arbitrary, unjust and Op
pressive; and that it can maintain it
self only through Federal Interference.
7. That the election and registration
laws under which this election is being
conducted were intended to perpetuate
the usurpation by depriving the people
and especially our naturalised eitizens of
an opportunity to register and vote, but
we annoqnoe, distinctly, that tt is the
determination of the eple toihave a
fair and free dietion  tob see that the
restlt is not chatged by fl or violence.
8. That we extend to all our race in
every clime the right hand of fellowship
and a cordial invitation to come and set
tle among us, and unite their destinies
with ours.
9. That while we are in favor of meet
Ing punctually the payment of the legit
imate debt of Louisiana, we are immo
vably opposed to the recognitions issued
in the name of the State, and we pledge
ourselves to make a searching investiga
tion in the matter.
We advise our people to vote against
t heamendments to the Constitutipn pro
posed by the usurping Legislature and
pledge ourselves on the restoration of the
government to honest hands, to provide
for the payment of all honest indebted.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821,
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
wideepread and unblemished reputation
for the unsurpassed parity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Miscellaneous reading matter.
it is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in this country, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either in
a religious or political sense, or that
could not be read at any fireside without
objection from the most fastidious.
The circulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhaps, as its younger contemporaries,
is not, like that of some of them, flucta
ating, and too often.short-Mved, but .
SURE, SOLID AND )SU1ISTAXTIAL,
based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, such as the populari
ty of individual writems, &c.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future, and with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By increasing its formqr attractions,
and adding many judicious and pleas
ing novelties, by studying how to please
and cultivate thepopular taste, by in
creasing industry and enterprise, and by
enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every issune, and
continue to maintain the elai of the
Saturday Evening Post to its title of Tns
OLsTr A"D Tma nasr of Family Story

1'HIE SALES of the SINGER last year
was the greatest ever attainedltfor
any Sewing Machine in a year, and was
nearly double the sales of its highest
com'ipetitor, as may be seen by reference
to the account of MAles for 1873, fronh
sworn returns made to the owners of the
Sawin; Machine Pateunts-from which
statistics we select the I~ve,1eading'
chines, viz:
The Singer sold 2ii,444
" Wheeler & Wilson, " 119,190
" Domestic, " 40,114
" Grover & Baker, " 36,176
" Weed, " 21,769
It will be observed that the gdifferenco
in favor of the RING(ER, is the ernrmons
amount of 113,254 over the highest com
petitor. This result has been obtained
after years of competition.
We submit to an interested public if it
