ducks ter a mighty bad market.”
When he arrived at the cross-roads
he found a crowd of men gathered
about the door of a log house which
served as a jail. Sim Bumpus and
Scott Patterson stood guard at the
door. Lige was suffered to enter.
Brezentine sat on a box. His face
wore an expression of despair.
“How are you, Lige?”
Lige nodded.
“You find me in a pretty bad fix,”
Brezentine remarked as he shoved
his hands into his pockets and leaned
back against the wall. “If they send
me to the penitentiary, it will almost
kill Millie with shame, and it will be
a disgrace to the Petticord family. I
wish I was dead.”
“So do I,” Big Lige replied.
“Don’t be too hard on me.”
“I don’t want ter be hard on yer
a-tall. It’s fur Millie’s sake that I
wish yer wuz dead. She could stan’
grief better’ll she ken disgrace. Jim
Polk Brezentine, I b’lieve yer ought
ter be in prison, fur I don’t b’lieve
God ever put a hones’ bone in yer
body; but fur Millie’s sake, an’ fur
the sake uv a ole man an’ ole woman
that I love, I won’t see yer go ter the
pen.”
“How can you help it?”
“I’ll tell 'em that I stold the mon
ey.”
“Oh, Lige’” exclaimed Brezentine.
springing to his feet. “Oh, you no
ble”—
“Don’t put yer damned han’s on
me! Set down thar, ur I’ll slam the
daylight outen yer.”
Lige epned the door and called
Patterson. “Scott,” said he, “I wush
yer’d go over an’ tell ’Squire Boyle
ter come here.”
Scott hurried away and soon re
turned, accompanied by the justice
of the peace.
“W’y, how’re yer, Big Lige?
How’s all the folks?” the magistrate
asked, as he shook hands with Lige.
“All’s well. ’Squire, yer’ve got the
wrong sow by the year, this time.
I’m the man that stold Dye’s mon
ey.”
“What?” exclaimed the ’squire.
“I say that I’m the man.”
“Wall, then, how come Jim Polk
with the money?”.
“I owed it to him, an’ I gin it to
him shortly airter I stold it.”
“Jim Polk Brezentine, is that so?”
“It is a fact, ’squire. When I was
accused of taking the money, I could
have told where I got it, but I did
Blje 3effersonian
not want to involve my friend Lige,
and, sir, if he had not confessed it, I
would have said nothing, but would
have let them send me to the peni
tentiary.”
“Mr. Brezentine,” said the ’squire,
“give me yer han’. I didn’t know,
when the folks called yer no ’count
an’ triflin’, that there wuz so much
grit in yer. Give me yer han’.”
Jim Polk and the ’squire warmly
shook hands. Big Lige shuddered
and turned his back. “Lige,” said
the ’squire, “as yer confessed, thar
ain’t no use in a preliminary trial
before me. The circuit cou’t is now
in session, an’ I’d better send yer
down right away ter be tried. Mr.
Brezentine, yer can go home, sir.”
“Wall, wall,” said old man Petti
cord, when Brezentine had related
Lige’s confession, “I never woulder
b’lievcd that he wuz a thief. What
is ther worl’ a cornin’ ter?”
“Cornin’ ter a eend mighty fast,”
replied his wife, as she ceased rat
tling her knitting-needles and gazed
thoughtfully into the fire. “Pore
Lige!”
That evening, as Brezentine and
his wife were walking toward home,
Millie said:
“Pore Lige. I thought he was one
of the bes’ men in the worl’.”
“If he’s guilty, an’ hd certainly is,
what is the use of pitying him? You
think more of him than you do of
me, anyway.”
“Jim Polk, what’s the use of talk
in’ that way?”
“Well, you do.”
“Now, Jim Polk”—
“Oh, shut up. You are sorry now
that I didn’t go on trial in his place.
I am getting sick of hearing you talk
of him.”
Lige’s trial consumed but little
time, as there was no pretense of de
fense. Old man Petticord was in the
court-room when Big Lige received
his sentence of two years in the peni
tentiary. The old man seized the
giant’s hand and wept like a child.
“My dear ole frien’,” said Lige,
“think uv me ez well ez yer ken, fur
thar will come er time —but no mat
ter. Tell ’em all at home that I love
’em. Tell ’em that I would die fur
’em. Tell Millie that —that —she
mustn’t think too hard uv poor Lige.

“By George, I never saw anything
like the effects of that new treatment,
Protone, for the building up of weight
and lost nerve force. It acted more
like a miracle than a medicine,” said
a well known gentleman yesterday in
speaking of the revolution that had
taken place in his condition. “I be
gan to think that there was nothing
on earth that could make me fat. I
tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating,
diets, milk, beer and almost everything
else you could think of, but without
result. I had been thin for years, and

began to think it was natural for me
to be that way. Finally I read about
the remarkable processes brought
about by the use of Protone, so I de
cided to try it myself. Well, when I
look at myself in the mirror now, I
think it is somebody else. I have put
on just 30 pounds during the last
month and never felt stronger or more
•nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful inducer of nu
trition, increases cell-growth, makes
perfect the assimilation of food, in
creases the number of blood-corpus
cles, and as a necessary result builds
up muscles and solid, healthy flesh, and
rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear
stylish in anything they wear because
of their thinness, this remarkable
treatment may prove a revelation. It
is a beauty maker as well as a form
builder and nerve strengthener.
It will cost you nothing to prove the
remarkable effects of this treatment.
It is absolutely non-in jurious to the
most delicate system. The Protone
Company, 1530 Protone Bldg., Detroit,
Mich., will send to anyone who sends
name and address, a free 50c package
of Protone, with full instructions, to
