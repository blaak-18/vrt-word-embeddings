WHY THE MASONIC LODGE IS FORBIDDEN BY
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH -
(From the pen’ of a Jesuit, Ecclesiastical Review, Feb. 1923.)
Priests are often asked by nominal
Catholics why they should not b$
free to join the Masons. The answer
is that the beliefs and principles of
Catholics and Freemasons are oppos
ed to each other, as is evident —
L
From Authority—All the Popes
who have condemned Freemasonry
say .that a Catholic cannot be a Ma
son. The chief ones are: Clement
XII, in 1738; Benedict XIV, in 1751;
Pius VII, 1821; Leo XII, in 1825;
Pius VIII, in J. 829; Gregory XVI, in
1839; Pius IX, in 1846 and 1865, and
on four ether occasions; Leo XIII,
five different time, but especially in
the Encyclical “Humanum Genus’* of
April 20, 1884, and Pius X, in 1911.
No Catholic, who has not lost bis
judgment will believe that in mat
ters of religion he knows more than
all these Popes combined.
11.
From Private Experience.—lt is a
fact that when a Catholic becomes a
Mason and lives as such he ceases to
practice his religion. It is not be
cause they forbid him to do so in the
Lodge but because they make an un
believer of him.
Those very persons who on their
initiation into Masonry endeavor to
steer a middle path, going both to
the Lodge and to the Church, end by
becoming, unbelievers.
Whoever wishes a proof of this
statement need only make a list of
our best known public men, who
were Catholics in youth and are now
well known as Masons, and he will
see that none of these retains any of
his Catholic faith.
111.
From Public Experience.—All the
revolutions engineered by Masonry
have been so many persecutions of
religion. Amongst others may be re
called the French Revolution of 1789,
the Italian of 1848, the Spanish of
1869, that of Commune of Paris
in 1871; that of Portugal in 1910;
and that of Mexico in 1911 and later
years.
IV.
Intrinsic.—A man cannot be at the
same time a Catholic and a Mahome
tan because Catholicity and Ma
hometanism teach different doctrines.
For the same reason a man cannot
be a Catholic and a Mason.
Let us compare some fundamental
propositions of both religions.
Catholic Proposition.—God is the
Creator of the world out of nothing.
Masonic Proposition.—God is the
architect of the universe, and formed
it of eternal matter.
Catholic.—God is One in Essence
and three in Persons.
Masonic.—No one knows anything
about God. Any concept that can be
formed of Him is incomplete and er
roneous. One concept of God is as
good as another.
Catholic.—God is free to impose
laws on men.’
.Masonic. —God is not free decree
laws. The laws of God are the forces
of nature.
Catholic.—God has manifested Him
self to the world; by reason and by
revelation. God’s revelation has been
made through His Prophets and Apos
tles and through His Son Jesus
Christ.
Masonic. —God manifests Himself
to the world by means of the uni
verse. Apart from that revelation
there is no other knowledge of Him.
Catholic.—Man has the obligation
of professing the religion which His
Creator wishes.
Masonic.—Man is free to profess
any religion (liberty of conscience.)
Catholic.—The Catholic is the only
true religion.
Masonic.—All religions are or may
be true. -There is no certainty on this
point.
Catholic.—Man’s soul is immortal,
and consequently will live for eterni
ty.
Masonic.—The soul of man can on
ly be said to be immortal as long as
it swallowed up by the Being
of God, of which it is an emanation.
Catholic.—After death there is an
eternal life of happiness for the good,
and an eternal hell for the wicked.
Masonic.—Masonry does not con
cern itself with what happens after
death.
Catholic.—Human laws are not
binding if they are opposed to»the di
vine law. ,
Masonic.—Human laws are binding
whenever they are passed by a ma
jority. They, are independent of the
divine laws.
Catholic.—The Supreme Lord of
the world is the God whom Catholics
recognize and adore.
Masonic.—The supreme being of
this sublunar world (since Masonry
does not concern itself with any
other) is humanity, or, in the con
crete, Man.
The preceding Masonic proposi
tions are taken from the works of
Albert Pike, which are, as it were,
the Bible of Masonry.
The above list could be indefinite
ly prolonged with propositions rela
tive to the private and public life of
individuals, from which the idea of
God is eliminated; relating also to
mortality, education, amusements,
matrimony, divorce, etc., in all of
which Masonry holds doctrines dia
metrically opposed to the Catholic
faith.
It being plainly impossible to be
.ieve contrary doctrines, it follows as
a consequence that it is impossible
to be at the same time a Catholic
and a Mason. -
From the pamphlet of Lucian John
stone we quote the following:
Attitude of Freemasonry Towards
Catholicism, Page 13.
“So much is always said about the
hostile attitude of the Catholic
Church against Freemasonry that it
may help to clear matters if we in
quire also into the attitude of Free
masonry towards Catholicism. It is
necessary to do this in order to en
lighten those well-meaning Masons
for whom this writing is chiefly in
tended. And right here let me state
that I am referring to the attitude
of the leading Masonic writers and
speakers of the official publications
of the craft. And lam sorry to say
to my Masonic personal friends that
Freemasonry, even here in America,
measured by such a standard is seen
to be bitterly and irreconcilably hos
tile towards the Catholic church.
Really, I say this with deep regret,
knowing what a shock it wjll be to
those many Mosahs who have the
highest regard for the Church, some
of whom are married to Catholics and
are rearing their children Catholics.
But, painful as it is to say so, it is the
truth that this hostility to the church
is practically universal among the
leading men and official organs of
Freemasonry, and it is a hostility
whiefc is bitter in the extreme.
Now I could give innumerable
quotations from the leading Masonic
writers and Masonic magazines. But
I will confine myself to two, because
of the prominence of their sources
and their frankness. The first is
from the famous Albert Pike, who,
both in America and Europe, is ac
claimed by Masons as their greatest
authority—the Prophet of Freema
sonry,’ the ‘Masonic Pope,’ to quote
their own expressions of reverence for
him. So that after he has spoken
it is practically unnecessary to go to
others for an opinion about Masonry.
Well, then, listen to Pike’s estimate
of Catholicism versus Freemasonry.
I quote from the Catholic Encyclo
pedia (783): ‘ln a long letter of De
cember 28, 1886, for instance, lie con
jures the Italian Grand Commander.
Timoteo Riboldi, 23 * * * the inti
mate friend of Garbaldi, to do all in
his power in order to unite Italian
Masonry against Vatican. He writes:
The Papacy * * * has been for
a thousand ‘years the torturer and
curse of humanity, the most shame
less imposture, in its pretense to
spiritual power of all ages. With its
robes wet and reeking with the blood
of half a million of human beings,
with the grateful odor of roasting
human flesh always in its nostrils, it
is exulting over the prospect of re
newed dominion. It has sent all over
the world it anathemas against con
stitutional government and the right
of men to freedom of thought and
conscience.’ Again: ‘ln the presence
of this. Cobra di Capello, this deadly
treacherous, murderous enemy, the
most formidable power in the world,
the unity of Italian Masonry is of ab
solute and supreme necessity/ etc.
Note that herein Pike expresses the
bitterest hatred of Catholicism along
with ardent sympathy with Italian
Masonry, which has always been the
bitterest foe of the Pope. Now, then,
after reading such words from the
greatest of all Masons, how can any
Mason still maintain that Masonry
is not opposed to Catholicism?
Against such an utterance from the
‘Masonic Pope/ is it not downright
childish to argue for the tolerance of
Masonry in regard to the Catholic
Church?”
This will give a satisfactory ans
wer to such as ask the question: Why
Is Masonry (or any Lodge for that
matter) forbidden by the Church?
The Church, as the /divinely institut
ed Teacher of Mankind, cannot permit
her children to join any organiza
tion which is hostile to her work.
COLORED MINISTER
DEFENDS THE KLAN
—K-K-K
Rev. J. C. Jackson Regrets That
That Organization Was Not
Formed at Earlier Date.
—K-K-K
Indianapolis/ Ind.—Declaring that
“if the Klan is wrong it will die,
and if it is right, it will live,” Rev.
J. C. Jackson, colored minister of the
Israel of God Church at 2330 Ar
senal avenue, delivered a sermon to
his congregation in which he dwelt
upon the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan.
“I have read, very closely,” said the
pastor, “and I have found nowhere
that the Klan has harmed colored
people. Therefore I can say nothing
against the organization any more
than I can about anyone else, until
I know that it has done Something
wrong.
“You have heard that the Klan is
against you, but I say to you, do not
let that worry you. One leading a
Christian life need never fear the
Klan. As the Klan stands for the
protection of womanhood, we colored
men should stand for the protection
of our womanhood.”
During his sermon, the pastor
presented parables in which he
showed that there should be no fear
of the Ku Klux Klan by the colored
people.
Has Right to Organize
“I believe,” he continued, “that the
Klan has as much right to organize
as any other body of persons just
so long a their laws do not inter
fere with the laws of our state and
nation. I truly believe that many
crimes have been committed in which
the criminals have thrown suspicion
on the Klan. Should the Klan or
any other organization commit
crimes they should be punished ac
cording to the law. My one regret
is that the Klan was not formed be
fore it was and stop race mixing.”
Rev. Jackson declared that many
crimes hqd been committed and laid
at the door of some negro who was
innocent and said that the attempt
to fasten crimes on the Ku Klux
Klan of which it was not guilty was
just as reprehensible as that of ac
cusing negroes of offenses they did
not commit.
“In conclusion,” said Rev.. Jack
son, “I wili say that it is the duty
of the church to pray for humanity,
and if the Ku Klux Klan motives
are not for the uplifting of fallen hu
manity the organization will not
stand. But, on the other hand, if
their motives are pure, it will go on
in spite of all that can be said about
it, and will accomplish its aims.”

The above disgusting statement
was placed in electric lights over the
theater in Houston, Tex., where Pola
Negri’s picture, “Bella Donna,” was
being shown. This picture is a direct
bid for inter-marriage between blacks
and whites and should be opposed by
fans all over the nation. “Bella
Donna”'is the story of a white wo
man who falls in love with a black
man, is despoiled by him and then
returns to give madly her love, only
in the end to be spurned while
swooning and pleading at his feet.
Bella Donna! Bella Donna plasters
are used by people when they are
sick and anyone who sees the picture
Bella Donna will certainly be sick.
Pola Negri is the woman who is sup
posed to be engaged to Charlie Chap
lin. Chaplin is the one who pokes

The CALL OF THE NORTH
THE KU KLUX KLAN IS
A VOICE IN PROTEST
A Exchange calls attention to an
important feature in the much de
sider explanation of the Ku Klux
growth. It is the following expression
from Hon, L. P. Bryant, United
States District Attorney who said in
an address at New Orleans:
“The Ku Klux Klan—composed in
large part of sincere, high thinking
men—is a symptom of the wide
discontent with the administration of
the criminal law in this country; which
in turn is caused by the large volume
of crime; which in turn is due to the
maudlin sympathy with which crim
inals are regarded, resulting in their
acquittal when a more absolute ad
ministration of justice would assure
their conviction.
“The percentage of crime is larger
in the United States than in any
other civilized country in the world,”
he said. “This is due partly to the
framing of laws themselves, partly to
the weak and flabby attitude of the
people toward the criminal, who have
followed to its most illogical end the
doctrine ‘better than 99 * guilty men
should escape than one innocent man
should suffer.’ The existance of such
organizations as the Ku Klux Klan
is a protest against such conditions.
Naturally, i do not think that the
Klan, or any who are not the consti
tuted authorities should take the ad
ministration of the law into their own
hands. However, the fact must be
faced. The Klan is an indictment of
the way criminal law is being en
forced.”
A STRICKENCONSIENCE
A stricken conscience characterizes
Christendom. A searching of the
conscience is going on. Everywhere
in Europe and America there is an ex
amination of the heart to find where
the fault is. This manifestation nat
urally fakes a morbid turn with many.
But it is found with the best intel
lects and most enlightened con
sciences. And the business Is not
only salutary, but also essential.
A revaluation is the process we are
all, consciously or unconsciously, en
gaged upon: This is an intellectual
as well as a spiritual and moral ef
fort. Perhaps in the business we are
in danger % of divorcing the intellect
from the moral nature. The latter,
experiencing shock and suffering re
pentance, would repudiate the former.
If suffered to do so, the consequence
might be disastrous certainly would
be detrimental, because mankind has
use and need far intellect now as per
haps never before in the history of
the race. Intelligence, morally orien
ted, is what is required. Moral in
spiration, unintelligently directed,
scarcely can suffice.
Dr. G. Stanley Hall, one time Presi
dent of Clark University, a foremost
American psychologist, in his Life
and Confessions, recently -published,
envisages this problem of the age,
sees it both through intellectual and
spiritual media. He writes: “The
waste of incompetency and the curse
of mediocrity are upon us. We have
utterly lost all power to discriminate
between the best men, things, ideas,
books, and the second or even the
tenth best.”
There, we believe, Dr. Hall puts his
finger upon what is the matter with
tts, especially us Americans, just now.
Our valuations are jumbled, effaced.
When a worthy Chicago great mer
chant can compare himself to the
great statesman, artist* inventor,
scientist, and claim fame as his pre
rogative, there is revealed the char
acter of our times—the inability to
discriminate between what is noble
and what is trivial, what is essential
and what is accidental. Our sense
of value has been effaced or seriously
impaired, and this is not only an in
tellectual error but a spiritual astig
matism. x .
L '
Dr. Hall, however, is hopeful. Our
today’s characteristic is a phase.
Promise in the future is justified. He
is not the blatant optimist that Wells
is. He is rather the conditional op
timist. But the conditions can be
fulfilled by those nations that are
properly resolved. He writes:
Education has thus now become the
chief of problem of the world, its
one holy cause. The nations that
see this will survive, and those that
fail to do so will slowly perish.
Knowledge must henceforth be the
light and guide of mankind. More
of it must be quarried from the origi
nal sources, nature and man. This,
together with the choicest lessons of
past experience, must be even
more widely diffused/and there must
be absolute freedom of both research
and teaching. There must be re-edu
cation of the soul and of the heart
as well as of the intellect, and tha
ideals of service must supplant those
of selfishness and greed. Nothing
else can save us, and I shall live and
hope to die when my time comes,
convinced that this goal is sot only
attainable, but that we are, on the
whole, with however many and wide
spread retrogressions,' making prog
ress surely if slowly and in the right
direction.
These are words of wisdom from
one of the wisest living Americans.
We commend them to all thoughtful
persons, to all responsible ones.—

MODERN EDUCATION
By WILLIAM J. WARNER, 82*
If, as the head of the Catholic Uni
versity at Washington, - D. C., says,
“Modern education and Catholic can
not live together,” then, sooner or
later, Catholic education must go;
and the sooner the better for this
great Republic. It must surely fol
low the inexorable law of the “sur
vival of the fittest,” and there can
be no question raised as to which
produces the better citizens of our
country. Therefore the public school
and modern education will surely sur
vive. ~
In this great Republic there can be
no combination of church and school
any more than there can be a combi
nation of church and state. The fu
ture of the state depends upon the
democratizing influence of the public
school. The need today of a Depart
ment of Education is far greater
than it was in 1867 when Senator
Charles Sumner made the declaration
that if he had his way there would
be such a department. In 1867 there
was no Catholic Welfare League with
its vicious propaganda against mod
ern education, its lobby to influence
legislation, and its control of politics
and schools in certain sections of the
country. If members of congress
would sit alone with their consciences,
the Towner-Sterling bill would quick
ly pass in such form as to be of last
ing benefit to the public school in
particular and modern education in
general. If our brethren in congress
would sit alone with their consciences,
they would pay less attention to prop
aganda against the public school.
If the present generation does not
settle the matter for all time, who
will “face the answer and question?”
Will not the “Ghost of forgotten ac
tions” be “an awful thing to face?”
Is the resent agitation against our
greatest institution but a “warning
of yesterday?” In this land, when
the years increase, will our descend
ants talk of our former living?
Will our children “cry out in the
future and no one come to save?”
Tfle future judgment will certainly
be dreadful unless we of this day “sit
alone with our consciences” and leave
our children an inheritance of an un
trammeled system of public educa
tion.
ROMANISM IN PRISONS
By S. A. PENFIELD
The Roman Catholic insistence that
public schools are filling the land with
criminals, while the parochial schools
of- Rome are making Christians and
law-abiding citizens, is strikingly
refuted by prison statistics in New
York State. Those statistics show
that the Roman Catholic population
of that State trained in parochial
schools furnishes nearly three times
as great a number of prison convicts
per capita as the Protestant popula
tion does.
The 1921 official prison report of
New York shows 4,286 convicts, of
whom 2,480 were Roman Catholics.
It thus appears that the parochial
schools of Rome train far more than
half of the convicts.
But even the latest and most ex
travagant claim of the Church of
Rome, as embodied in the Official
Catholic Directory for 1923, indicates
that far less than one-third of the
population of New York State are Ro
man Catholics. The United States
census for 1920 gaves the total popu
lation of the State as 10,394,000." The
Roman Catholic population, accord
ing to the Directory, is 3,265,927.
Of course.; the total population has
ncreased heavily since the census of
1920, but no later authentic figures
are Available. Using that census and
the figures of the Directory three
years later, we get the following re
sults:
Protestants in the state, 7,118,029;
in prison 1,866; per capita in prison,
1 to 3,814.
Roman Catholics in the'state, 3,266,-
972; in prison 2,420; per capita in pri
son, 1 to 1,349.
It thus appears that only one Pro
testant out of every 3,814 is in prison,
while one Roman Catholic out of
every 1,349 is incarcerated. With the
vast system of corruption and defeat
of justice carried on by the Roman
Catholic Tammany machine in New
York City and by like machines in
many other cities, it is practically
certain that more guilty Roman Ca
tholics than Protestants escape con
viction.
If full and even-handed justice was
uniformly meted out to all criminals,
the proportion of Roman Catholic
convicts would probably exceed three
to one. Such is the finished product
of the parochial schools and the papal
system. .
