most popular humoll rists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats niow enters successfiilly up
on the sixth yealr iof its.existenle:e, andll
has .become the e.ta ldished ihumorouslOt ailid
satirical paper of tihe country. It was
started and contilned the first year aIs it
montohlly, thei, to satisty the dhlemllnd of
the public, it was chaigrd to a fortnight.
Iy. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
thli political ~Iuld social shanias by its
masterly cartoons and liipungent edi torials,
it achieved even greater success thanl
before, and was recognized as thl ablest
and brightest of itselans. Since tlhen we
lhave yielded ,still further to the public
demand, anld now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
inlg the first successful weekly humorous
papler ever published in this country.
Aimiongi thie artists especially engaged

Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth. Hopkins,
Wales, Sholton, Wolf, Janip, Keettels,"
Stuckliardt, Day, Poland, and several
others. who arc yet known to fame.
In its literary departmlno ts Wild Oats
will, as it 'always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-clhass
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best humorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and sqrlibs
will bpsparllinlg, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will le first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can otiend the most fast
tidious.
