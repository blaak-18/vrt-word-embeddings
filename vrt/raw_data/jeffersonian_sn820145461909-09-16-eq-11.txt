OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
This is written on September 9th,
when we “make up” this department
for the paper which comes out on the
16th. We are always a week behind
the procession.
HOPES TO BE USEFUL.
My father takes The Jeffersonian,
and I like to read it very much, as
there is so much good reading in it.
I think everybody should read the
good old Jeffersonian. I long to see
the day come when the people will
cast their votes for the Hon. Thos.
E. Watson, and he will be elected
President of the United States. My
father is a farmer, and is 76 years
old. I have five brothers and three
sisters. My home is situated five
miles in the country. Above all, I
ope to be a useful and successful
woman, with a good character. lam
a little girl, 15 years old. I will close
with “best wishes.” —Lydie Pearl
Owens, R. F. D. 1, Ellaville, Ga.
A GOOD WORKER.
Enclosed you will find check for
five dollars, for which you will send
your paper to the following addresses.
Please send me, as a premium, “Na
poleon” and “Sketches from Roman
History.” I am a little boy, 12 years
old. I like your paper so well that I
want to get all of your books.—J. M.
Gaston, R. F. D. 4, Carrollton, Ga.
WORKING IN ARKANSAS.
Enclosed find money order for one
dollar, to pay for one year’s subscrip
tion to Watson’s Magazine, to be sent
to the name below; and send the
Watson knife to me. I am seven
years old, and named Willie Watson,
but I like Watson the best. Be sure
to send the knife. —Watson Buffing
ton, Texarkana, Ark.
(Why don’t some more of you boys
do the same? It’s a rattling good
knife, and you can’t beat it for whit
tling.)
A STORM IN TEXAS.
The storm of June 30th did not
hurt us much, but we were very
much frightened. The foundation
of our house was moved, and we left
it and went to an outhouse, and stay
ed there part of one day and one
night, while the storm was raging.
We had a family of five from Har
lingen visiting us at the time. About
three weeks afterwards the overflow
came and put a good season in the
ground for the crop which we are
now getting ready to plant. My
grandpa takes the two Jeffersonians,
and we all like Tom Watson and his
principles.—Your little friend, Julia
Carrie Adams, Harlingen, Texas.
SEVEN YEARS OLD.
My father takes The Jeffersonian,
and we all like it very much. I live
in the beautiful little town of Cairo,
the county seat of Grady County. I
have never been to school, but mam
ma teaches me at home. I will start
to school in September.—Guy Nich
olson, 7 years old, Cairo, Ga.
WHY NOT TRY NOW?
I have just finished reading The
Jeffersonian, and I think it the best
paper I ever read. My grandfather
subscribed for it, and received the
beautiful premium knife. I am a
lad of 15 years old, but have not
tried to win any of your prizes yet.—
Fred L. Camp, R. F. D. 2, Dublin, Ga.
THEM PICTURES!
My! but some of them are tough.
If I looked like that, I’d never for
give the stork that picked me out of
the bunch. Wonder if that bird is
living yet? Here’s one picture with
a dark chin beard, and a nice little
Gb* "Jeffersonian
curl at the top of his head. Another
with eyes like a potato’s, and an in
cipient mustache. Another was evi
dently copied from an early portrait
of Mr. Watson. One little girl cer
tainly must have sent a picture of
her sweetheart, by mistake; but he’s
a good looking boy, so I’ll forgive
her. Don’t know whether to feel
mad or complimented, and I wonder
what next week will bring forth.
OUIDA WRITES.
Papa takes the magazine, and my
uncle takes the paper. We live in
town in the fall and winter, and
camp out in the country in summer.
lam seven years old. Our school is
out. It will start again this month,
and I will be in the fourth grade.
Miss Mills will be my teacher.—
Ouida B. Yarbrough, Springvale,
Ga.
(Your writing and spelling are
good, much better than most of the
letters we get. Suppose you ask
Miss Mills, some day when she has
time to spare, the right way to use
“shall’ and “will.”)
ANOTHER LITTLE GEORGIA GIRL
Here comes a little Georgia girl to
join your happy band. My papa
takes the Jeffersonian, and I enjoy
reading it very much. I live in the
country, and would not live in town
for anything, unless I was compelled
to. My papa is a farmer, and raises
corn, cotton and oats. I help him
on the farm, and think it no dis
grace, either. For pets I have a
cat and a little baby brother, named
Farra Jackson. He is 16 months
old. I will draw Daddy Jim’s pic
ture, and I hope I will win a prize.—
Nellie Mae Leverette, Flovilla, Ga.
(Hope this picture won’t have to
be printed.)
JOLLYING HIM ALONG.
Dear Daddy Jim:—l believe this
picture is just like you. I drew it
myself. We can’t think of Daddy
Jim being an ugly man, even if he
wouldn’t print his picture.—Pauline
Persons, 9 years old, Monticello, Ga.,
R. F. D. 3.
(As a work of art, the picture is
good, and you must have taken
great pains to draw it. As a like
ness, it’s somewhere in the latitude of
the North Pole.)
QUITE UNEXPECTED.
I never saw you, but is this like
you? I hope so, for I want to win
a prize. I am a little girl, 13 years
old, and this is my first attempt.—
Lura Fields, R. F. D. 1, Flippen, Ga.
(This is quite unexpected, as Mr.
Bryan would have said, if he had
been elected. It’s a picture of a
young fellow, rather good looking.)
A NEW-COMER.
I have been seeing so many bright
and intelligent letters from boys and
girls of the United States, so I will
let you hear from a Georgia boy.
I am twelve years old, and live four
miles from Barnesville. We live close
to a big creek. I like to go fishing
and bathing. I have a fine peanut
patch, and will make at least ten

LIKES TO GO TO SCHOOL.
As I have not seen any letters
from the town of Cairo, I thought I
would write. Papa takes both the
weekly and monthly Jeffersonian and
thinks they are fine. I like to read
them, too, especially the letters from
the little boys and girls. Our school
will begin next Monday. I like to
go to school. lam 13 years old, and
am in the sixth grade. I have four
sisters and one brother. Two of my
sisters are married. My pets are a
cat, a calf and a doll. If this is
printed I will come again.—Bertha
Bloodworth, Cairo, Ga.
’WAY DOWN IN DIXIE.
I am a little girl 9 years old. My
papa is a subscriber to both the Jef
fersonians, and I enjoy reading
the little folk’s letters. We live in
Dixie, and my papa carries the mail,
R. F. D. No 1, from this office. I
have two little sisters, Lois and Em
ily, and one little brother, Maurice,
all younger than I am. Mr. Watson
knows my grandfathers personally.
They are Mr. M. F. Simpson and Mr.
G. B. Crane.—Gladys Crane, Dixie,
Ga.
FROM SOUTH GEORGIA.
I am a South Georgia girl, 15
years old; brown eyes, fair complex
ion, auburn hair. I am just getting
well from a spell of paracitus, and I
am thankful that the Lord saved my
life, and raised me up so many good
friends. My papa takes the Jeffer
sonian and magazine, and I like to
read them both. As it is customary
to tell stories, I will tell one. Once
there was a little boy, five years old.
He was looking at a picture of a
little girl saying her prayers. After
looking at it a while, he slapped her,
and said: “Get up from there, you
know you have said Amen.”—Mary
L. Patrick, Tifton, Ga.
(There is a common mistake made
by many of the young folks in writ
ing, and that is the carrying over of
one or two letters of a word to the
next line. For instance: If “look
ing happens to be the last word in
a line, and the writer has room for
only lookin’’, the “g” will some
times be carried over to the follow
ing line. Words should be divided,
as far as possible, according to their
derivation; and always in syllables.
“Look-” on one line, and “ing” on
the next line, is right. Words of
one syllable cannot be divided at
all.)
When writing to advertisers, al
ways mention The Jeffersonian.
