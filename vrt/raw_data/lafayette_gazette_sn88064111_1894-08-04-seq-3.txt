to trace a public road from P. A.

The New Jury Law.
It is probable that the jury re
cently drawn by the jury commis
sioners for the October term of
court will not be legal under the
present law, as it is believed that
its promulgation binds the coming
session of the court. Under the
law the jury commission is formed
of five members appointed by the
district, three of whom constitute
a quorum. They first select twenty
four names from the voting popula
tion of the parish, these names are
placed in an invelope and sealed
and on the back they write "'Grand
Jury," they then select thirty names
in the same way and place them in
a sealed invelope and upon that
write "Petit Jury." A list of both
must be furnished the Sheriff within
fifteen days before the term of Court,
so that the persons so selected can
be regularly notified. From the
envelope marked "Grand Jury" the
sixteen names are dr.own and they
form the other envelope; the petit
jury is selected as it is needed during
the trial of cases. The present law
dispenses with the publication of the
jury list and greatly shorten tinrie
for the selection of the venire.
The exemptions from jury duty
are about the same as in the old
law; the age is sixty years and ser
vice on a prior jury is the same.
The new law is thought to be an im
provement on the old one and it is
hoped that the test next October
will prove the wisdom of the law
makers in its enactment.
