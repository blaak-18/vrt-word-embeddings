PAGE SIX
DON’T LEAVE OUT THE MISSIS
SIPPIAN.
Dear Sir: —I wish a few words to
to be put in the grandest paper now
published, the Jeffersonian Weekly
or the Magazine, I don’t care which.
They are both good enough for any
preacher to read.
What I want to say is this, I con
gratulate Mr. A Page, of Venus,
Miss., for his suggestion for a plat
form for the reform people, one that
we can all stand on without so much
mumbling and growling. Mr. Page
has picked these men to do the
work: Messrs. Watson, Debs, Mitch
ell, Gompers, Hearst, Barker and
LaFollette. Mr. Page forgot, I
reckon, that we have a Mississippian
by the name of Jas. K. Yardman.
We sure want him in the crowd too.
I am yours for the reform cause,
W. F. FLYNT.
Laurel, Miss., Rt. 3.
WHAT IS A DEMOCRAT, ANY
WAY?
The Jeffersonian reached me three
days late the past week, probably
due to the strike at your place.
I have just noticed the article un
der the head-lines, “A Senatorial
Black-list,” and I will quote a part
of it where you say: “If the Demo
cratic platform was not framed for
that purpose, what was it made for?
If it was not meant to bind Demo
crats in office, who was it to bind?
Either it was put forth as the party’s
official and formal pledge of what
Democrats would do if the people
gave them the chance, or it was
framed for the deliberate purpose of
deceiving the voters. Which was
it?’’
Well, here is what Mr. Henry Wat
terson said in the daily Courier-
Journal, of Louisville, Ky., on the
25th of July, 1908, on the above
subject: “In this campaign the two
platforms (meaning the Dems, and
Reps.) read much alike. Each was
made to harmonize conflicting ele
ments and catch votes. Neither is
worth the paper it is written on.’’
Watterson knew that the platforms
were deceptive and only intended for
vote catchers. This was when he and
Mr. Bryan were harmonizing with
the negroes, Parkerites, etc. When
I would refer to this statement of
Watterson the Democrats would re
pudiate him and say that Watterson
would say or do anything, but he
was cutting close to the truth in that
statement, and the following of
such leaders has got the Democratic
party in the same fix that the Hon.
Cobb, of Alabama, was in; they are
lost, and don’t know where they are
at.
Now listen to this editorial of the
Tampa Tribune, of June 14th, on
“A State Convention”:
“So much uncertainty prevails as
to the correct answer to the question
‘What is a Democrat?’ in Florida
that the suggestion of a State Demo
cratic Convention for the purpose of
defining a platform of princples for
the conduct of the party and its offi
cial representatives, is by no means a
bad one. At the recent session of the
Legislature Democracy was but an
empty name, and although the two
houses were nominally composed al-
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
together of Democrats, the proceed
ings of the session demonstrated that
practically every shade of party be
lief was represented among the legis
lators and that the varieties of Dem
ocrats were too numerous to be suc
cessfully catalogued. As a matter of
fact, much of the tune of the session
was the rankest Populism, Socialism
or nothingism, and disgraced the
name of Democracy by its presence
under the Democratic banner and its
authorization by Democratic votes.”
Lost! Lost! Lost! Six million
people voted a Democratic ticket, and
it seems that no one has been able to
give a satisfactory answer as to
what a Democrat is. And now call
a cor vention to determine what kind
of niai’:, or brand, or grip that you
may know them.
Respectfully,
S. J. CROW.

WOULD CALL CONFERENCE IN
ATLANTA IN JULY.
To the Weekly Jeffersonian:—l
have for some time been contemplat
ing writing you my views relative to
a conference on State and national
economic questions.
Suppose we call a conference some
time in July to meet in Atlanta and
ask all reformers, irrespective of
past party affiliations, to meet us in
this conference and adopt a platform
of principles that is truly Democratic
after the idea of Jefferson and see to
it that no man is elected to Congress
that does not stand for these princi
ples. The late war could have been
avoided if it had not been for a di
vided Democracy. A divided Demo
cracy can not accomplish anything.
A reunited Democracy along the
lines of Jefferson, combined with
20th century financial views, can
hold the balance of power in Con
gress and secure such national legis
lation as the laboring masses de
mand and should have under a free
republic.
True democracy of deeds has the
power, as well as the intelligence, to
regulate all phantoms, ghosts and the
‘‘niggers in the wood-pile” and elect
men in sympathy with progressive
reform measures. The masses and
agricultural classes are better edu
cated than ever before in American
history on economic questions and
like their leader, Mr. C. S. Barrett,
suggests in an article which appear
ed in Uncle Remus’ Magazine May,
1909, “On Political Tolerance,” “The
South is ready to quit looking
through a knot-hole politically.”
Let all the schools of Democracy
quit browbeating one another over
twedledee and twedledum and stand
for measures that will command the
respect of the intelligent people of
the South, the North and the West.
So let the slogan be on to Atlanta
to re-establish the principle of true
Democracy as advocated by our fore
fathers and reunited Democracy re
gardless of his creed or his former
political affiliations.

MAKES THE SPARKS FLY.
The Jeffersonian received today. I
had hoped to get back numbers for
3effersoniaft
April and May, but I suppose you
could not furnish them.
I am greatly interested in your
editorials on Foreign Missions. I do
not think I am given to flattery, but
1 must say that I think you are the
right man to make “the sparks fly”
by your sledgehammer blows.
I have ail the while been one of
your ardent admirers in politics, and
now you are making such headway
from your standpoint and your
searchlight is opening the eyes of
some people that have been blinded
by the god of missions.
I bid you God-speed in your great
work. I have been impressed for
quite a while that the great God of
all creation has fitted, prepared and
given not only a gift, but gifts to you
that you can and will wield a flaming
sword over the heads of all fanatics
concerning this question, and that
while we may differ in some things,
in the main we are together.
Christ commissioned His disciples to
go preach and sent them himself,
and never at any time delegated it
to any Church, Synod, Assembly or
board or convention of men.
And one more point and I will
close this letter, for I know you are
a very busy man. It is unscriptural
for us to say that it is the duty of
any country, settlement or commu
nity to support the Gospel anywhere
except at home. This, I believe, is
your contention. I would write more,
but I know your time is precious and
your hand is to the plow. The fur
row is straight so far, but don’t ever
look back; but Christ, the captain of
your salvation, is in front leading
you and may you by His grace suc
ceed in the face of all opposition is
the prayer of this unworthy scribe.

BRIMFULL OF INTERESTING IN
FORMATION.
I have just finished reading your
weekly of June 10th and find it brim
full of the most interesting informa
tion that could be published.
The figures you offer to prove your
contention with reference to the
tariff on Southern commodities are
convincing and ought to be furnish
ed to every farmers’ organization in
the country, and every other honest
voter. And, by the way, your Maga
zine is the finest thing—in its line—
I ever saw.
Keep “pumpin’ ” into ’em, and
some day you will be recognized by
every honest person as one of the
greatest men that ever lived.
I am sending money order for $2.
Please enter my subscription to both
of the “Jeffs,” and you might send
me the knife and shears.
Tom Watson Owens will be one
year old next month, and he is red
headed sure.
Believe me your well wisher,
J. P. OWENS.
Lindale, Texas.
A LONESOME POPULIST.
Please find enclosed $2, for which
extend my time on both Jeffersonians.
Be sure and send June number of
the Magazine, I do not want to miss
that.
I am one who wore the blue, and
an old-time Greenbacker and un
compromising Populist. I fought
fusion from the first to the last. I
am now just at my seventy-second
mile-post and getting quite feeble
and cannot do much, but feel that I
must keep informed on what is going
on. It is very encouraging to me to
see men of your talent and qualifica
tions taking a firm stand for the right
and fighting the battles of the poor
and downtrodden.
I am the only Populist in this sec
tion, perhaps the only one in the
county, but I cast my vote with pride.
I have never been in the habit of
accepting premiums from my friends,
but would like very much to have one
of your premium knives, if I am en
titled to it, to show to my Demo-Re
publicratic friends.
May your life, your health, and
your prosperity, be prolonged to you
for the good of humanity, is the
prayer of your friend and well wisher,
J. R. CHASE.
Seneca, Newton County, Mo.
Now, before it is too late, send us
a dollar for your subscription and get
either a Watson knife or our self
sharpening shears free. Send us two
dollars for both Jeffersonians, and
get both premiums.
Free to all —15 magnificent Sou
venir Post-cards. Read the adver
tisement and send us 30 cents for a
3-months’ subscription to the Jeffer
sonian.
IS IT RIGHT?
I heartily commend your article
in the June edition of the Jefferso
nian Magazine on “Foreign Mis
sions.” lam so thoroughly nauseat
ed with that phase of religion that I
do not know but what I am border
ing on skepticism.
I will tell you of a few incidents
that have come under my own per
sonal observation. I have made a
number of visits to the schools of
this county, of both races. I have
seen with my own eyes white chil
dren going to school in the dead of
winter, who had to walk three and a
half and four miles barefooted. In
one case I was inside of a school
building trying to keep warm, and I
saw a number of children (belong
ing to a family of eight or nine) who,
when called up to class to recite, were
not ready with a good lesson because
they did not have any books to study
out of. Their parents were honest,
hard working people, but too poor to
buy books. Foreign Missions?
I was a member' of a congregation
in the Methodist church here one
Sunday, not long ago, and they kept
us there until half-past one (though
service is usually over by twelve
o’clock), because they were raising a
great “hullabaloo” over a “God
sent opportunity” they had present in
tne shape of two Japanese boys. Peo
ple shed tears over them, a goodly
sum was raised; arms were thrown
around them. Now they have diplo
mas of Emory College. There was
