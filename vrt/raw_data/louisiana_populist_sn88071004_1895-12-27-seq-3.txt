has eiven spllenldid entertainmecnts

were not large, hut the fact that
Christiuma and its festivities was
against them, shows that the actors
were drawing cartIs. The tenthusi

this Company to visit this city on
a more favorab)le occLe5ion.

Chrlstlma Trees.
Several "Christmas Trees" in
our city was one way Santa Claus
had of remembering the young
folks and babies. " The only ones
we could get particulars from was
the nice little affair at Mr. Tan
ner's on Monday evening, where
the families of Messrs. Tanner and
Holston and a few others enjoyed
themselves to a late hour with
Santa, some games anal plays.
Then at the Pythian Hall on Tues
day evening the Sunday School
children and their friends had a
beautiful tree well laden with pres
ents, which were handed tronnd by
clever Mr. Ubanks, as Santa Clause,
and his ushers. This was indeed
a thing of beauty, and quite a
success as a fun-maker, and a hap
piness-promoter.

S.::ernfr-g the Democratic
Party.
Inmprovement and progress are
impos.sile under Foster, the halt'er
and the fraud.
Fraud vitiates everything and
counterfeit tickets are the wor'st of
'frauds.
True Democrats will not vote
for any neii unl s he run o:i aI
I )1emne'ra:iic diatform.
There are too many old soldiers
in the anti-Foster ranks for them
to shew tlhc white feather.
The rule or ruin policy of (;or
man destroyed the palrty in Mary
land. The rule or ruin policy of
the Fosterites is worse than that
of Gorman.
The Fosterite braggarts should
roe:ielmber that text of scripture
which says : ''Pride goeth before
destruction and a haughty spirit
before a fall."
Mr. Foster has been asked to
remove the register of voters in
St. Landry lpurish for refusal to
registe.r voters. Let's see what
will be done in this case.
Even while the law and order
p)rttenders were in session at the
Tahernuacle they were concocting
all sorts of tricks and frauds to
delude and trap t!,e people.
The preachers of New Orleans
have opened their batteries against
the dreadful cc-spool of corrup
tion which M]url;hy J. Fotcer is
supporting. Before the Ides of
April every pulpit iln the State
will ring with denunciation. of the
bosses and boodlers.
The anti-lottery movement was
a reform movement which did not
reform.
We have never heard so many
good men say they are di-.gusted
with politics.
The most awful result of immor
ality in a high official is the con
tamination of young men.
The boys of our State Universi
ty should be protected from con
tact with moral impurity at all e
hazards.
If we were mistaken in Foster
four years ago, is it not right and
consistent for us to acknowledge it
and try to undo the wrong we did l
The men who claim to be politi
cal saints in this parish will have
sore consciences the rest of their
lives on account of the frauds they
attempted to practice last Thursday.
The Demo: rats of Richlandml par
ish sent a solid anti-Foster delega
tion to : hreveport. They ale in
an overwheming majority and pro- º
pose to maintain their rights.
Some of the boys were trying to
mnd out from Captain Blanks who
would be his deputy in case be
should be elected treasurer. Of
course he could not run the office
himself.
It has been conceded by the
Shreveport press that the primary
election held on Tuesday, Decem
ber 10, is the rankest on record.
Fortunately, the Caucasian is not
the only "kicker" which has de
clared that in the future primaries

tion of voters and by rules which I
will bar the-hobo and his kin from
the exercise bof the great privilege 1

quarter or halt a dollar.
On our way to CalUoun last Mon- I
day; we met many of the best citi
sens ia this parish who said they
would no participate in the pri
mary. Men like S. N. OCamp,
Travis MoClendon and G. W. Bol

are the pride and the glory of our
free institutions and we deeply
and bitterly regretted that they

or Iy refusal to vote, and the con
test bet ween a consolidlated active
opposing political noveminnt andl
the democratic organization as it
at present exists will be one of ex

condition of affairs bodes no good
to the democratic party and threat

in North Carolina, Maryland, Ken

tal Item.
J lion. D. M. Sholars, of O.ia
chita, opposed the nomination of
Mr. Foster in the following brief
but forcible speech :
"Mr. President and Gentlemen
of the Convention : As the con
vention refused to order a call of
the roll of parishes on the motion
to nominate for re-election Gov
ernor Foster by acclamation, and
as Col. Boatner has spoken on this
question of his nomination for him
self and those of the delegates from
Ouachita whom he represents, I
desire at this time to be heard a
moment in my own behalf.
"The perpetuities of the demo
cratic party, the peace and welfare
of the state and the honor and in
tegrity of the people, demand the
early passage of an honest election
law.
"The people believe in antd favor
the free coinage of silver and they
have not supported nor are they
now supporting for governor of
Louisia, the candidacy of any man,
whose record does not show him to
be in line with these demands of
the people.
"The business interests of New
Orleans and the honor and well
being of the inhabitants of that
city, as shown by the press and the
recordsof the courts, call loudly
for the suppression of the munici
pal spoliation which now carries
that city and for the establishment
there of a pure and honest city
government.
"For the highest office within'
her gift, the state of Louisiana
sorely needs, and the welfare of hkr I
people requires, a man who will
owe his elevation to the exalted
position of governor of the state
to a free and untrammelled expree
sion of the will of the people in a
fair and honest election.
"The circumstances under which
a majority of the delegoates were
elected to this convention, the sur
roundings and environments inci
dent to its organization, and the
nomination of a candidate for gov
ernor in advance of the adoltion
of a party platform, are a prosti
tution of the name of democracy
to an unseemly scramble for office
in which questions of grave im
portance to the people are ignored.
"This convention, as I view it,
represents neither the honor of the
.rentl mten of tl, ' , *m 'ntion, lit

have learned it, for tllhe honor, thI,

The Jingo war spirit is cooling

battles, on sea and land. on pialper.
If Cleveland were to give half as
much attention to maintaining the
credit of tlhe nation, on the basis
of gold and silver, as he is per
sistent in his demands for gold
bonds, the gold reserve would be
I)rotected from the rapacious greed
of the money sharks, directed by
the Rothschil'd's influence in dis
crediting the financial standing of
the United States. Unfortunately
Cleveland is a goldbud, and will
see no relief or improvement ex
cept through the medium of gold,
which is controlled by England.
Caucasian.
The Washington Sentinel, Demo
crat, says :
President Cleveland either means
war in the contingency which he
has foreshadowed or he does not.
If he does not he is playing with
fire. If he does, he has assumed
the gravest responsibility for the
slightest cause of any president
that the country has eer had. iHe
has invoked either a storm of
war or a stormn of ridicule.
