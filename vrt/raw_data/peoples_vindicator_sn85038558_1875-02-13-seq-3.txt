lie is therefoe, at full liberty to fl
low the spirit and not the strict let- ii
ter of Waslington's example. Ham
ilton asked Washington to "obey the C
voice of your country" when he first i
contemplated retirement; hitt Grant h
would "obey the voice of his en,- , i
try by a speedy resignation Wash- it
iug was told that "if a solitary e
ote or two should be wanting to
p om unanimity the fewness of ex
epfias will bhe a confirmation of
the devotion of the commnnity." In
the case of His Excellency, "the few
ness of the exceptions" would be on n
the other side. If His Excellency is ti
teally eulouslof Washington's great o
fame he is quite free to follow his b
magnanislns impulses unrestrained t,
by the wishes of a protesting country. I
It may be said, indeed, that the ques- y
tion which held Washington ws long II
in hesitating perplexity was whether j
he would consent to a second, term
against his inclination, not whether
he would resign in the midst of it.
Bat if the country had desired his
resignation they would have been
promptly gratified. Hamilton said t
to him in the letter from which we
have already quoted, "I think it will
be more eligible to retire from office
before the expiration of a .term of
election than to decline a re-election."
There can be no doubt that Washing- !
te would have so retired in the midst
of his sgeond term if he had not felt
assured that he would thereby have
crossed the unanimous wish of the
country. His Excellency may fairly u
be excused from any similar feelings tI
of delicacy as to wounding the love
and trust and thwarting the wishes J
of his fellow citizens.
He has an opportunity to complete
the parallel between himself and F
washington by snrrending the extra
hundred thousand dollars which fell
to him by the infamous salary grab.
Washington refused any pay for his
services either as the commander of
our armies or as President beyond
the reimbursement of his expenses.
If His Excellency resigns on the 4th
of March he will approach nearly
enough to this feature of his great
model. By that date he will have
received the pay of two full terms at
the rWte which would have continued
but taor the salary grab, and the
country will not grumble at paying
him four years' salary for two years' (
services, if he chooses to deviate so
far from Washington's example as to
take it. Even if he should think the
additionallmundred thousand dollars
which comes to him by the salary
grab too great a sacrifice the
people will not object to making it
up to him by a pension for life. A i
republican Congress offered this in
ducemet a few years agvto the de
mocratie Judges of the Supreme
Court, and it might be willing to ease
His Excellency's resignation by a
similar act of liberality, if he is wil -
liag to accept it. But he would bet
ter consult his fame by a closer imi
tation of the first President. The
fact that we measure 1"s disinteret
edness, patriotism ,and magnanimity
by so exalted a standard and make it
the fonundation, if not exactly of ex
pectations, at least of hopes and sug
gestions, is probably the highest com
pliment ever paid to His Excellency's
cbaracter.-N. Y7, Berakt
"What," asks a correspondent, "is
'fir Marmaduke's Musings,' to which
Moolton so often refers in his testimo
ny at the Reecher-Tilton trial 1" It
is a poem written some time ago by
Theodore Tilton, and runs, if our
memory serves us, thus:
I won a noble name-
Hlaving lit out for fame
Under Henry Ward's regime
And Ihope that the shme,
As a kind of Beacon-flame,
WouldM guide me through all shame
And every sort of blame;
But'the Reverend spoiler came,
And I wish I may be dashed
If that resplendent name
4r allmy hoarded fame
we.ren't into kindling smashed !
Or words to that effeet.-[Couarier

"Deatl loves a lsing Mark."
No more truthful illustration of this
aying could be afforded than by the
laking away of the good, true anad noble
Paur, whose untimely death, just as he
. had crossed the threshold of mature man
hood and entered upon .a life of useful
oess and hbnor, his kindred and friends
are called upon to lament. Frank, gen
lons and chivalrous he wis respected
sd esteemed by all who knew him;
tad, gentle and loving, the affections of
the ,loved ones at honie' were closely
4ptwined around his heart, and this
bereavement bows them to the very
earth with sorrow and grief.

A, Kentucky editor settles the Lou
isiana matter as follows :
"Phil Sheridan is the only man in
Christendom whom we would be de
lighted to skin. Not that we would
have any special use for his greasy
hide, but only for fun ; just out of
idle ceriosity to see how he would
enjoy the thing as a foretaste of what
inevitably awaits himi with hungry
jaws as his final doom."
--.-.-.O
A Vermont schoolmaster says lie
never felt unequal to any demand in
the line of his profession, excepting
on one occasion, when a f~armter
brought his tifteen year old daughter
to the school, and, walking up to the
mnster's desk, said: "'That's my
youngest gal, and if you ever catch
her slidin' down hill with the boys, I
just want you to trounce her."
We have a little political conun
drum to propose. It is this: It takes
two-thirds of the House of Repre
sentatives to suspend the rules of that
body. How, then, cau new rules be
adopted that not only suslpend but
repeal the old ones by a majority vote 7
It is funny, isn't it, that it should
take two-thirds to temporarily set
aside a rule, but a majority can set it
aside altogether. This is what Speak
er Blaine says can be done, but just
how and by what phlosophy hle did
not explain. We think it moust be
lupon Butler's ground of a political
necessity. Upon the same ground
they could chop off any man's head
who is agiiinst the party, without
judge or jury.-Cincinnati Enquirer.

Said mule is a light Bay, or Sorrel
horse mule; is about fifteen hands and
three inches high ; six years old, rather
light bodied; walks long and holds a
high head. Has no brands, but I think
has a small wen or lump about his pose.
It is believed he was taken by a Freed

"HIIankins," and traded for a large sway
backed Red Roan horse, near Campte,

WEEKLY AND DAILY FOR 1875
The approach of the Presidential elec- tit
tion gives unusual importance to the Pe
events and developments of 1875. We of
shall eideavor to describe them fully, I
faithfully, and fearlessly. tnl
THE WEEKLY SUN has now attain- Al
ed a circulation of over seventy thou- I
sand copies. Its readers are found in va
every State and Territory, and its quali- nin
ty is well known to the public. We !l
shall not only endeavor to keep it fully j1e
up to the old standard, but to improve ct
ad add to its. variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to ce
be a thorough newspaper. All the news II
of the day will bhe folund in it, condens- c.h
ed when unimportant, at fall length ''
when of moment, and always, we trust, ti
treated in a clear, interesting and in
structive manner.
It is oar aint to make the Weekly Sun be
the best family newspaper in the world.
It will be full oft entertaining and ap- m
propriate reading of every sort, but will
ronst nothing to offend the most scrnpn
ons andtl delicate taste. It will always it
contain the most interesting stories and le
romances of the day, carefully selected 1e
and legibly printed.
The Agricultural Department is a o0
prominent feature in the Weekly Sun, W
and its articles will always be found A
fresh and useful to the farmer. p1
The number of men independent in at
polities is increasing, and the Weekly 81
Sun is their paper especially. It belongs st
to no party, and obeys no dictation, con
tending for principle, and for the election an
of the best men. It exposes the corrup
tion that disgraces the country and s'
threatens the overthrow of republican a
institutions. It has no fear of knaves, p
and seeks no favors fromn their support- t
ere.
The markets of every kind and the p
fashions are regularly reported in its
colu mus.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one i
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
and fifty-six columns. As this barely P
pays expenses of plaper and printing, we
are not able to moake any discount or al- I
low any premium to friends who may
make pecial efforts to extend its circula
tion. IUnder the new law, which re
quires payment of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty cents the
't cost of prepaid postate added, is the rate
nof subscription. It is not necessary to a
get up a club in order to have the WVeek- *
ly Sun at this rate. Any oet who sends
one dollar and twenty eents will get the
paper, post.paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.-Eiglst pages, r

lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday Evening Post has been the
GREAT LITERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, and has ever borne a
widespread and unblemishled reputation
Sfor the unsurpassed purity, refinement
st and excellence of the Serials, Sketches
and Milscellaneous reading matter.
It is pre-emninently
The Best Family Paper
.that is published in this eountry, from its
• never containing anything that would
Soffend the feelings of any one, either in
d a religious or political sense, or that
at could not be read at any fireside without
is obetion from the st fastidious.
i- b The circulation t the Saturday Even
o ing Post, through not quite so large
perhps, as its younger contemporaries,
as not, like that of some of them, fluctu
ating, and too often short-lived, but
SURE, SOLID ANID 8UBSTANTIAL,
- based upon the intrinsic merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on any ex
traneous influences, snch as the populari
Sno ty of individual writers, &e.
Good, however, as the Saturday Even.
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in tihe
future, and with this object in view we
ht will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our amssistance writers of admitted
rk. ability and known reputation.
By increasing its former attractions,
Sani addiung many judicimous and pleas
-.ig novelties, by studying how to please'
and cultivate the popular taste, by in
n- creasing industry anud enterprise, and by
_b enlarged facilities, we hope to make new
s. friends with each arid every issue, and
gbt eontinue to maintain the claim of the
ter Saturday Evening Post to its title of Tun.:

Natio:ln!, feature rof THIE ILDINE
mullst be ta:kenl inll lo narrow ,;tilse. True
art is cosmol;.olitan. While THIE AL
DINE is a strictly Amnerican institu:tion,
it does ilot contine itself entirely to tho
reproduction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad anll appreciative
art taste, olte thait will discriuillltec only
on gronllds of intrinsic lt2rit. Thus,
while placing belfore. the patroniso TIlE
ALDINE. as a leading charactcritic, the
productions of the most noted Atlericnu
artists, attention will 'always be given to
specimlens from foreign masters, giving
subscribers all the pleasure and i strl.;
tion obtainable from hlolle or forcign
sources.
The artistic illustration of Ameriemn
scenery, original with TIE AL)INE, is
an important feature. and its ilgniltgicclnt
plates are of a size more appropriate to
the satisfaetory treatmnent of detai's
thall can be aflorded by any inferior
page. The judicious interspersion of
landscape, nlarine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the scope of the w'o'."
confines the artist too closely to a single,
style of subject. The literature of THE
ALDINE is a light :and graceful accom
panimaent, worthy of the artistic fea
tires, with only such technical disqrisi
tions.as do not interfere with the popu
lar interest'of the work.
Preaminum for 1875.
Every sunbscriber for 187i will receive
a beautiful portrait, in oil colors, of the
same noble dog whose picture in a for
mer issue attracted so lunch attention,
"'MAN'S UNSELFISH FRIENID"
will be a welcome in every home. Eve
rybody loves such a dog, and the portrait
is executed so trie to the life, that it
seems the veritable presence of the ,a!i
mial itelf. The Rev. T. D)e Witt T'al
mage tells trhat his owi Newlbouindlaud
dog (the finest in Brooklyn, ibarks at it I
Although so natural, no oles who sees
this premium chromo will have the
slightest fear of being bitten.
