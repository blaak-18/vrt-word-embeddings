The State Relief,; or Millsaps,
Committee has decided to invest
the balance of the State donation
of $65.000 in freights, so that the
drouth sufferers can secure corn at
Western prices on which to feed
their stock and bread themselves
to make another crop.
An exception will be made in
the case of Winn and Grant, where
their portion of said fund will be
invested in purchase of corn to be
given to their sufferers.
The action of the State Commit
tee is an indorsement of the plan
of relief adopted by the Freeman
committee in this parish, and is by
far the most effective method ex
cept in cases of the most extreme
destitution which must and will be
provided for by private charity.
Mr. Freeman has ordered up to
date 40 car loads of corn, about
24.000 .bushels. He has received
bills of lading on one or two of
the iffit orders, and hopes to have
some of the corn in for distribu
tion in about a week.
New ORLEAMs, Jan. 24, 1897.
Hion. H. L. Brian, Chairman State
Central Committee:
All the rest of the six congres
Fional'districts having, been heard
from by "freight," I wish to an
awr for one of the many congres
slonal districts that fail to respond
to the Populist roll call when the
sm ake of the battle has cleared
sway.
It may be a clue by which the
missing millions of honest voters
can be saved.
The Weaver campaign was a
dose of Republican fusion that
aerly killed the People's party in
the Second district. •
All that could be done in my
power1 and that of a few others to
resmusetate the patient, pulminated
in a Labor movement in '94.
Wthb renewed effort in the State
. patign, we were again discon
eai'rtne and demoralizecd by Repub
liean rfuseion on a plan that intend
ed the booming of the Populist
tic ket in North L ouisiana, -and the
)p lealn ticket in South Lou

Gen. Win. J. Behan of Iber
ville, was in our city Tuesday, at
tending the meeting of stockhold
ers and ofHcers of the N. anul R.
R. V. Railwayv, in which he is a
large stockholder and Vice Presi
(lent of the company.
Gen. Behan ,as other large lrop
erty interests in our parish, ant is
well and favorably known to iuany
of our people.
Anent his visit here, we notice
in a number of papers the strong
advocacy of his appointment to
the important position of Collect
or of Customs at New Orleans, by
the incoming administration.
Because of his business identifi
cation with this parish and city,
because of his wide experience in
filling offices of great bo'nor and
trust, because of his personal worth
and geniality, and because of his
original and unswerving friend
ship for and support of McKinley
for President, we would be highly
pleased with his appointment, and
believe it would redlo:r.d to the
advantage and honor alike of the
State and the McKinley. adminis
tration.
While weare not a Republican,
we have been with them in a State
fight, whicih was one of the hardest
fought, most honorably conducted
and most fairly won of any cam
paign ever waged in Louisiana.
In this fight, Gcen. Behan was one
of tne foremost leaders, remain
ing at the front until the crown
ing act of infamy was perpetrated
at Baton Rouge last Spring, while
other so-called Republicans, who
now aspire to the same position as
the General, were buried in obliv
ion and inactivity in INew Orleans.
But the man who beats Gen. lie
han will "get up before day," and
we wish him a long continuance
his useful and honorable life.
Among the recent visitors to the
city was Judge J. E. Breda of
Natchitoches. Judge Breda is a
gentleman who commands the re
spect of all who have the pleasure
of his acquaintance. Of strict
principles, great bravery and un
tiring energy, he is a valuable
citizen. Judge Breda was accom
panied by his two young sons.
The three left for home yester
day.--Daily Item,
