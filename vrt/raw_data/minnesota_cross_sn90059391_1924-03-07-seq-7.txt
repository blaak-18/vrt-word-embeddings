OWER OF FIVE
MILLION VOTES
■ IS TREMENDOUS
Continued from page 6
cities where their main strength lies
the bulk of the vote is alien, Jewish
■or Catholic—and naturally anti-
Klan. It is worth a smile in passing
to note that most of the Klan leaders
and probably a slight majority ot
their followers, are democrats.
This rallying of alien elements has
keen the means of defeating nativis
tic movements several times since
Jefferson first did it just after 1800.
The democratic party did it in the
forties, and again in the fifties
against the Know-Nothings. With our
present large alien element —the
last census showed nearly four and
a half million alien-born citizens of
voting age, to say nothing of the
children of aliens and the native
Jews and Catholics who will natural
ly takes sides against the Klan —it
is evident that this policy stands a
large chance of success nationally,
and is certain of success in many lo
calities. The evils of an election
•based on these group divisions are
too obvious to need reciting! The
possible result in government by an
alien, anti-American alliance, is al
so clear.
When I pointed out to Dr. Evans
that the Klan by uniting these
groups was likely to insure not only
its own defeat, but the defeat of the
very principles of Americanism for
which it is standing, he minimized
the danger. He declared that the
very characteristics which have pre
vented the different national and re
ligious groups from becoming assi
milated, would also prevent their
joining for any one effective action.
This may be true in some ways, but
there is already plenty of evidence
that they are willing to join at least
to beat the Klan. .
It is in meeting this opposition
that the Klan’s secrecy comes to its
highest value, for the alien groups
cannot unite against Klan candidates
unless they know whom the Klan is
supporting, and they are barred from
uniting on openly alien candidates of
their own because of the certainty
that this would drive all Americans
into the Klan ranks, insuring its vic
tory. So they must work on the de
fensive, also in secrecy. But they
have not and cannot possibly have,
the solid and effective organization
of the Klan.
Their task then, is a hard one.
They must select their candidates
from among men who may already
be Klansmen, work with groups
which may include Klan members,
convince the Americans among their
followers that the men so selected
are good Americans, and the alien
groups that the same men are pro
alien. And they must determine from
among all the various candidates of
fered which one or ones are favorable
to the Klan and concentrate opposi
tion upon them.

The last problem is the most baf
fling, for the Klan will not label its
candidates. It has learned that les
son already in elections where open
Klan support has solidified opposi
tion to tne man it wanted elected.
Today its candidates are, when it
seems desirable, as secret as the or
ganization itself. In one recent
case the Klan press openly attacked
the very man for whom “the word"
finally went out. This system is pe
culiarly effective in primaries where
several candidates are running and
will often nominate pro-Kian men on
both tickets. It will not be needed
in many places, of course. Probably
in most sections where the Klan
operates its strength will be so great
that it can fight best in the open.
But when the fight is made behind
a hood, it will be baffling.
Nor is there much chance that the
opposition can find out in advance
wnat the Klan intends to do, a dan
ger which one politician told me
was enough in itself to defeat the
Klan. They could do this easily if
the Klan plans had to be confided
in advance to the whole membership,
for a leak would be almost certain.
But the Klan takes no such risk.
With its members waiting for “the
word,” that word can be held back
till the last moment, often even till
the last hour before the polls close,
when it will be far too late for any
opposition to act. The Klan’s sys
tem of passing information has been
perfected to a point where, I am as
sured, the entire membership can oe
reached in less than two hours after
the machinery is started. There are
more than five thousand offices kept
open day and night to make this pos
sible.
Altogether it seems that in this
very complex situation the great sol
idity and the amazing organization
of the Klan give it the advantage. If
it does get the nine million members
it may reasonably expect it will al
so have an advantage in numbers.
The one thing that is clear is that
in the coming campaign there will
be a mess of underground plotting,
secret manipulation, hypocritical
candidates and general wool-pulling
and lying such as this country has
never seen.
The blame for this at first
thought rests on the Klan, which has
caused the crisis. It seems, however,
that in fairness the real blame must
go back to the politicians and
groups which for years have been
dickering openly or secretly, by the
filthy methods described. The politi
cal crimes committed at the demand
of the German vote, the Catholic
vote, the Jewish, Italian, Polish, Ne
gro, or Irish vote, have been so many
and become so notorious that they
have automatically aroused opposi
tion. Not all members of the races
or religions named belong to these
group-voting blocs —by any means,
but the blocs are there, and are and
have been active, —often viciously ac
tive. The Klan in politics is only
the more or less accidental vehicle of
the necessary and righteous attempt
to twart them.
In the coming election the power
of the Klan as a mugwump minority,
although subject to the offset of
whatever union the anti-Klan groups
may effect, will be very great. Re
member that the results of any elec
tion would be changed if half of the
winners plurality changed sides. Re
member that the Klan now has 4,-
500,000 members, that it is likely to
have 9,000,000 and expects to have
12,000,000 by November. Then con
sider that in the presidential elec
tions in this century (doubling the
figures before 1920 to allow for the
doubled voting strength under wom
en suffrage) the average plurality
of the winning party has been only
a little over 3,500,000, so that an
average change of 1,800,000 votes
would have changed every election!
In many cases a change of 750,000
would have been enough.
Consider also that in most congres
sional districts a majority of 10,000
is rare, and that in normal years a
plurality of 50,000 for a state ticket
is high. Finally, remember that this
is a year when all politicians expect
a close vote. It is plain that if the
Klan can make even a fraction of its
members take its advice, and can
escape solid and effective opposition,
it may very easily win overwhelming
ly. .
But this is only a part of the
Klan’s political power. As great, if
not greater, is the effect it can have
privately on candidates, on officials
after they are elected and above all
on bosses. They cannot tell how
many votes the Klan cast, they can
not by any means be sure of any off
setting support, they are open to the
non-political pressure which the
Klan can apply so effectively. Their
easiest course will always be to fall
in with the Klan’s demands. This
form of terrorism of politicians, of
threat of reprisal combined witn
promise of reward, is a common fea
ture «of our politics, but the Klan
uses it with unprecedented force.
It is already doing so. I have not
yet met a single minor politician
who is willing to speak openly
against the Klan, and except for a
few of the Democratic leaders and
Col. Roosevelt —a possible candidate
in a state where the Klan is weak
and alien opposition would be fatal
there is no record of any of them
taking such a stand recently,
though it was fashionable enough two
years ago. The success of the Klan
in'so many local elections and the
greater threat behind it today, ha.-*
upset the calculations of politicians
everywhere, and has thrown local
bosses in many places into a truly de
moralized state of mind.

Head of Mine Union
Which Opposes Klan
JOHN L. LEWIS
At the recent biennial convention
©f the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica in Indianapolis, President Lewis
withstood the attacks of the radicals,
who sought to unseat him. However,
he fell right in line with the union’s
policy of decreeing the dismissal of
all miners known to be members of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Lewis has been head of the miners’
union for many years. At each con
vention, however, the power of the
radical, who put over such legislation
as the anti-Klan rule, has been get
ting increasingly greater.
don’t know which end they’re stand
ing on, and they duck every time
anyone says ‘Klan.’ They’re scared,
terrified, paralyzed, buffaloed, lick
ed!”
This is quite true. Thousands of
them are in a state such that if the
Klan offers them salvation on any
terms they will seize it gratefully.
There is, for instance, the case of a
man who for a generation has ruled
half a state by the good old system
of controlling nominations in both
parties, and then allowing the voters
to worry about which of his pets
they shall elect. Last fall he woke
up the day after election to find that
both of his hand-picked beauties had
been snowed under by a man whose
name he had not even heard. His
bewilderment and distress were pit
eous. He is still in a daze, as if the
sun had risen in the west, the U. S.
government had gone bankrupt and
fire had turned cold all at once. He
will listen very, very carefuly to
such advice and hints as the Klan
will presently give him about dele
gates to the national conventions and
next fall’s candidates. He is one of
the great host.
The Klan system is just as effective
where there are rival bosses or un
bossed rival candidates, either in the
election or the primaries. Each
knows that to win he must have a
few dozen or hundred or thousand
votes in addition to his regular
strength, and hold all that strength.
To each of these the Klan goes, say
ing in effect:
“We control a large number of
votes. We won’t tell you how many;
you can do your own guessing. But
some of them you have counted in
your own support and some are
against you. We can throw the
whole block either way. We also
know many things about your private
affairs, and have influenc with many
of your business customers and asso
ciates. Here, then is a pledge that
will satisfy us. Sign on the dotted
line.”
How many will dare refuse? And
of those who do dare, how many will
the Klan be able to beat? These are
the questions that must be answered
before one can estimate the Klan’s
chances of victory this fall.
Only a partial answer is possible
now. In local elections where the
party loalty is weak and national
issues do not enter, the system
should work almost perfectly, for
the reasons already given, until or
unless the opposition not only unites
but finds out what to do. This sys
tem has resulted in the thousands of
victories already mentioned, and will
undoubtedly win thousands more.
Nationally, it will work far less
perfectly. Insofar as the Klan can
work in the primaries and conven
tions of both parties, and succeed in
chooeing both candidates, it will suc
ceed completely. This will happen
in a good many cases. It will cer
tainly put a good many Klan candi
dates into congress. It may even
win the power to choose who shall
run for president on both tickets, or
at least to say who shall not run. Its
chance of doing this is best in the
democratic convention, where a third
of the delegates can prevent the nom
ination of any particular man.
But If it wins only half success in
the primaries and can nominate men
who are satisfactory on and not
<>n both tickets either for con
gress or the presidency, further suc
c<«s will be more doubtful. To win
then it would have to induce a vast
number of men and women to break
their old party ties, which would be
one of the greatest feats in political
history. It probably could win a
close election; it could hardly do so
if the Issues or the candidates got
any great grip on the public. Still
people are not voting as regularly as
they used to, and a good many of the
Kluxers are one-time Progressives,
who have learned how to bolt.
These are the factors in a problem
that U making grey hair for nn
t ional leaders in both parties. They
know that the alien groups have lit
tie party loyally, and will swing en
• I ass# behind a plank attacking the
Klan. They know that the Klanstnmi
ehpeclally In the south, have always
THE FIERY CROSS
been so party-bound that even an
anti-Klan plank could hardly make
them change, but they cannot be
quite sure that the Klan influence
might not do it this time. They can
not guess, either, how many Klans
men might be led across the party
line by a pro-Klan plank that would
drive off all the aliens. The problem
is to decide whether pro-Klan, anti-
Klan or silence will be most profita
ble. The problem, it will be noted, is
different for the two parties, be
cause the bulk of the alien vote is
now normally democratic.
One more point should be noted.
Although the Klan question will oe
uppermost in the minds of local pol
iticians in over half the country,
and will have a vital and perhaps
deciding effect on the whole situa
tion, it will be kept in the back
ground as far as possible. Neither
the Klan leaders, nor the politicians
who are either with them or against
them or on the fence, want it
brought into the open. It will in
evitably break out in spots, but on
the whole we face an election in
which one of the most important
and decisive factors will be almost
invisible and inaudible.
And ff the Klan wins? That will
mean in the first place the enact
ment of its national programme;
restriction of immigration and na
turalization, vigorous encourage
ment and some reform of the public
schools, perhaps some economy and
“good government” gestures, and the
barring from office of Jews, Catho
lics and alien born. On other things
the Klan will have no hold on the of
ficials or the legislatures, and must
let the winning party programme
take its course.
The Klan leaders might, of course,
develop delusions of grandeur run
wild, meddle with many things and
even try to persecute some one. But
they will not do this in their present
temper, and they are very unlikely
to try. Against excesses stands in
the first place the saving sense of
fairness which held America back
time and time again in crises.
There is also the well known fact
that responsibility usually makes
leaders more sober rather than more
reckless. And there is the final fact,
already explained, that if they do trv
to involve the Klan in new issues, it
will go to pieces.
They will be pressed to “broaden
out” by the fanatics and grafters in
side the Klan, and by advisers out
side, who will lay before them many
and plausible schemes. Some such ef
forts are already making trouble in
side the Klan. The leaders will lose
some of their followers with each re
fusal to support any folly, though
less if they adopt it. They will also
begin to lose as soon as they have
put through their programme, since
the Klan is a limited reform move
ment, and as Horace Greeley said of
the Know-Nothings, “It would seem
as void of the elements of persis
tence as an anti-cholera or anti-po
tato-rot-party.” So there is a very
strong probability that the Klan,
which almost requires a victory to
live after election, will find that vic
tory is just as sure a road to destruc
tion, if a little slower.
The result in local elections will
be about the same. The Klan rec
ord so far shows that these victories
will mostly be with reform tickets,
and most of the successes it has won
have resulted in better local govern
ment. But such victories, as Ameri
ca has dearly learned, are also short
lived, however useful. There will be
vigorous clean-ups, some economies,
some ousting of non-Klan people from
power, the fall election would seem
to be the beginning of the end of
the Klan on its present basis, whether
it wins or loses. The leaders expect
to make the organization permanent
after its immediate issues have
passed, through its educational and
good citizenship program and some
vague plans for government reforms.
This might be done, but this pro
gram so far is so nebulous that it
presents no basis for forming any
conclusions. It would make of the
Klan a very different organization.
It appears, then, that the Klan is a
great and growing power in politics,
a power whose sudden rise is one of
the most amazing in history-—almost
incredible. Its methods in this field
are even more effective than in oth
ers, but largely because they are not
unusual, are less open to criticism
leveled exclusively at the Klan. They
are different chiefly in that they
have been raised to an uncanny effi
ciency.
The Klan’s aims, in local cam
paigns, must usually command ap-
Eroval, and are supported nationally
y a very large body of public opin
ion which at the same time condemns
the Klan organization and methods,
and its standard of narrow and ex
clusive Americanism. It is sharply
restricted to its own limited field by
the nature of its membership, is
hardly likely to go outside it, and
faces sure and swift destruction
when, or if, it does. Its success will
be great unless the elements it at
tacks contrive an opposition both
solid and clever, and can be assured
almost exactly by the ability that
opposition shows. Its chance of suc
cess, finally, is considerable, but the
victory will have within itself factors
likely to lead to disorganization.
If I may go hack for a brief re
view of the previous articles, it
seems that the evidence shows that
the Klan today is a great power for
good or evil in every phase of life as
well as in politics. It has made a
tremendous growth recently, follew
ing important reforms, and can no
longer oe considered a gang of hood
lums, criminals, or a mob. Instead
it is respectable, largely composed of
very decent, well meaning and well
behaved people of the kind who are
the backbone of the nation. Its lu

are large and dangerous, but not t>|>-

BISHOP T. J. GARLAND
The Rev. Thomas J. Garland, pic
tured above, has just been elected
bishop of the Episcopal diocese of
Pennsylvania. He succeeds Rev. Phil
ip M. Rhinelander, who resigned be
cause of ill health. For the past 13
years, Bishop Garland has been con

post thoroughly familiar with the

reform go, no alternative except to
join the Klan or be content with
conversation. It has done much
good, both in improving the conduct
of its members, in influencing the
conduct of others, and in cleaning
up bad local conditions.
But when all this has been granted,
the fact remains that the Klan also
involves and intensifies great evils.
Its use of violence has been so large
ly controlled that it is inconsider
able. Its nomenclature and regalia
are after all more ridiculous than
dangerous. Its acceptance of so many
worthless members may—perhaps—
be excused in a new and fast-growing
organization. But the terroristic
symbolism remains, and an actual use
of terrorism, even though it be only
through scientific application of that
“social and economic pressure”
which is customary in any exercise of
public opinion. The meddling with
private affairs is abominable, in
spite of some good that results. It is
a sure road to greater evils, and is
indefensible in principle, intolerable
in any free society. This the Klan is
trying to eliminate, to be sure, but
it is an actual and great evil.
If it should cure these things,
however, there remain and will re
main until the very nature of the
Klan itself changes, its fundamental
principles of secrecy, espionage and
native, white, Protestant supremacy.
These things are inconsistent with an
Americanism under a declaration
which holds that all men are created
free and equal. They are dangerous
destructive, creative of disunity and
hatred and so long as they exist will
make impossible a free and united
nation. They cannot be too strongly
condemned.
Yet—l have been unable to frame
any indictment of the Klan for these
sins which does not cover other se
cret organizations, based also on nar
row race and religious division. No
reason has appeared why it must be
suppressed so long as they are tol
erated. The Klan may claim, with
out possibility of disproof, that these
threaten Americanism directly as well
as indirectly,-while its menace is only
indirect and its direct action is de
fensive of the national spirit, that
they were first in the field, chose the
weapons and gave the provocation,
and that it has no choice Dut to fight
them on their own ground. If that
is true, the blame for the situation
rests upon them, not on the Klan.
It may not be true, but it cannot be
disproved.
From these facts it may be urged
that the Klan, in spite of all its evils
and dangers, may do the country
good, like a noxious medicine or a
thunderstorm. Certainly there is
need of a better national digestion
and clearer air. It is. I suppose, a
matter of personal choice whether
one prefers to endure the illness a
little longer or until it gets worse,
or take such a violent and disruptive
dose, which may prove poisonous.
I should like inconcluding this se
ries .to make a few general observa
tions about the Klan which do not
rest on definite proof and which may
be no more than personal opinions,
though I believe tnem more impor
tant than that.
The first is that the Klan is no
very hideous menace. It can do much
harm, beyond doubt, and will do
some. The prejudices it has re
leased, the turmoil it has aroused,
its wrong principles and wrong
methods are all dangerous and might
be serious indeed. Perhaps I am a
little weary of many menaces, but in
spite of these things I cannot see that
i* is likely to do any great or irrep
arable harm.
For one thing, we can depend very
largely on the general good sense and
fairness of the members. They are
not a mob, nor naturally cruel or un
just. The Hare of prejudice will die
quickly unless fed from outside. One
correspondent declares that if the
Klan is not suppressed it will be
burning convents in New York, as
was done by a mob in the thirties.
If this is possible, then the decidedly
alien government of New York needs
overhauling, even as the Klan su>>.
Hut I cannot believe it possible, even
with all allowance for what the mob
spirit may do with ordinarily decent
folks. And the Klan leaders I have
seen would be the first to stop such
an outrage, if the city government
failed.
In the second place, the Klan is
getting better. Some of its worst
features are almost gone, others are
going. The leaders are of a more bal
anced type than at first, are being
sobered by power, and the better class
membership that has recently joined
is taking control.
As to an “invisible government,”
that seems sheer nonsense. The Klan
is a reform movement, working large
ly through politics, using the usual
politjcal methods. Any group con
trol of government is a menace, but
we have survived a good many of
them, some of which were invisible,
and the Klan is not the worst of the
lot. Our system provides the means
by which any group can be ousted if
it gets too strong or overbearing, and
the Klan itself is proof of this, since
it is a reaction against other groups
which have had'much power and used
it unwisely. Its political program
may be wrong, but it is negative. If
it does stop immigration, for exam
ple, and we find that we need more
aliens, the lack can very easily be
righted.
Beside all this, the Klan can hard
ly live long in anything much like its
present form. It is a protest move
ment, reform drive, and as such is
almost certain to be killed by either
success or failure. It has, beside,
within itself the elements of sure de
cay, grounds for dissension, for jeal
ousies. for division. Moreover it is
too high pitched; no body of men
can long hold the camp meeting fer
vor which the Klan now boasts with
out a complete reaction. It may be
changed in ways which will give it
longer life, but that is a possibility
outside the scope of this report.
It seems clear, too that the Klan
is doing much good along with the
harm. Its local reforms are likely
to be as temporary as the fervor and
prejudices it has aroused, but they
can at least be set off against those
evils. And its services in stirring up
thought and focusing attention on
the evils which now threaten Ameri
canism, are very great. This might
lead to solutions, even if the Klan
does not find them or bring them it
self.
The most serious menace and evil
which really lies in the Klan move
ment is quite different from any of
these. It is that the Klan may pre
vent needed reforms. There is bitter
need of some drastic action to stop
the flood of unassimilable immigra
tion, to Americanize the alien groups
which are hostile to Americanism, to
meet and defeat the influences which
are definitely trying to pervert and
degrade American thought and pur
pose. The danger is that the Klan,
by attacking these real problems by
wrong methods and wrong solutions,
may discredit all proper attempts to
solve them, and open the way for a
period of alien and un-American
domination that will wreck forever
the national purposes and opportuni
ties built up at such a cost.
I have been asked by several peo
ple whether there is behind the Klan
some mighty, Machiavellian brain,
controlling the movement and direct
ing it to hidden and possibly Satanic
ends. I have seen no sign of any
thing like this. The leaders with
whom I talked speak as those having
authority in themselves, and there is
certainly no Machiavellian brain
among them. On the other hand,
they were apparently overwhelmed
witn their own success, vastly sobered
by it, troubled as to what to do with
it, fearful of leading, but driven on
by the force they have raised.
Finally, it seems almost impossible
that the Klan can be destroyed at
present. The momentum is too
great, the demand for some action of
the kind it promises too intense.
The leaders are leading only in the
sense that they are out in front;
they as well as the ranks, are in the
grip of their ideas and cannot stop.
The Klan has grown from a few thou
sands to a few millions in the face
of ridicule, prosecution, persecution,
and weakness. Now it is rich, pow
erful and feared—l can conceive of
nothing likely to be effective against
it until it begins to break down from
the inside. The only possibility is
to find other and better means of
meeting the problems and evils which
give it strength, and this method
the most bitter of its enemies are the
least inclined to follow.
The movement can, however, be
guided, the dangers lessened, its real
ly valuable possibilities put to bet
ter use. The leaders themselves are
almost pitifully anxious for guidance,
they are seeking it everywhere and
offering large pay to some of the best
brains in the country to tell them
what to do—what they can do—with
their power. They are suspicious,
too, having already had such experi
ence with much wrong advice of all
kinds. But counsel they believe to
be disinterested, patriotic and fair,
they will welcome.
It is to this, it seems to me, that
those who fear the Klan movement
should now turn their energies.
There is undoubted danger for them
in such an effort, for the opprobri
um which followed the Know-Noth
ings may very easily attach to any
who give aid or comfort to the Klan.
But there is nothing else in sight
that promises to have any value
whatever in dealing with the move
ment.

KAMEUA SUES HEAD
FOR URGE DAMAGES
Simmons* Organization Charges
Him With Breach of
Contract
ATLANTA, GA., March I. Suit for
$25,000 damages was filed Thursday
in the Fulton Superior court against
William Joseph Simmons, by “Ka
melia, Inc.” of which H. Tom Kight,
formerly of the W. A. P. Study Club,
is national secretary.
It is alleged in the petition that
Colonel Simmons assisted in the or
ganization of the Kamelia in 1922 and
that he was given a contract to act
as “supreme ritualistic officer,” hav
ing charge of rituals, paraphernalia,
regalia and similar matters. For this
service he was to receive SSOO per
month for six months, it is alleged,
but although he actually received
$2,500 for five months’ work, he did
not perform the services required of
him.
The petition, in addition to asking
$25,000 damages for breach of con
tract on the part of Colonel Sim
mons, seeks an injunction against
him to prevent him from incumber
ing or disposing of his property, and
also to prevent him from engaging in
any activity which interferes with
the operations of the Kamelia. The
court granted the injunction as to
Colonel Simmons’ interference with
Kamelia, but refused to allow an in
junction regarding the disposal of
his property.
Florida preacher who declares that
“we have had enough of shooting,
whipping and burning in the name of
the Lord.” The answer is that the
Klan is so vast and varied an organi
zation that almost everything that
anyone has said about it, good or bad,
is true in spots. I have told of no
sins that are not admitted by ita
own officers, except where there is
full proof, and of no virtues not con
ceded by some of its most vigorous
enemies.
No fair reporter could do less, nor
could he base his reports on the facts
in any one locality, or small group of
localities, as each of my correspond
ents has done. I cannot hope that I
have been able to be always fair, or
always to find the full truth, and the
one virtue I can claim for these ar
ticles is that they do tell all the
essential facts that my limited abil
ities and a strong desire for fairness
have been able to find.
