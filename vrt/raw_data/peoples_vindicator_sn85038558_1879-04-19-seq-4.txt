sit ap at anidnight to correct their false

itIg-msany words, especially
tehacal and foreign terms, abbreviated,
weds mispelled, and few or no points,
and these few, if any, certainly in the
wrong place. We have seen the sermons
of eminent "divines" sent so the press
without points or capitals to designate
the dlvisiqa of the, setences; also the
letters of the political and seientiic cor
respondents. Suppose all these had been
so printed, the printer would have been
treated with scorn and contempt. No.
one would have believed that such gross

VEGIETINE
e, FOR CIILLS, IIIAK.~E,
S. FEVER and AGUE.
10 Tarboro. N. C Is .
MnM. II. R. brRVas :
IDear Sir,-1I feel very grateful for hi't y34ur
valuble meedecine, Vegotine, lu doeo in aew
family-. I wish to express may thanks by1.3 illnform
in you of the wonelerful aulr of lll son; also,
i- to lt vor know that Vegetin' is flhec Iws lritI
icine that I ever saw for lhills,. SZh:akes, Fever
li and Ague. My son was srick a itllh I,eaIles in.
I IT:1 which left him willtl Hip-Ioialint disease. )y
son taiered a great deal of paln, all et tll tillme:
ii, the pai wa no great he 4d1d notLhing blt crl'.
- The doctors did not help him a particle, che
e, could not lift his L oot from the dio,r, Ihe call
1 not move withouterutches. I read ou..r adeve
S iselment in the "Louisville Collaere-.Journal,
1 that Vegetine was a great Blood Puriicer and
Blood food. I tried one bottle, which was a
great benelit. He kept on with the nmedicine,
e gradually gaining. He has taken eihitee bt,1
tles in all, and he is emolmpletly restored to hlelt b,
3 walking without crultchles or caLne. He is twe.n
Sty years of age. I have a younlgelr en,. tifteenc
years of ago.e ho is subject to Chills. When,
t ever he feelsoaecotmming on, he cornes in takes
a dose of Vegetine and that is the last of .the
Chill. Vegetlne leavens so bad effects upon syi.
Stem like most of the mnedicined recoIendes d fti
Chills. I Cheerfully recommend Vegetine for
such conplaints. I think it is the greatest
I medicine in the world.
Respectfully, MRS J. W. LLOYD.
Vautrtlm .--Wlhen the blood becones lifeless
and stagnent, ether from chaLge of weather or
of elimate, want of exercise, iregular diet, or
r, from il other eause, the Vegetlne will renew
the blidi;carry os the parid humors, cleans the
stomacb, regulates the bowels, and imparts a
tone of rigor to the whole bºliy.
