A Card.
The Enterprise in the last issue
published two long editorials to
prove that the Populist leaders
were guilty of conduct unworthy
at gentlemen. To prove same it
ites the fact that I wrote a note
to my father asking him aot to
come on a" certain trin. This I
ra0Ily admit. I feared our peo
pie would be so incensed by men
from other parishes takiar part in
our affairs that a coalict might
emes I never had any fear that
the trala might be wreaked, as the
Eaterprihs would inter.
Now whenever anybody matkes
the statemeat that I asked fo a
postposnent t of the oo t with
te, latention o, massing c rowd

gemlesuly advantagerf any man

The Latest.
From the latest telegraphic dis
patches received as we are going
to press it is learned that the leg
- islature has voted to not go behind
the returns, and will seat Foster,
and it is now possible that the fair
State of Louisiana will have to
' endure Foster and Fosterism for
another four years.
so It is an admitted fact that Fos
L ter's majorities are received from
the negro parishes. In the twen
ty-five parishes where the white
vote predominates Pharr carried
21 and Foster 4. Then we see
that the white people of Louisiana
are compelled to submit to the ne
gro vote and the stuffed negro
vote.
It is indeed a contemptable sight
to see the party that ever talked
about white supremacy, depending
on the votes of negroes te sustain
, them in power.
From Baton Rouge, we learn
r that Foster has promised to sign rt
bill for a Constitutional Convmn
tion and a new election law, best to
people of Louisiana, a promise
from Foster is not received with
much consideration. trW think it
reasonable to preeum that any
man that will steal office will
not have to hesitate orng to break a
promise ; to rely upon the word of
Foster is indeed a poor hope for
redress.
The Citizoen'a League, elected
upon a platform of honest election
and fair count, have thrown All
principij overboard, and are now
upholding the steal of Foster.
It is indeed a sad day for hones
ty iniLuisiana.
Resoltieons.
May 4th, 1896.
At a meeting of the People's
party club bheld at Tabernacle
school house, the following resolu
tions were adopted :
Whereas, the vote cast for par
ish and State officers in this par
iash (Natchitoches) on the 21st day
of April, 1896, show fraud as
promulated by the Returning

Editor Iouisiana Populist :
Sir-A letter has bcen sent to a
citizen of this ward, stating that
ward three and the Rob aline }):x
would be settled by the court, arnd
that this would decide the n-aletor
in favor of the Populist canditates,
r but that if it did so they, t:.I Deti
ocrats were determinei to put
r their men in the ofiicer, if it re
quired guns to do it.
If it mus come to guns, I know
what the people of wvard five will
do. We are theroughly organized
and determined upon insisting that
we have our rights. We have
sought to w'.ng no one, and we
shall not a'llo w them to carry out
their lremtiitated scheme for our
disfranchisement. We are white
men with the instincts of white
men, gad Xurphy J. Foster with
hi's prsrtiamns and abettors in fraud
canuotwenslave us. We know that
there was nothing unfair about
the voting in ward three, and that
the shooting into the polling place
at Robeline was the work of the
Democrats for a vile purpose.
We now say that they shall not
put aside the men whom we have
t elected, and place over us those
whom they may fraudulently de
clare elected, with the sacrifice of
nothing but their oaths, which they
regard as nothing.
When we toll them this, and
warn them that it were better for
their defeated candidates to ac
knowledge their defeat and retire
than to risk the exasperation of an
outraged people by attempting to
hold offices to which they have no
right, they will no doubt start the
terrifying cry Of revolution.
Well, if revolution is the end,
it was not our begining. Long be
fore the election the decision was
ma e at Democratic headquarters,
and passed to Natchitoches, and
from there among the people was
sent this warning: "You might
as well give it up now, for no mat
ter how manny votes you may cast,
we will never surrender the offices
to you ?"
The excuse for this evolutiona
ry threat was that we favored ne
gro domisatico, &c., while at the
same moment these hypocrites and
pretenders to a high-toned "white
supremacy," were placing negroes
on the Democratic ticket as candi
dates for office in some of the ne
gro parishes where they could not
force, but might bribe the negro
vote.
If the air begins to glow with a
revolutionary game let it be re
membered that their own vile
breath and acts began it.
- The Enterprise asserts that
whomsoever handles the negro,
must get down to his level. We
have proof of this in the condition
the Democracy as it now is, for -
it has got below the negroe's level.
No negro could do a more coa
temptible thing than rob white
me of their vo*sis the mid De
moacy is now doingr.
The Emtrprlse has mueh to my t
about our visit to Natbhitohes to .
compel the coatilng of the votes.

these tedy to compel that count,

w FIFTH WARD.
,d The People's Messenger has this
at to say in repard to the Louisiana
e election :
ie "The State election in Lonisi
it ana last week discloses the usual
ir conditions in the negro belt. Fos
to ter, the kDemocratic candidate for
to governor, running on a platform
:h declaring for certain amendments
d to the constitution, which had for
it their object the 'elihmination' of the
It negro from the ballot box, claims
it to have been elected on the vote of
,e the black parishes. That is, if the
e count is honest, the negroes voted
to disfranchise themselves. The
,t white parishes almost unanimous
e ly voted for Pharr, the fusion can
didate for governor, and the large
negro parishes are counted solihdly
,fFoster, and thus 'white suprema- I
Y cy' of the Democratic variety is
maintained in Louisiana as in Ala
d bama, Georgia and Mississippi, by
counting negro votes not cast
against white votes actually de
posited in the box.
e "In New Orleans, where the
better class of citizens, irrespect
ive of party, combined in a league
to rid the city of boodlers who
had been preying upon it for years,
the opposition to the 'regular Dem
ocracy' was successful by a ma
jority of more than 11,()'O, But
this could not have been accom
plished, except through the ut- 4
most vigilance on the part of the
t opposition to the machine, with a
show of force that deterred the
heelers from bull-dosing and bal
lot stufiing. Without such a de
termined effort even New Orleans
would have been made to give the
usual Democratic majority."

A Strange Mirage.
A Sky Picture of a Chicago
Building Seen at Warsaw, Ind.
The strangest phenomenon ever
seen in Warsaw, Ind., was visible
recently during the big storm. It
was a mirage of the Masonic tem
ple in Chicago. The great build
ing hang in the sky, apparently,
over a wagon factory near the
public square.
It was a strange day in more
ways than one. The wind was
high and rain fell furiously. Hail
as large as walnuts rattled on the
housetops and battered the win
dows of buildings. A great cloud
hung, after the storm had subsi
ded, in the western sky and ow its
face was pictured the Masonic tem
pie in complete mirage.
The structure was plainly visi
ble, anad people could be seen walk
ing about in its vicinity. Warsaw
is 109 miles from Chicago, on the
Pittsburg and Fort Wayne road.
It has a population of 8,500.
