-The digging of ditches, grading
of streets, repairing of side-walks,
would be to this town, no luxury,
but a necessity badly needed.
-Some public spirited citizen
took unto himself the responsibility;
and immediatly repaired the Lou
vierre bridge. Thanks to you,
friend.
-The moving of the Royville
lodging rooms caused some excite
ment in town Saturday.
-The roads between this town
and Broussardville are nearly im
practible. No drainage the main
cause of these boggy and impassable
roads.
-Since Mr. Lessin Broussard
has built that protection levee, pre
venting the water from taking its
natural course, the public road
facing his place is forced to act rs
ditch; thus causing the public, much
inconvenience due to the boggy and
deep holes, formed by the quantity
of stagmant water remaining. We
would like to see some action
taken concerning the cutting of said
levee, as in our estimation, Mr.
Broussard has no right to prevent
the water from taking its natural
drainage.

""Les Jeunes Captifs" was per.!
formed by thie Carencto ainateurs
at Falk's Opera House last Saturday
night to a fair audience. The fol
lowing is the cast:

Des brigands.
Before the raising .of the curtain
.Miss Lea. Gladu, a young. lady of
fine musical skill, executed a beau
tiful composition on the piano, en
titled "La Marche Canadienne."
The play was exceedingly wel"
rendered. The characters were
well placed and spendidly sustained
during the whole of the perform
ance. Claude Latiolais, as chef
des brigands, was excellent, and
his lieutenant, George Melchior,
was perfectly at home and elicited
merited applause. L,. G. Stelly
played his part admirably well and
contributed largely to the enjoy
ment of the. audience. The little
Misses Odile Crouchet and Sarah
Brown, were very interesting and
are highly deserving of praise for
the intelligent manner in which
they played their parts.
Between the first and second acts
Mr. H. VanderCruyssen favored
the audience with an appreciated
song which Was well received.
Miss Antonio Melchior, a charm
ing young lady of Carencro, deliv
ered a fine recitation. She spoke
in a clear, distinct voice and ac
quitted herself very creditably.
Miss Emma Falk, of this town,
generously volunteered her services
and sang two pretty songs. It is
useless to say that she was applauded
to the -cho.
At the conclusion of the enter
tainment the young folks cleared the
hall of the chairs and enjoyed them
selves by dancing until a late hour.
The music was furnished by the
Lafayette String Band, under the
direction of Frof. Walter J. Mouton.
Deplorable Accident.
A sad accident, the result of a
practical joke, happened five miles
from Duson, last Saturday night,
which, only through the purest
chance did not result in death. The
particulars, as far as we have been
able to learn, appear to be these: At
the home of Mr. Israel Prejean,
while this gentleman was away, were
several young ladies spending the
night with Miss Arsene Duhon, sis
ter of Mrs. Prcjean. Tie young
ladies thought it would be a good
joke to disguise themselves in men's
attire and frighten Ralph Duhon,
toe only man in the house. No
sooner thought of than it was done,
and after getting into disguise, they
silently stole out from the rear and
stepped or, th;e galicry and knocked
at' the door. Mrs. Prejean an
swered tl e call, sligltly opened the
door and inquired wi.o was t..ere.
RW:th-out answering t..e young ladies
rushed in only to be met by Ralph
Duhon, wl o thinking they were rob_
bers taking advantage of the ab
sence of Mr. Prejean to commit rob
bery, ý,pened fire upon them with a
pistol, the first shot taking effect in
the neck of Miss Arsene Duh'n, his
sister. He tried to shoot again but
the pistol, fortunately, would not re
volve, else some of the others might
have been shot. After the first
shot, the girls began to scream and
made themselves known, and, of
course, they all deplored the ending
of what they anticipated would be
real fun. Dr. O. A. Clark was
summoned, and after examination,
pronounced the young lady's wound
serious, but not dangerous. At last
reports the young lady was improv
ing nicely.
