their mandbles, after which they
fasten it to the top of the hive. More
wax is then drawn from their bodies
and fashioned into balls to be attach
ed to that which was previously fast
ened to the hive. In this way piece
by piece of wax is rolled and man-I
ulated, and pressed by the bee's
oy, until it assumes the sixsided
shape of the wonderful cells whlh
are a marvel of insect building. Cell
is added to cell in this manner till
the comb Is complete.
After the home building is done
the queen Is led over It by her at*
tendants. She deposits in her march
a" egg In every cell, and should she
by accident leave two in a cell, the
extra one is quictkly destroyed by her
attendants. The cells are not all
the same sl~e; upon the she of the
cell depends the future condition, as
worker drone or queen, of the baby
bee whch will Issue from the egg.
There appears to be no difference in
Sthe egrs, everything depending upon
the cell nto whiio they happen to
fall and the food given to the little
grub. There are a certain number of
royal cells where the queens are
sourishedv The little grubs hatched
SIntheWs are no different from those
hatched in the celis of drones and
those of workers, but the shape of
the cell is different, and the food,.or
royal jelly given to the baby queens,
Is different from the food of the com
mon bee-baby; so the grubs become
differeat, d in a very mysterious
way become little queens.
g All goes well in the hive until one
lof these little queens, more forward
r than the rest, comes forth from the
Soooon ready to take her place as a
N royal personage. and assumes the
postlon which she knows falls to her
Sof right. And now what do you
o think the tyrannical young lady
of does to begin with? She walks to
each royal cell and stings each baby
queen to dleath lest it should come
e forth to disputto her authority; then
r she proceeds to drive the old queen
out of the hive, quite well aware
e that there is not room In the colony
for both. This ctan not be done at
once, but there is a very uncomfor
table time in the hive, and th6 work
era cluster about the queens very
in allantly; though there is a great
deal of buzzing and commotion, the
hy two royal personages are not allowed
to risk their precious lives by com
ing t0 blows.
At length scouts are sent out to de- Ch
I termine upon a location for a new
Shome, and after a reat coming apd F
e oing and buzzing the old 4lueen Dit
iaves the hive in gareat indignation, ly
or followed by the whole swarm, who
alight in a mass wherever she alightse,
e clinging to eaeh other by means of
* their little booked hands until they f
