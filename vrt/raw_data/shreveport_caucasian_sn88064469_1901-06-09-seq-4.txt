Do Not Monkey With a Neigh
bor's Dog.
The Tlimes-Clarion, Longview,
Texas, says: An Alabam wamn shot
his neighbor's dog. Tie neighbor's
boy shot the man who shot the dog.
A son of the man who shot the dog
shot the boy who shot the man woo
shot the dir. The man who shot the
dog shot the brother of the boy who
shot the man who shot the dog. This
may be a sumbersome way sf getting
at an item of news, but is tells the
story tauthtlnly and in a way every
man can understand it. The lesson
we desire to impress is that it is daa
gerous to monkey with a neighbor's
dog.

sition is to soil eig ht lut! to t :,

money in one or miore buildings to
ne used for pubhlc sctools.
The city provides that "stud sctc o
houses be owned and coutrolled uý
the city."
The Pariah School' Board has ob
jected to this proposition on the plea
that such action will embarrass and
probably defeat a plan through waich
they expect to secute $75 000 ey the
is no of bonds, the authority for
which is to be obtained from the tax
payers, at an election which is to be
ordered by the Police Jury of Cadlo
parish for that purpose. The School
Board favors the lease against the
sale, at.dexpects the rental to d fray
expenses of the schools which must
be met
The Sohool Board has jurisdiction
over the parish of which Shreveport
is a part, but the. School Board can
haveuno control of the affairs of the
city.
The jurisdiction and the power of
the city is limited by its c crtier, an3
the city can exercise no authority in
)arociual legialation. -
The Police jury has themauthority
to order an election, as provided by
law, at which the taxpayers may vote
uppa themselves a tax for school
balldiags, and such an election any
be ordered for what may be desig
nated the Shreveport School District,
but the city has no such power, and
the cfty can provide a tax for street
Improvement and Are department
and railroads only.
As it Is conceded that public school
houses are an imperative necessity
and the cry for at least one additionsa
building, with desirable conve
niences, is long and loud, unceasing,
we may say, what was more natural
than the plan suggested through
the Hicks resolution?
The query for consideration is.
Has the city the ;right to sell these
eight lots, batture property? Has
the city the right to invest the money
from such sale into one or more
school houses for the use of the chil
dren of the city ?
It has been:conceded that the city
is possessed of such right.
Is the amount offered a tullivalua
tion of the property, and can a
greater amount be obtained ?
It the city has the right to sell at d
no greater amount can be setnred,
why not approve the sale?
Which is the best po;icy, to sell or
to lease?
A great deal is being aaid about
lease. L-ase is the plaint, the panacea
which is to relieve all co nplaiuts and
from which :great blessings are to
flow into the public schools.
What has the.city to lease?
The record will disclose that the
property in question is leased and
yields a rental per snnutu as follows:
Cotton Belt, lease 13 years.......300
House adjoining, lease exjires in
103............ ............ 10 0
House adjinlng Manning's, lease
expires in 1903 ............... 4l 24
Manring's stable, lease expires in

Total............................1 772 75
The batture lots in block 69, on
which are located Parson's fouidry,

We ho'd, as a busintess propoalionc
tha' property, evou if is be ownit' by
the citv aad which ils to realizl at
least t per cent of its valuation, is
u-pr fitable.
We bold, as a business proposition,
that the city can derive no adequate
benefits from limited rentals, and s.,
long as the property is owned by bhe
city it can have no assessable value
and therefore can; yield no revenu" s
to the city, parish and State?
It is the policy of the State to sell
"public domain" to homesteaders
who, by improving the land, give it
an assessed valuation which is fixed
in keeping with the improvements.
Such lawn yield no profit to the
State when it is owned by the state,
but it becomes a tax producer when
it Is the property of the individual.
The Levee Board also sell "the
public domain," which is unproitable
uatil it is owned by the Individual
who contributes, In time, a revenue
by taxatioa to the State and the
parIeb.
If the.city were to sell all the bat
lare lots. on. the beels of $21,000 for
the eight lots, the revenues which
would acorse in taxation would be
greater than the rentals which con d
be realised and the revenue from tax
ation would lacreasse in the proposi
tion of the improvement of the prop
erty, whether it be held by a railroad,
a Arm or an individual.
Viewed from a practical business
standpoint, We believe it to be the
best policy to sell, as the moment
these lots are sold they be
some assessable property and will
ylead In taxation a revenue much
greater than the amount now being
paid for rental and for wbich the
company has a lease which will not
expire in less than thirteen years.
Viewed from a business standpoint
and from this consideration we are
Arm in the opinion that "the city
would reap the benefits of the appre
elated value," and the benefit by the
inves'ment in one or more public
schools, which cm li be erected this
summer and be ready for use nexi
tall and winter, would be to "hte
best interests of the c ty of Shreve
port."
The sale of the property in quee
tion and the erection by the city of
,4 or more school bouses, should
operate no bar to or interfere with I
any plans of the School Board. On
the contrary, it is the Caucasian s
opinion that the city's action wonud
give greater eudorsemeant and stimu.
1 is to the School Board in their plan
to realize 175,000 for public s-bo)l
l urposes in the Shrevepor. school
district.
The Caucasiau stands for school
houses and will give loyal and ui:
s inted support to the Schoel Board
in building school houses, but what
ever be the zeal of the most enthusi.
astic it would not be poesible to
make available this year, the necee
eay taxation wuich wovla have to be
voted, at a special election, for that
purpose, even if ordered by the Police
Jury at its session next week. Thb
legal delays would bring the issue
after the time fixed at which the
Police Jury make their annual budget,
and it is dounitnl if the practical
work on the school buildings, cone
emplated by the School Board, could
be cmtrriA out beforl a year (r

VE EdAiv's SUGGESEION TO
DALLAS.
Special to the News.
"New r~eans. La., Jane 2.-At a m
ing of Confederate V terane at Memarnl
Hill today the late policy of mlaiun tie
annual reunions great soci atthre was
roundly denounced. It w.is said toat tLe
Veterans had no show in the practice of
making the occasion one for maids of
honor, sponsors and distinguished per
sonages. The idea of making it a Confed
orate reunion was ensirely, lost. sight o!.
Indirectly the Mnmphis reunion was
tormed a good example of the social eyect
In this connection the Louisiana V te rats
will strongly urge that a new policy be
pursued at Dallas next year. It was suge
gested that Dallas be requested to take the
money which she will raise for the reunion
and with that sum build temporary cot
Lages and quarter on the State Pal
g-ounds, woere the old Veterans ean go
into camp for a week and sleep and eat by
the camaptree, tell their stories and hold a
genuine soldiers' reunion. This would be
the Veterans' part of the meeting, and it
would occupy the Fair grounds. The
soelal events could take place in the city,
and the one would not interfere with the
other."
The Caucasian would suggest that
one or two days should be appointed
at which to consider business and
measures for "the good of the order."
In the past ten years little business
of any practical benefit to the camps
has been considered. The grand dise
plays by the generals, colonels, etc.,
and the social functions have ab
sorbed the delegates named to the
conventions. do great ie the burry
to dispatch "the businesg" that reso
lutions and other matters of impor
tance are referred to committees,
and toe big show is generally over
before the reports, with few excep
tions, can be submitted. The busi
ness nays of the reunion should pre
cede the show at teast a day or two
before the beginning of the grand
'isplay, etc.

T i. other i,; A. N. Miller, who built thin
I Savomv hotel in this city and who held a
i0-rrlihg interest4 in it noltil he sold it
to Judge Dugro of the New York su
prenl court. Mr. Miller is accounted a
wealthy man.
Frank Eaton, a wan'ering prospector
in l"4 looaur-d the section under scrir
issued by the government of Orillie
Stram, a half-breed Sioux Indian
woman. Examination of the claim has
shown an outcrop of at exceedingly
high grade iron ore extending for a
mile and estimated to be worth from
$3,000,000 to $10,000,000.
- This discovery caused keen competi
tion for the property and Eaton's title
was subjects d to close scrutiny. Vari
ous interests sought to acquire it and
in 1899 the Midway company, which il
controlled by Mr. Miller, obtained tith
from the secretary. of the interior
through Frank Hicks, on the ground
that Eaton's location was illegal. Other
claims were made, but the Midway com
pany defeated them all, taking the case
twice to the United States supreme
court. Finally Eaton remained the only
obstacle to its complete control and it
began proceelings to have this title,
founded on the half-breed woman's
scrip, declared void.
Judge Samuel H. Moer, of the elev
enth judicial district, who is now a
member of the law firm of Moor & Ed
son of this city, heard the case and
much to the surprise of the Midway
company, decided in favor of Eaton.
This case was taken to the highest
court in Minnesota which sustained
Judge Moer. It has now been carried
to the supreme court of the United
States.
Though the surface indications point
to the conclusion that the mine is one
of the richest to be found in the coun
try not a cent has been expended in
working it while thousands of dollars
have been paid in litigation. *It is look.
ed upon by experts as the best property
in the range which has been made fa
mous by the Chandler, the Soudan, thc
Tower and the Ely mines. The Ver
million mines are chiefly owned by the
Minnesota Iron company.
In the Mesaba range about 30 miles
away are the Rockefeller Iron mines
which have already been acquired by
the United States Steel corporation.
Eaton, whose title hitherto has been up
held and who will be raised from pov
erty to wealth, should the decisions
stand which have been given, lives in
Duluth. Ther- is with, -pread interest
