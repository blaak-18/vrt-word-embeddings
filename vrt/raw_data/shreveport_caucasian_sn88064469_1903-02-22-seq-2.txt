AWFUL CATASTROPHE
Sxpress Train Runs Into a Carload
of Young People.
SEVERAL ARE KILLED
The Deplorable Affair Happened at
Newark, N. J., and the Victime
Were Pupils on Their Way
to the High School.
Newark, N. J.. Feb. 20.-Running
at almost full speed a train on a Dela
ware, Lackawanna and Western rail
scad crashed into a trolley car load
ed with pupils on their way to the
high school yesterday morning.
Eight of nine children were killed,
and at least fifteen injured, some so
badly that it is feared they will die.
The accident occurred at the Clifton
avenue crossing, long noted as a dan
gerous spot. The trolley car was one
of the special vehicles which the
North Jersey Street Railway company
runs between 8 and 9 o'clock five
mornings in the week for the special
accomodation of the high school pu
pils. It was crowded with young men
and women from all parts of the city,
many whom were transferred from
other lines. Immediately after the ac
cident had been reported all the police
reserves of the Second precinct were
sent to the scene to keep back the
crowd, which gathere4 almost imme
diately.
The train which caused the accident
was the Delaware and Passaic ex
press There is some question as
whether both thin crossing gates were
down when the car and train ap
proached at the same time. The mo
torman saw the train and put on the
brakes with all his force. The car,.
however, slid upon the icy rails until
the front platform projected over the
tracks. A moment later~the crash
came. The pilot of the engine struck
the front platform and tipped the car
over. The pupils by the force of the
collision were precipitated under the
wheels of the engine. To some death
came immediathly; others lingered a
moment in fearful. agony and then ex
pfred. A most heartrending scene
was presented to the sight after the
train had crashed into the car. Dead
or injured children lay in all direc
tionm
Word of calamity soon reached the
authorities. In addition to the police
reserves every ambulance in the city
was soon at the scene. The motor
man's skull was crushed, and it is
thought he will die.
The trolley car c net be stopped,
although the a appeared to
make drastic ,ifte to 40 so.
The conducur : of the tilley ear,
Geosge Gould, said: "It is a custom

was picked up three blocks further

BAIL REFUSED.
OMef anitlee Pope Would Not Permit
Bond to Be Made.
Columbia, S. C., Feb. 20.-Chief Jus
tice Pope refused the application for
ball of James it. Tillman. It was the
rule of the court, he said, in such
cases, to make no explanation of the
reasons governing the decision.
"Murder was the taking of human
life with malice aforethought. With the
oath of office so recent upon his lips
he must do his duty and decline the
application without prejudice to the
case of the defendant.
A multitude of affidavits. .overing
the case with an infinity of detail, were
presented by the state and a large
number in reply were read for the
defendant The state presented a
number of affidavits from Edgefield
people impeaching the testimony of
the affiant Holtzbake, and also declar
ing that the affiant White was a para
lytic past fifty years old, the result of
paralysis being to weaken the will
power and moral nature of the affiant.
The defense replied with affidavits sus
taining the reputation of Holtzbake
and the competency of vvhite. The
state presented affidavits from Repre
sentative Lancaster of Spartanburg
that he saw a pistol in Tillman's pock
et on the day preceding the shooting,
and another from a Columbia gun
smith that F H. Dominick, of New
berry, previous to the shooting,
brought him a magazine of a pistol
and that he repaired it.
F. J. Watson of The State newspa
per swore to a conversation with Till
man last summer, in which the latter
requested him to tell Gonzales substan
tially that a continuance of the news
paper attacks would be at his peril
Watson declined to onvey the mes
sage.
0. D. Black, a railroad man, made
affidavit that Tillman told him on a
train and again in August, that he
was going to kill Gonzales, exhibiting
the magazine pistol. Robert Lathan,
Mr. Gonzales stenographer, swore to
a statement of Mr. Gonzales taken by
him when near. death, relating to the
story of the shooting.
Mr. Gonzales declared he had sent
Tillman no message and considered
the matter ended.
Several well-known citizens of Co
lumbia who saw the shooting testifled
that Gonzales made no threatening meo
tion.

'I thought you were dead!'

I received a letter from a firm that
makes a businesd of furnishing news

that the firm would be glad to furnish
obituary notices of myself at 5 cents

Mr. Outhwaite declined to say wheth

Senator 1ason of Illinois sat in his
committee room. the other day looking
out at the sunshine and singing mer
rily, though somewhat qff the key.
"You seep, happy, Billy," said a
friend who came in, "for a man who
has just been beaten for re-election."
"Why not?" asked Mason. "I al
ways try to look on the bright side of
things. Do you remember the story of
the Irish shoemaker out in Chicago
who had both legs cut off by a train?
"'Cheer up.' said the "urgeon who
came to trim him up. 'It might have
been worse. You can still work at
your trade.'
"'Sure it might have been worse,'
answered the Irishman. 'Suppose I
had been a chorus girl."'

thoroughly disgusted with what he
calls the dense igno

Country which he is laboring

"There are people in the east," said
the territorial delegate to a group of
members in the Republican cloakroom.
"who ordinarily would pass as well in
formed who think that New Mexico is
somewhere at the earth's end. I fre
quently get letters bearinj a 5 cent

the impression that New Mexico is

"A friend of mine, a merchant in New
Mexico, went to New York city to buy
a large bill of goods. He entered a
prominent wholesale house and said to
it member of the firm that he wislieti
lb place an order amounting to severi i
thousands of dollars.
"'Where are you from?' the firm
member asked.
"'From New Mexico,' my friend an
Swered.
"'The export department is on thi
fifth floor. Take the elevator.' was tI-
merchant's response.
"Now. I want to know." said Mr.
Rodey. addressing the group. **If yowl

e U.is beareris admitted tbhat they never

Representative Maddox of Georgia,
who had the floor, appealed to the
speaker to restore order. The restored
order did not last long, however, and
Speaker Henderson's gavel came down
with a whack that made members
jump.
"The louse must be in' ordeF." he
thundered. "The gentleman from Geor

An olrglan Abb was senator oe
fore the civil war haunted the cuamber
at times and occasionally succeeded in
negotiating a loan from one of his
former colleagues. Senator lrnes of
Nevada, who hia* known and Oik'd
him in his better days, often tided him
ever serious difficulties and rarely
turned a deaf ear to his importunities.
On one occasion the ex-senator went t#
Mr. Jones and said:
"Senator, have got to go away for
six months, an(' itwould be a great ac
comimodation to me if yogcould let io'
have $."u for that time."
"Suppose you make $ a year." re
plied the Nevada senator, "at.. 'l
-make it a hundred."
"I will do it," emphatically remarked
the "ex," and the bargain was made.
The- strangest part of it is tha4 the
man actualiy stayed away a year. and
Senator Jones considered the $100 res
sonably well invested.
The status of Nevada in the Snion
was touched upon in the senate the
other day in the course of the debate
on the statehood bill, and Senator Stew
art, sometimes called "Old Father
Time." promptly showed up and de
tended his 'tate.
"Didn't the senator himself:' asked
Senator Beveridge, "advocate the an
nexation of Nevada and Utah?"
"I never advocated the annexation of
Nevada to Utah," replied Senator Stew
art. "but I was willing that Utah should
be annexed to Nevada."
Senator Stewart did not seem to un"
derstand why everybody should laugh.

"At the senator's fourth meeting in

he said it was the regret of his life that
his parents were not married a few
years sooner, so that he might have
been born in time to join the Union
army, and told his hearers what a leg

had he been able to don the blue, shoul
