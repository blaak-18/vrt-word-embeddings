NOTHER Easter has
breathed its benediction
upon the spring. Another
perfect Sabbath, when the
sky was clear turquoise,
the hills flushed with the
amethystine tinge of vio
lets. A day whose rare,
sweet beauty and sacred
significance wrought on the soul like
music, filled it with that pathos which
conies from “the depth of some divine
despair. ’ ’
The ultimate mystery, Death; the
unquenched hope, of Resurrection.
How fair was the familiar world,
its sky and field and woodland, its
streets hushed of the rude noises and
the traffic of the week. Tenderly fair
to all seeing eyes. And, when the
white lids shall have been folded down
for that last, long sleep, will there
come then any visions'? Ah, we do
not know. We can but hope, some of
us can believe, but no one can know.
Yet, it is far easier to resolve
everything into all spirit, than any
thing into all matter. Death is as
natural as birth, and birth is as
mysterious as death. There is no
one thing more wonderful than
another. And out of this comes the
Great Reconciliation, between forces
that otherwise would seem unalterably
antagonistic, when each has been bent
to an holy purpose, purified of the
dross. Pure Science delves into the
secrets of Nature no less reverently
than Pure Religion feels Its way by
Faith. In love and in humility must
good men, whatever be their calling,
however great may be their learning,
meet and murmur: We cannot know;
we can only believe, only hope.
And it is best to hope, to become
as little children who must grow,
before they may understand. Nothing
is more impious, more revolting, than
any denominational or priestly inso
lence that presumes to intervene be
tween the human heart and God, that
gives the husks of dogma instead of
the living bread, that presumes to
direct the faltering feet of humanity
along some path that leads, not to
the peace that passeth understanding,
put to petty bickerings, to tithes, to
fat Bishoprics, to narrow creeds and
superstitious rites.
In pure religion can be no degrada
tion to any intellect. From the sense
of accountability to a power higher
than man’s has sprung and always
will spring a courage leonine.
The testimony of the “still, small
voice” loses none of its power, al
though cycle upon cycle sweeps by
and brings yet no sound from the
“voiceless lips of the unreplying
dead.” So always there will be trust
in Immortality and the hope that
lightens that black hour in which we
surrender to the grave all that is
dearest.
As we dip into Biology, the wonder
of life deepens and grows. Each tiny
one of the millions and billions of
cells which go to make up plant and
pnimal life pursues its own round of
existence. Not once in seven years,
but daily, hourly, momently, our
bodies change. The hand that writes
this is not in all its tissue exactly the
same hand that wrote the paragraph
Under The Vine and Tig Tree
Conducted by Grace Kirkland
preceding, the memory that makes
possible the recollection of how to
form words remains, although the
actual memory cells are no more
enduring than any other protoplasm.
Something determines the individu
ality and the vital spark presides over
the manifestations of life. Reduce
everything to the terms of chemistry,
and we get no forwarder; take
the molecule, then the atom, then
the ion—all theory, of course, but still
we find, no matter where we turn, or
what solutions we essay, the result
is that matter is simply unthinkable
in the last analysis. We must say
“force” or “spirit.”
Wherefore, why may we not justly,
reasonably and reverently believe that
that Creator who gave to each of us
a distinctive personality, made of each
one of us, whether by direct creation
or the process of evolution, an indi
vidual not like any other that ever
was or will be, has a purpose which
does not ruthlessly disregard our long
ing, our suffering and our hope?
To the orthodox believer in a Hea
ven and a Hell, as definite and fixed
places, to one or the other of which
all must repair, it may seem strange
to debate the question of Immortality
at all. But the world is restless and
skeptical, and not one but many are
suffering because they must reject the
monstrous idea of eternal punishment,
they cannot believe all they have been
taught to believe, and, giving up a
part of their older views, are literally
adrift upon a troubled sea of doubt.
Why may we not be at peace? What
an individual, or a community or the
whole world believes cannot affect the
truth. In our ignorance, in our help
lessness, we can but hope, and should
cling to whatsoever sweetness and
comfort it affords, knowing verily that
the power which created can re-create.
Unconscious, we keep no track of
time. Between falling asleep and
waking, moments, hours or days may
elapse. The time asleep is, to us, as
though it had never been. The ele
ments are indestructible, and when
those of which our bodies are com
posed are disunited, who may say in
what form they may not re-unite? Or
when? Flesh, as we now know it?
Spirit, as we sometimes dream it?
And how could we know whether we
were changed “in the twinkling of an
eye,” or only through Aeons of time?
Neither in great deeds or works,
nor in offspring, is there an immor
tality that satisfies the yearning of
the soul; for who may know whether
or not posterity will honor him? And
children merely represent, they do not
duplicate, their parents.
And so, inseparable from the
thought of Resurrection, a part of
Eastertide itself, is the hope that
somehow, somewhere, that which is
best in us will survive, that which is
so imperfect will yet attain perfec
tion; that the old wounds will heal,
the treasures hopelessly lost here will,
in Eternity, be restored.

ARMENIAN LULLABY.
If thou wilt shut thy dreamy eyes,
My mulberry one, my golden sun!
The rose shall sing thee lullabys,
My pretty cosset lambkin!
And thou shalt swing in an almond
tree,
With a flood of moonbeams rocking
thee—
A silver boat on a golden sea.
My velvet love, my nesting dove,
My own pomegranate blossom.
The stork shall guard thee passing
well
All night, my sweet, my dimple
feet,
And bring thee myrrh and asphodel,
My gentle-rain-of-springtime,
And for thy slumbrous play shall
twine
The diamond stars with an emerald
vine
To trail in the waves of ruby wine.
My myrtle bloom, my heart’s per
fume,
My little chirping sparrow.
And when the morn wakes up to see
My apple bright, my soul’s delight
Thy partridge shall come calling thee,
My jar of milk-and-honey.
Yes, thou shalt know what mystery
lies
In the amethyst deep of curtained
skies,
If thou will fold thy onyx eyes.
You wakeful one, you naughty son,
You cooing little turtle.

SO-GLAD, PLENTY AND REST.
(A Story for the Little Folks.)
By Beulah Johnson.
“Do tell us a tale, Auntie,” said
Helen; “Please do,” said Bobert,
jumping to my knee; “Oh Mama,
you said you would,” said Henry.”
Baby Florence came with her rosy
lips to kiss Mama to pay for one.
All the children gathered near me
and with Florence and Robert both
on my lap I began to amuse them, as
I often did after the evening meal.
The first story ran thus:
Once upon a time there was a mule
that was old and unable to do any
work, but he could eat like he always
did. One morning this mule started
out down the road. He had not gone
far before he began to talk to him
self. “O, yes,” he said, “they will
look for me, but I am gone now, and I
won’t get killed if I am too old to
work. I can graze for my living,”
and on he went till he had just passed
a house. He heard a noise and looked
around and saw an old gray rooster.
“Good morning, brother Mule,”
said the Rooster, “where are you go
ing so early?” The mule answered:
“I don’t know. Do you want to go
with me?” “Yes,” said the rooster.
“What makes you want to leave
home?” asked the mule. “My mis
tress says I am too old to keep, so she
told her John to have me caught to
kill for dinner, but they won’t kill
me. I heard her say this last night,
so I got up early and came out
here. ’ ’
u lf you want to go with me fly
up on my back,” said the mule. So
the rooster flew upon the mule’s back
and on they went.
When they reached the end of the
lane there stood an old gander and
he sand, “God morning, brother’
Rooster, where are you and brother’
Mule going?” “We are going to
the land of Rest and Plenty,” replied
the mule. “Do you want to go?”
“Yes,” said the gander. “I heard
my boss say that he thought I was fat
enough to sell to the Jew ai town, so
1 wasn’t ready to die and came off
here.” “Well, get up on my back,”
said the mule,” so the gander said
“Yuar-yuar,” and got on the mule’s
back.
The old mule laughed to think he
had so much company. He went along

commences the work with a general love
for mankind and suffers his feelings
to dictate to his reason, runs a great
hazard of reaping a plentiful harvest
of ingratitude and closing a tedious
existence of misanthropy.**
This is the language of a disap
pointed man.
General Marcus J. Wright says of
him: “In 1835 he was defeated for
congress. This preyed heavily upon
his spirits. He had tasted popular
favor and enjoyed high position and
was loath to give them up.”
He determined to leave Tennessee
and seek new fields in Texas. Some
verses of his, the only ones he ever
wrote, show the condition of his mind
at this time. He says:
“Farewell to my country, I fought
for thee well,
W hen the savage rushed forth like
the demons from hell.
In peace or in war I have stood by
thy side —
My country, for thee I have lived,
would have died.
But I am cast off; my career is now
run —
And I wander abroad like the prodi
gal son,
Where the wild savage roves and the
broad prairies spread,
The fallen, despised, will again go
ahead. ’ ’
Col. Crockett was killed at the
Alamo by the army of Santa Anna.
He falls and expires without groan, a
frown on his brow and a smile of
scorn and defiance on his lips. A fit
ting end to his heroic life.
In a few years some of you will be
charged with care of others, and will
be obliged to reserve to yourselves
leisure for meditation, prayer and self
examination, and diligently watch
over your own souls.
He that is bad to himself, to whom
will he be good?
Let your home life be as full of sun
shine as the meadows are of daisies in
June.
If you desire God should hear your
prayers, hear the voice of the poor.
Work whilst you can, whilst you
have time.
Hoping you will all make good
knights—that is, true men— I will
say Banner,
