PAGE FOURTEEN
A CHRISTENING REHERSAL.
“I christened the other day the first baby
of a married college girl,” said a clergyman.
“Now, babies usually cry while they are being
christened, but this one was as quiet as a
lamb. Throughout the ceremony it smiled
up beautifully into my face.
“ Well, madam,’ said I to the young wife
at the Christening’s end, ( I must congratulate
you on your little one’s behavior. I have
christened more than 2,000 babies, but I never
before christened one that behaved so well
ae yours.’
“The youi>g mother smiled demurely.
“ ‘No wonder he behaved so well,’ she said.
‘ His father and I, with a pail of water, have
been practicing christening on him for the
last ten days.’
“The idea of rehearsing a baby for a
christening! Who but a college girl would
think of such a thing?”—New York Press.
“The good Lord knows where we are going
to get any campaign fund for Bryan,” says
Col. Watterson. That may be so, but some of
us think Mr. Bryan has at least a suspicion.—
Washington Post.
The “Give Us a Rest” campaign of the
National Prosperity Association should not
be expected to arouse intense enthusiasm
among the out-of-work contingent.—Washing
ton Post.
“Do you know of anything that is harder
io get than money?” asks an exchange. No;
we do not, but Mr. Bryan does. —Washington
Poet.
