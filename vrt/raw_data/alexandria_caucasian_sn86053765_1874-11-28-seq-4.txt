For two years past, the UNIVERSITY,
alt ho a Slate School, has had no State pa
tronage, and very little private support,
»till it survives ; and with the dawn of
the brighter and better day—now, no
doutd., near at band—for the State and
people, our School must reap the reward
of it« patient endurance, Ululer long sttfler
inj. and neglect, s it will lie duly apprecia
ted, we hope, by the people, mid become
what it was designed to lie, an institution
of learning, worthy of a great State, and
of a free and prosperous people.
COMMERCE .did enlightenment, go
hand in hand together. The Geographi
cal and Commercial punitions of La., will
in spite of all present drawbacks, soon
force greatness lipon her.
NEW ORLEANS will become populous
and rich beyond the expectation of tho
most sanguine now; and here, almost ill
its Muhilrbs, on the first bluff from the sea,
yet on the bank of the great. River, will
he, in time, the chief Sclioel of tho
MISSISSIPPI valley,
and we must patiently abide on time—
learn to labor and to wait.
THE CITIZENS of Louisiana ami of tho
adjoining States, are respectfully ref|iie»,|
ed to consider the advantages, which l I ii»
UNIVERSITY ad'oids for the education
of their son», and to accord It that sup
