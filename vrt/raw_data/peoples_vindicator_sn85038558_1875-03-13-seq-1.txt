Northern Louisiana Said, Amton, ret

ing
(Shreveport (La.) Letter, of the 15th, to Inti
Cincinuati Commercial.) on
There is a colored man here who )110
has done what not one iu a quarter dist
of a million of his race have succeed- on 1
ejn in doing since emencipa- mel
t n. Born and reared a slave, he ry
has since the war accumnulated about clai
twelve thousand dollars' worth of Ste
property. The name of this man is ion
Abner Hall. lie has the confidence Tre
and respect of all classes and colors. not
In company with a friend I went mw
around to see Hall. lie works at of I
the foundry of L. W. Jones as a pat- uea
tern-maker, earning good wages and get
putting in every day. I asked him ren
about the political situation of his cloy
race in tihs region, and first as to his the
own political views. He said he had Ho
always voted with the white people, rea
and used all his influence with his Hlo
race to get them to do so. "The etc
white people own this country," he wh
said, "and we must live here if we the
live anywhere. A cold country, such poi
as up North, dosen't suit us. This the
is our home, and te must be at peace otl
, with the white people. They will do tin
, the fair thing if the colored people do.
My idea is that the Conservative par- on
ty is the party for us colored people ad;
to go into. me
,. "They always nominate the best pri
id men for office, and always go for a ed
peaceable government and low taxes. tie
n These high taxes which the Radicals me
put on the country finally come out ral
of the poor negro, if he had sense chi
enough to see it. A white patty and an
a black party, such as we have had iul
so much of here, will ruin any coun pre
try. Look what it has done for Lou- gri
isiana. The Radical party is a cheat- pe
ing party. Look how they got us all M(
to deposit our money in what they pe
called the Freedmen's Bank and then of
stole it. Little do they do for the el
nigger except to get his vote and Pr
steal what little money he makes ap
throughl the banks." m(
"Did you lose anything by the an
Freedmen's Bank," I asked. is
"No, sir; but I had a whole year's ka
earnings there, and just did get it lal
out in time. I smelt a rat, I took it so
out and put it in a bank run by men pe
who live here, and who I know will ha
do right. The next day I tried to lic
get out fifty-nine dollars that a friend Ai
had in the old trap, but it had done ae
shut down, and the money went up be
the spout. Al, sir, xou don't know M
how muIch worry and suffering the X
poor colored men have had about la
that bank. Some had in three htqi- vt
dred dollars, and from that all the ly
way down to fifty cents. re
"That, sir is just one of the main pa
reasons why the Conservatives car- es
ried the election in this parish. The bi
colored men voted with them right un
straight along. I think I influnenced fI
as manny as two hundred myself. I tim
reckon more. I worked as hard as I lii
R could. I put in my time, for I knew tI
I was doing a good work for my race." i
"The Conservatives carried the m
election, did they " w
"Yes, sir, carried it in this parish cc
by over six hundred majority, as true in
as you and I stand here. Te count- Si
ing out of the men we elected to the fa
Legislature was the biggest chleat la
Sthat ever was. What's the use of
t, having an election if they can do tllhatt
ir The Radical party live by cheating. L
It is all that they have got to go on.
Nobody pretends that they carried l'
h. the election in this parish. You can't
find a Radical who will say it. They
ill know we can beat them, and that the ol
he Ueturning Board cheated us out of d
e what we had fairly worn. The Con
servative party, sir, as much as has 3
been said about it, wouldn't do that n
mean."
"Did the colored men vote the Con- n
servative ticket freely and voluntari- ti
Sly "
"Yes, sir; the election was the p
fairest and most quiet we have ever c
d had here. Everybody says that. But a
the Returning Board counted in the d
very men that were beaten. What's p
the use of having an election when t
8., they can do that way I" j
I mentioned tiht it was necessary 1
to count out a few Conservatives so I
as to give the Republicans the Leg
islature. But Mr. Hall protested that I
it was no fair way to do, and that if 1
the will of the majority can be set
aside that way, we had as well abel.

over entirely to thie Returning Boards.

d UNCLE BILLY'S OBJIECTIONS TO CIVIL
RIGHTS.
y I "interviewed" Uncle Billy, a good ec
e old colored friend of mine, the other to
af day, on the question of civil rights.
- "Don't want nuflin mo'," said Uncle te
is Billy. Got too much already fuir dis
at niggab." ti
"How is that, Uncle Billy ? Is i lil
R- not a good thing to be equal before
i- the law " .
*Now, Marse Boss," grunted Billy
be plaintively, "dai's jist whar de misery a
er comes in. We're ekal befo' de law, ii
ut an' dar yer hit onur weak pint. Befo' lii
he do waw, of niggah stole chicken an'
t's pig, yerjerked him ip, guy hinm thir- I
en ty-nine lashes, an' let him . go. I ut1m
jistlet a collud pusson try it now *
ry Yer hiauls him 'fore de court, an' sem's 4
so him to the penitentiary, jist like lihe
g- was one uv ygr poor white trash. f
at Dat's what 'tis to be ekal 'fore de s
if lpw."
et I suggested to Uncle Billy that this I
l- might be obviated by being a little c
ry more honest.
s "Marse Boss," interrupted Bill,
"we can't run agin natur'. It's nat'- a
or, ral fur niggah to steal pig and chick- a
as- en, fryin' size. Yer knows it is, an'
m- tain't no use tryin' to stop us. Now we 1
unes are willin' to let you nons alone, a
and you all jist let us alone ou dis
pint, We're powerfal weak on dis t
the pint, Marse Boss."
Just here a preverse and disloyal I
' spirittempted me to hint to Uncle a
SBilly that the colored people were
an indebted to their iepublican friends
oy for this change in their statbes.
"Well, den, Marse Boss," said he,
c'"all Ise got to say is, de laws get to
be change, hab a law for de white
a man and a law for de black man."
d Strange as it may seem, some of
this our best citizenis echo Uncle Billy's
Ssentimuent, They are inclined to
Sview the negro's minor transgressions
in a lenient light, and I know that
sonme of our Democratie judges im
pose lighter penalties upon colored
irtsmen for sall offenses than they
glt would do in cases where the guilty
the parties were white.
y Before Lucle Billy left I asked him
how he would like to sit down at the
table with white folks at the hotels.
"Great poddlemighty 1" exclaimed
oh the good old man. "'I allow yonse
-il tryin' to make fun o' die chile. Why,
you know yourself dat no eullad pus
son ebber lets a white man see 'rm
the|t e of ey kin lielp it 1"
rot. Thisis strictly true. The ordinary
SorL Southern negro will not eat in. the I
/ presence of a white sjcctat&r.
'"Well, Uncle Billy," I said, "it is! Fa:
very evident that you don't want
any civil rights." P
''ot anyting ino', I thank you," r
replied Billy. "Nearly dtle ruined the

bills ; lost all toy lmoney in the Freed-' ' a,
eIen's Bank ; lneer got no forty whi

Tie above is no production of the Iiand
fancy. It is a true incident, honestly driv
told, and itis inmpossible to talk to f,,
the coniitry negroes without hea;riu toot
just such things as I have related. is al

Do WoLF TEI:TI INJURE IloRSEi'
r rsY-This question has bothered
the veterinlary surgeons some, most
of them, however, deciding that they
- have no eflfet on a horse's eyes,
Swhile practical horse men and deal
, ers all grce that they do, and the
-irst motion of a shrewd dealer whenl
noticiug a weak eye in a horse is to
itel for a wolf tooth. If it is there
• "and the horse suits otherwise, he
ldrives :as close a bargain as he can,
for a blemnished horse, knocks the
tooth out, and in a few days the eye
is all right. Sonime horses lose their
eyes fromt them, if allowed to remain,
I remlember one ease particularly.
The piroprietor of the stur stables in
- ,,ur city, purchasing a minle that was
blind (getting it for a song), knocked
out a pair of wolf teeth, and the eyes
got all right. I myself thought the
- eyes too tfir gone, but his judgment
was better than mine, I have bought
thousands of horses and mules, and
have no doubt but I have 'had fifty
c'"ases of wolf teeth, that affected their
eyes; but if not too far gone, a re
duction on the price would induce me
n to buy, satisfied Iy removing the
tooth, the eyes would come all right,

The Dressed Weight of Animlals.
d Farmers, who have had but little ex
Sl perienlce in feeding animals for the
f market, are often disappolinted be.

i, weigh as nuclh as they thought it
t, would. They are, likely to overlook
i- certain points which ought always to
i, be taken into account when estima.
t, ting the dressed weight of animals.
. . Age. An old animal will not
if dress as much in proportion to its
t, looks as a young and growing one.
Af 2. The degree of fatness. A cres.
I- ture which will weigh a great deal
of miora than one equally itas large, but
r- which has not been well-fattened,
of 3. Alnount of grain which has been
s, fed. An animal whih:l had twenty or
re thirty bushels'of meal will dress muooh
heavier than one which was in eqally
to good, order when the fattening was
r- colmmenced, and which may look
's equally well when it is finisliA, but
which has been fed only half as much
D- meal.
a- 4. Length of tinie in which grain
e. has been fed. A creature which has
Is been mealed for five or six months
will weigh more than one which has
n, about the same quantity of meal, but
ie has been fed only half as long,

of Protection of Iron from Rust.-The
er following mixture is said to be an ex
12 cellent brown coating for protecting
b. iron and steel from rust: Dissolve
he two parts crystallized chloride of iron,
two parts chloride of antimnony, and
it one part tannin in four parts water,
and apply, with a sponge or rag and
to let dry. Then another coat of paint
m. is applied, and again another if neo
. essary, until the color becomes as
dark as desired. When dry it is
washed with water, allowed to dry
again, and the surface polished with
boiled linceed oil. The chloride of
,h antimony must be as nearly nestral
m- as possible.
re- Large Chleese.-An Ohio paper an.
he nounces that a monster cheese is to
ed be made in that State for exhibition
at the Philadelphia Centennial. It is
to weigh. fourteen tons, and will
ld measure thirteen feet in diameter and
ro. eleven feet in thickness. It will be
as made in May, 1870. It is lbecoming
the custom in various localities
ra. abroad to cut up large cheese for the
Christmas market, and in England
ery the advent of big chleeses from this
md conntry is looked for with interest.
The latmn steamer which left New
99 York a fortoight ago took oueat a num
ber weighing from 300 to 600 pounds
tie, each, one weighiing over 1,200 pounds,
red and osie weighing 2,200 lponds. The
all marks and cuare are said to be per ,

cheeses appears to be well uuder
