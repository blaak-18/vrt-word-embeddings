“FRIENDS OF TARIFF” HEDG
ING ON PROMISED
REVISION.
Already the (Republican) “friends
of the protective tariff” who admit,
under compulsion and the influence of
fear, the expedience of revising the
present scandalous schedules —after
the election, of course —and under the
leadership of Chairman Payne, of
the Ways and Means Committee, are
collecting, or are supposed to be col
lecting, data for the information of
Congress when it reassembles, are al
lowing information to leak out that
indicates there is little to hope for
in the way of revision from them.
We have never had any faith in se
curing real revision from this source.
We are, therefore, in no wise sur
prised or disappointed.
Now the treasury deficit and the
necessity of providing sufficient rev
enues to meet the increased expendi
ture of Government is being used as
a more or less plausible pretext for
exercising “great care” in the matter
of revision.
It seems to be assumed by the pro
tectionists that the public does not
understand and cannot be shown that
an important duty that is prohibitive
while ideal as a creator and protect
or of a democratic monopoly, yields
not one penny of revenue to the pub
lic treasury.
It enables the few individuals who
own and control the monopoly to levy
a heavy tax on the people of this
country; but the proceeds of this tax
goes to these individuals, not to the
Government. It is also obviously
true that the higher the duty on a
given article that can be produced in
this country, the less importation
there will be, and, consequently, the
less revenue to the Government.
The obvious policy of the protec
tionist is to becloud the issue and pre
vent a true understanding of the prin
ciples involved.
They even have the effrontery to
pretend that a reduction in the Ding
ley tariff means a reduction in the
public revenues, whereas every mod
erately intelligent protectionist knows
that the reverse is true.
The expedience of revising the war
taxes is even being gravely consider
ed by the Republican leaders, it is
reported, in order to replace the loss
es that they pretend to think a revis
ion of the present tariff will entail
upon our revenue.
Whether these things are allowed
to be made public in order to calm
the fears of the beneficiaries of the
tariff, and also to prepare the public
mind for only a pretended revision,
we do not know, but it has somewhat
that appearance. —Richmond Evening
Journal.
The negroes are vowing vengeance
on the Republican party and are turn
ing in crowds to the Democrats, ac
cording to authentic information.
It’s not the negro’s nature to turn
away from the unprotected hen roost
unless he spies something through the
open door of the kitchen. Put that
down and figure out the answer, Mr.
Southern White Democrat. —Meigs
(Ga.) Review.
THE BRYAN THAT I HAVE
KNOWN.
How much longer will William J.
Bryan be able successfully to impose
on the credulity of any considerable
number of his fellow citizens? How’
much more evidence will be necessary
to open the eyes of those who remain
deluded? These questions naturally
arise after reading the monograph of
Colonel Guffey, of Pennsylvania, on
“The Bryan That I Have Known.”
The Guffey conclusion that Bryan
is a quack is not new. For many
years it has been evident that beneath
Bryan’s thin plating of pretended po
litical virtue was the base metal of
a person exceedingly selfish and
greedy.
Bryan attacked Guffey and ap
pealed to the Pennsylvania delega
tion not to re-elect him national com
mitteeman on the ground that Guf
fey is a “corporation” man. In 1900
Guffey was exactly the same kind of
a corporation man that he is now, yet
Bryan was on his knees to Guffey
begging for secret contributions to
his campaign fund. As Guffey says,
referring to himself, W. R. Hearst
and the late Marcus Daly: “Bry
an not only accepted gratefully, but
beseechingly sought our aid; and we
gave secretly thousands and thous
ands of dollars.” Guffey sent stained
glass windows to decorate the luxu
rious home that Bryan has erected
since he entered politics, and Bryan
was glad to have the gift until a Chi
cago newspaper published the story.
When the transaction was found out,
Bryan became angry and accused
Guffey of talking.
The following statement is unchal
lengeable: Bryan has considered any
man clean, any money clean, that was
obedient to him; he has attacked as
unclean any man or money that was
in his way. He denounced Roger C.
Sullivan,; of Illinois, as a train rob
ber, as a political corruptionist and
tool of selfish financial interests, and
then went into partnership with Sul
livan when the latter agreed to give
him the Illinois delegation. Bryan
denounced Croker and Tammany poli
tics and then rode around the streets
of New York in a carriage with Crok
er, shouting “Great is Tammany, and
Croker is its prophet.” Bryan de
nounced Thomas F. Ryan, yet Bryan’s
brother-in-law and his national com
mitteeman from Nebraska secretly so
licited and received Ryan money to
be used to carry Nebraska that Bry
an might have a chance to come the
senate. Pretending to be an opponent
of the trust, he has notoriously been
a pensioner on the bounty of Wet
more, the tobacco magnate of St.
Louis.
Bryan has supported the cause of
free trade and abandoned it; sup
ported free silver and abandoned it;
supported imperialism and abandoned
it —and in each case his support or
abandonment has been connected
with what he thought was his selfish
ohe ‘SUffersontait
political interest. Yet there are still
some who pretend to think that Bry
an is something more than a mere
scheming politician. He will be when
papier macjie becomes wood —when
bricks of brass become bricks of gold.

THE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE
AND HIS COHORTS.
Wonder if that negro Hearst had
at his convention will, also, come to
Georgia, along with William Ran
dolph Hearst and John Temple
Graves to help Mr. Yancey Carter
speak ?
It is said that Willie Hearst will
deliver two addresses in Georgia this
year during the campaign, one in
Atlanta and the other in Macon, and
you know, John Temple Graves will
spend about two weeks delivering ad
dresses in our state—John’s Windy!
Just how many the Hearst negro
will deliver is not yet known —that
Hearst negro is the one that John
Temple Graves had with him and the
other hirelings of the Hearst news
papers, at that so-called convention
of the Independent League (which is
copyrighted by W. R. Hearst). Don’t
you know they all felt good, listen
ing to the negro!
If the negro takes good in Geor
gia, William Randolph Hearst may
make four speeches instead of two,
it all depends upon the negro. At
these Carter shows in Georgia, there
will be four actors, viz.: Yancey Car
ter, William Randolph Hearst, John
Temple Graves and the negro, all
side by side —all in a row —speaking
to us Georgians of the Independent
League (copyright) Party.
Go your route, John Temple
Graves, you and the African!
/Speak, John, hollow, negro, you
all belong to Hearst —Hearst is mak
ing a tool of John Temple Graves and
Mr. Graves is making an ass of him
self, in braying for Hearst, to keep
his job, that’s all. —The Fitzgerald
Leader.
BRYAN AND THE SOLDIER.
Recently Hon. Thos. E. Watson
charged that Mr. Bryan, when a mem
ber of Congress, voted against Crisp
for speaker and gave as his reason
that he was a Confederate soldier.
Mr. Bryan indignantly denied the
charge.
In a letter to the editor of The
People’s Paper, of Charlotte, Mr.
Watson renews his charge against Mr.
Bryan, as follows:
“There is no doubt whatever that
Bryan made the reark about his re
luctance to vote for an ex-Confeder
ate soldier. He is dodging the issue.
He did vote for Crisp, but that was
after the caucus nomination had
made it imperative that he should do
so.
“It was during the contest between
the candidates in the caucus that Bry
an threw away his vote on Springer,
who was no longer in the race, telling
Mr. Lewis that he did not care to
face old soldiers of his district with
a record of having voted for an ex-
Confederate.
“Mr. Bryan will not deny that he
used the language.
“He shirks that question altogeth
er.
“Yours truly,
“Thos. E. Watson.”
To this, Mr. Bryan has made no
reply, and as Watson says, we don’t
think he will, because he can’t.
And judging by the action of the
late State Deocratic Convention,
the Confederate soldier stands no
higher with the present Democratic
leaders in this State than with Bry
an. —The Caucasian.
DANGEROUS ALLIES.
“If the negroes vote the Democrat
ic ticket,” remarks The Anderson, S.
C., Daily Mail, “they are going to
expect political rewards, and if the
negroes are to be taken into the Dem
ocratic party there will be no excuse
left for the South to remain solidly
Democratic any longer. Every negro
Democratic vote cast in the North and
West thist year will mean a hundre-1
Republican votes in the South in the
next election. ’ ’ Which, except the
obvious overstatement at the close, is
all quite true. If the negro’s present
trend toward the Democratic party
were inspired by less unworthy mo
tives than desire to punish a Repub
lican President for not ignoring mid
night murder where negro troops com
mitted it in a Southern town, some
thing quite different might be said,
but facts like these are hard. We
feel certain that the Democratic party
can derive no ultimate benefit from
such an alliance. The mass of South
ern voters have at least some little
spirit, and they will not submit to
any and every imposition even at the
hands of the Democratic party. —
Charlotte Observer.
THE HEARST CONVENTION.
A full-blooded negro at the Hearst
convention made riproaring harangue
in favor of social equality. The well
trained payrollers cheered the Afri
can orator lustily. The two Geor
gians who were on the stage while
the negro was speaking manifested
no displeasure. They took their med
icine dutifully, just as the delegates
from the other Southern States took
theirs at Denver, when the Bryanite
band pranced around the Georgia del
egation playing “Marching Through
Georgia.”—Davie (N. C.) Record.
It has been reported that Mr. Bry
an has said his committee will not
accept over SIO,OOO campaign fund
from any one man. Now, those who
desire to contribute to the Bryan
campaign fund should be careful not
to send over SIO,OOO at any one time
as it would be rather embarrassing
to have the contribution refused and
returned to you. —The Caucasian, Ra
leigh, N. C.
