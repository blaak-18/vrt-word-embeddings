CLUB No. 11— CORNELIA, GA.
A large and enthusiastic meeting
was held at Cornelia, Ga., on Friday
night, December 10th, for the pur
pose of organizing a Jeffersonian Club.
Mr. J. J. Brown, of Bowman, Ga., was
present and made a strong speech,
explaining the need for organization
and the objects of the club. The fol
lowing officers were elected: Presi
dent, C. W. Grant; vice-president,
D. A. Henderson; secretary and
treasurer, Ernest J. Kimsey. Com
mittee oji by-laws, E. J. Kimsey, D.
H. Brewer, D. A. Henderson and T.
M. Patterson. The next meeting
will be held on the second Saturday
night in January, at 7.30 p. m., in
the office of E. J. Kimsey.
ORGANIZATION OF THE BAXLEY
JEFFERSONIAN CLUB.
Dear Sir: —According to previous
arrangements, quite a number of Jef
fersonian Democrats, of Appling
County, met at the courthouse at
Baxley, Ga., the 17th, and organized
a very enthusiastic club by electing
H. C. Newton president, S. A.
O’Quinn, vice-president, and J. E.
Murphy, secretary-treasurer.
We find that the people of South
Georgia are wide-awake to the fact
that the time for organization of the
masses in non-partisan educational
political clubs has come, and you may
rest assured that you will hear from
these people. We predict that in the
near future Baxley will have one
among the strongest clubs in our
State.
The people are not allowing any
past party affiliations to hinder them
from joining in the effort to restore
our great Government back into the
hands of the people.
Knowing full well that the ene
mies to the principles of government
as taught by Jefferson and Jackson are
depending upon the disorganized con
dition and indifference of the people
in order that they may more securely
fasten upon us the principles of a
concentrated government, we there
fore earnestly appeal to all liberty
loving American citizens to call a
meeting of the Jeffersonian Demo
crats and organize these clubs, in or
der that we may better understand
each other when the time comes to
fight the political battles of the fu
ture.
Respectfully,
J. J. BROWN.
Atlanta, Ga.

Just get to the Austell Building on

In executive session, the following
Obe 3cf|ersonian
By-laws and Constitution were regu
larly adopted:
By-Laws.
This club shall be known as Jef
fersonian Club, No. 9, Atlanta, Ful
ton County, State of Georgia.
The officers shall be a President,
and a Vice-President, and a Secre
tary and Treasurer. The duties of
the president shall be to preside at
each meeting, and in the absence of
the president the vice-president shall
act.
The Secretary shall duly keep
minutes of all meetings, and a list
of all members, with their postoffice
addresses, and shall see that all mem
bers are properly notified of the dates
of meetings. He shall also forward
notices of meetings and reports of the
work of the club to the official organ.
The Jeffersonian, for publication, at
least every three months; and he
shall have notices .and reports of
meetings furnished to the local pa
pers for publication.
The duties of the Treasurer shall
be to keep a true account of ail
moneys received, paid out and on
hand, and to make report to the club
each month. He shall also report to
the President and Secretary all mem
bers whose dues are delinquent.
At the will of the club, the Secre
tary may act as Treasurer.
At each meeting a doorkeeper
shall be appointed, whose duty it
shall be to see that no person enters
the room during business sessions
except members of the club.
Each member shall pay one dollar
per year in advance, or ten cents per
month, club dues. Delinquent mem
bers shall be suspended upon a vote
of the club.
It shall be the duty of every mem
ber of this club to secure as many
new members as possible, by circu
lating the literature of the club; and
by explaining our principles and the
platform on which we stand.
Th© Platform.
“We believe that the great
transportation lines which
under modern conditions have
become the public highway be
fully controlled by the Gov
ernment, in order that dis
criminations against individ
uals or cities or sections may
be prevented and equal privi
leges accorded to all.
“We stand for the constitution
al money system of the fath
ers. We say that all the
money—no matter what it is
made out of —is the creature
of law, and that every bit of
it should be created, by the
Government, and issued di
rectly to the people; and that
every dollar so created should
be the equal of every other.
“We stand for the Income Tax;
for the Initiative, Referen
dum and Recall; for a Par
cels-post, and the Postal Sav
ings Bank.
“We favor the placing of the
necessaries of life on the free
list.
LOCUST GROVE INSTITUTE
Has had an increase of 25 per cent, in patronage during the Fall Term.
Every place in the Boarding Department has been filled. As usual a few
pupils will not return after the Holidays, consequently there will be a few
vacancies which can be offered new pupils, as follows:
6 in BOYS’ HOME, board sl3 per month.
2 in GIRLS’ HOME, board sl3 per month.
5 in BOYS’ CO-OPERATIVE CLUB, board $8 per month.
4 in GIRLS’ CO-OPERATIVE CLUB, board $9 per month.
Board in private homes $lO to sl3 per month.
Spring Term begins Tuesday, January 4th. New pupils should come
Monday, January 3d.
Those desiring places for the Spring Term should make application at
once to
CLAUDE GRAY, President, Locust Grove, Ga.
“We favor every just demand of
labor, —the eight-hour day in
such industries as workshops,
mining and manufacturing;
the abolition of child-slavery;
the compulsory adoption of
life-saving inventions, etc.
“We oppose the national bank
ing system; the alien owner
ship of land, and the holding
by railroads and other corpo
rations of vast areas which
are not necessary to their le
gitimate business.
‘We demand the election of
United States Senators by di
rect vote of the people.
We declare that the irresisti
ble power of the Government
should not be used to build
up one industry at the expense
of another.
“We demand the withdrawal of
the special privileges which
create private monopolies
and trusts. We say that so
long as monopoly privileges
remain in private hands, they
should be taxed to the full
value of the privileges.
“We demand extension of full
political rights to women, sub
ject to the same educational
restrictions as they may exist
relative to the male voter.’’
Our Constitution, organization and
by-laws shall be subject to change at
any time by a majority vote of the
members of this club, on local mat
ters, or by a majority vote of all the
clubs in the State, on State affairs,
under the State organization of Jef
fersonian Clubs; or by a majority
vote of all the clubs in the United
States; on national affairs, under the
national organization of Jeffersonian
Clubs.
In other words, this club, and the
State and national unions of Jeffer
sonian clubs, shall be a pure Democ
racy; their officers and Constitution
shall be controlled by the members,
and by the members alone.
We recognize no authority in the
affairs of the Jeffersonian Clubs, ex
cept that which comes from the peo
ple.
Let the people rule.
Agents’ Prize Contest
The competition for our cash
prizes this month is very keen, and
all the leaders are close together.
There are some “dark horses” run
ning—new agents who have just
taken hold —and our old agents will
have to look to their laurels.
Don’t forget that there are prizes
to the amount of SIOO.OO in cash, to
be given away on January Ist, for
the largest lists of subscriptions to
Watson’s Magazine. The first prize
is SSO, second prize $25, third prize
$lO, and three prizes of five dollars
each. We have a number of entries
for this contest, but the lists, so far,
are not formidable, and any active
agent could start now and beat the
best list we have.
Now is the time to take orders for
the Watson books. We are offering
liberal commissions. Write for our
special terms to agents on “Foreign
Missions Exposed”.
