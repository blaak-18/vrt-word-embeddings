& HER MISSION
OROTHY MERRIVALE trip
ped along Michigan avenue
with a happy, little, swing-
D
ing gait. She walked like a
child in grown-up clothes, and
switched along with all the impor
tance of one. The crisp breeze from
the lake made her pink cheeks pinker
and her curly golden hair fluffier.
The rosy mouth was set in a firm
line and held there.
“No, Tom, no. I don't want to
hear it. I don’t care for matriomny
or flats or—or you—in that way, I
mean. My thoughts are on other
things.”
“What things?”
“Politics.”
“Huh?”
“Yes, politics. I am now on my
way to call upon the chairman of the
National Committee.”
The young man stopped in the
middle of the sidewalk and stared.
“Why—what—what are you going
to do that for?”
“To submit to him the plans of
the Young Woman’s Sociological So
ciety and request his co-operation.”
The bewildered Tom shook his
head. “I don’t understand.”
“The Young Woman’s Sociological
Society is an organization formed for
the study of public questions. We
have now a firm grasp of the princi
ples of government and we shall here
after devote our services to the work
of purifying the polls and preventing
illegal voting. We shall also dictate
a certain line of conduct for politi
cians that will tend to ennoble poli
tics. After much thought and re
search we have evolved a means by
which these reforms can be enacted.
The National Committee will be ask
ed to incorporate our ideas into their
campaign, making them an issue.”
“Rather nervy—butting into a Na
tional Committee.”
“The time has come when women
must take decisive steps—must be
brave and carry their cause to the
high powers. The reason we have
never received political recognition
is because we have only talked. Now
we shall do. In England, women are
beginning to assert themselves vigor
ously—”
“They put them in jail over there,”
said Tom hopefully.
Dorothy ignored him. “It is the
psychological moment. If we seize
it women will for all time have an
established place in the management
of civil affairs. It is campaign year.
The work as designed by the Socio
logical Society will be taken up by a
National Committee, swept into
power with them and —”
“Suppose this committee is beaten.
You’d better see the chairman of
each committee and be on the safe
side. Or, better still, cut it out al
together, come and have lunch with
me and we’ll gO'.out to Oak Park and
look at flats. I have the day off.”
“Don’t mention flats to me. I am
not interested. Domestic affairs bore
me. I intend to live the larger,
freer life out in the world where peo
ple do things. Participation in po
litical affairs’ gives a woman poise
and independence. It removes her
from the petty odds and ends of life
and makes her views broader. She
becomes a unit of American progress.
I shall not marry ever, but if I do I
shall marry some man who believes
that a woman’s true sphere is not a
flat and dishwashing.”
“We’ll keep a girl.”
“I shall not discuss domestic mat
ters with you.”
Tom was snubbed into silence un
til they reached the building in which
the headquarters of the National
Committee were located.
“I’ll wait for you,” he offered,
“and hear about your interview.”
In the vast building a porter di
rected her to a door over which hung
two mammoth portraits draped with
American flags. Beyond the door an
ebon Chesterfield bowed before her.
“Is the chairman in?”
“He is not in the city.”
“Who is in charge?”
“There are several gentlemen. If
the lady will tell me her errand I
shall take great pleasure in direct
ing her to the proper department.”
“I am the representative of the
Young Woman’s Sociological So
ciety.”
“Ah, yes. Fourth door to your
right. Ask for Mr. Cole.”
The door was opened by a young
man, tall, black eyed and beautiful.
Mr. Cole was out, but the office, she
was assured, was at her disposal and
Mr. Cole would soon be in.
She sat down and looked around
her. She was in a place where men
were trying to elect a President and
she was greatly impressed. The room
was a large, comfortably furnished
business office, evidently the ante
room of a suit. The man who had
admitted her was the only occupant,
but from the rooms beyond came the
click of typewriters and the voices of
many clerks.
The young man sat down before a
large and imposing desk and began
to glance over important looking pa
pers. Occasionally he frowned and
shook his head or nodded approving
ly. After a few minutes he pushed
the papers aside and turned to his
visitor.
He told her how hard and nerve
racking it is to run a national cam
paign, of the trials and tribulations
that must be borne by the man who
gives his days and nights, his brain’s
power and his heart’s blood for the
sacred cause; that the real workers
are the men whose names are not on
the letterheads of the committee. He
outlined the policy of the committee
and told her —because she was un
deniably a young woman of intelli
gence and discretion —the prospective
projects and strategems of the com
mittee.
As he talked she realized that she
was listening to one of the mighty
ones of the earth, that the pilot of
a great poiltical party was unfolding
to her the schemes by which a na
tion was to be won and ruled.
She told him the object of her
visit. His interest was intense, so
intense that he rose and closed the
door between the room and the busy
offices beyond as if the noise disturb
ed her story.
Under the charm of a pair of dark
Jeffersonian

eyes the proposed work of the So
ciological Society became a nation
wide force for the betterment of con
ditions, and women—and one young
woman especially—took their right
ful places in the world of intellect.
The common things of daily living
were far away, too prosaic, too prov
inical for consideration.
“This matter shall be taken up
by the Executive Committee,” he
said with the seriousness demanded
by so important an announcement.
‘l’ll call a special at once. But first,”
he placed his hand over hers, “I must
have a kiss.”
Dorothy jumped to her feet and
away from his outstretched arms.
“Don’t touch me you brute —
you—”
“What’s the matter?” broke in a
new voice.
A short, heavy-set man with a
strong, heavy face had come in.
“What’s the matter?” he repeated.
“Is this lady calling on you?”
“Indeed I’m not. I came to see
Mr. Cole on a matter of business and
this man—”
“Got too fresh, did he?” He turn
ed to the younger man. “Clear out,”
he snapped, “and don’t show up
again around this place.”
The man vanished.
“Allow me to apologize for any
discourtesy you may have received,”
said the newcomer with dignified
kindliness. “I am Mr. Cole. That
man is a hanger on about the place,
put on the pay-roll because his uncle
once delivered a precinct. I regret
the annoyance he has caused you.
What can I do for you?”
“Nothing, sir. I wanted —I need
ed a little information and —I think
I got it.”
The official looked at her curiously.
The rosy color had gone out of her
face and her lips drooped a little,
but she was still very pretty.
“Anything in my power—” began
the perplexed official.
“There is nothing, sir. Good-bye.”
Tom was waiting for her at the
elevator. He asked no questions.
None were necessary.
“Come on to lunch,” he said joy
fully, “and then we’ll go out to Oak
Park and look at those flats.”
SEED AND MILLING WHEATS.
The Schooley Co., of Hagerstown,
Maryland, whose announcement ap
pears on another page, is one of the
oldest firms in the country. They
have been in the grain trade over
fifty years. They have made a close
study of the lands of North and
South Carolina, Georgia and Ala
bama, and they have found that the
wheat which is raised on the Trenton
limestone soils of Washington Coun
ty, Maryland, is the best adapted for
planting in those states, and the best
wheat in the world for flour. If any
of our farmers are thinking of put
ting in wheat this year, it will pay
them to write to the Schooley Co.,
and get the benefit of their experi
ence.
The Standard Oil Co. has placed
on the market a product called pe
troleum butter. Please excuse us.—
