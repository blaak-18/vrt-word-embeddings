My ohl hands tremble sore,
And Polly, who used to help, dear heart,
Lies t'other sî*le of the floor.

I couldn't, Hiiiokii to-day,

And don't know what, to say.
It's loi;esoiiie-in the house here,
And lonesome nut o'door—
I never knew what I oiicmoiiiu meaatr
In all my life before.
The bees go hiinimitig the whole day lonj;,
And the lirst, June rose has blown : '
And I am eighty, dear Lord, to day,
Too old to be left alone !

And threw the steam iswav.
Hilt she, sweet, thrifty soul bent down,
And planted it where she stood ;
" Dear, maybe the flowers are liviiic," sho
said,
Asleep in | hin bit of wood."
[ can't rest, dear—can not rest ;
Let the ohi man have his ivill
And wander from porch to garden post—
I lie house is so deathly still ;

She has left, ajar for me—
We had jjot so used to each other dear,
So used to each other you see.
Sixty years, and sr> wise and good,
^ She made me n better man ;
From the moment I kissed her fcif, yonnfj
Our lovers' life began.
And seven tine boys she has given me
And out of the seven not. one
Bur the noblest father in all the hnnl
Would be proud to call Iiis son.

And four good men beside; *

lie had been long sullet ing from n<r„o
and his case is cited in medical hook«
as one ot a man who died of a<oio
while our warehouses were umunlii"
with I ernvian hark, which we did not
know how to use. During this illness
be became so depressed and débilita,
ted that he would allow no barber to
come near him ; mid his heard in

it lay until, alter the Restoration, ifc
was taken out of his grave, as were al
so the bodies of Iroiou (Cromwell's
son in law) and Rradshaw ; the latter
as president of the High Court of Jus,

death on Charles I. 'Phe three bodies
were taken in carts to the Heg Lion, it.
