FC R CONGRESS, 4TH DISTRICT.
HON. J. B. ELAM,
Of DeSoto.
FOR THE STATE SENATE.
Natchitoches Parish presents
M. J. CUNNINGIH %M ESQ.,
subject to the action of the Pleasant Hill
Convention.
For Sheriff.
We are authorized to announce L. A.
DERLIEUX as a candidate For 8herif,
subject to nomination by the Democratic
Convention of this parish.
Democratic Taxation.
We hear, every now and then,
some one say, "I have been told that
taxes are higher now in this parish
than in Radical days." Some good
men are repeating this story without
taking the trouble to inquire whether
it is true or not. We present below
a statement of taxes taken at random
from the tax collector's office, which
will be found to embrace exactly the
same rates of taxation as all pay.
This statement is one of hundreds,
and can be verified by an examina
tion of the notice of every taxpayer.
Radical taxation runs in this state
ment from 1871 down to, and inclu
ding 1876; for the first levy of parish
taxation made by the Democrats was
this year, and upon the rolls of 1877.
The statement is as follows :
E. W. Dowden,
Valuation of property $100.
1871, State tax 21j mills $2,15
Parish " 20 " 2,00 $4,15
1872, State " 141 " 1,40
Parish " 45 " 4,50
School " 2 " 20 $6,15
1873, State " 144 " 1,45
Parish" 65 " 6,50 $7,95
And right here the Democracy rose in
their sovereign might and drove out
the Radical plunderers, and by the
force of the people compelled Ae re
duction to
1874, State tax 14# $1,45
Parish " Id 1,45 $2,90
1875, the same.
1876, the same.
The VINDICATOR pointed out often
during 1875 and 76, that notwith
standing the reform promises of the
Radicals their officials had stopped
dead still at the amount to which the
Democrats, not in political power,
had reduced, by force, taxation in
1874. Nay. We can prove that du
ring the interregnumn from 1874 to the
fall of 1876, that the issue of parish
paper, which is a debt against the
parish, was over $20,000 beyond their
estimate of expenses, whicl was bas
ed on a 141 mills parish taxation. In
other words, the Radicals reduced
taxation, when they were forced to
do so from fear of a "short shift and
a good rope," to 141 mills, but con
tinued to spend the same amount of
money for the people they had squan
dered under a twenty mill tar.
Now, we come down to the one
year of Democratic taxation, and
their one and a half year of ezpendi
ture, and make the contrast:
DEMOCRATIC LEVY.
Doe den,
Valuation of Property $100.
lo, t, State tax 13 mills $1,30
Parish " 74 " 75
Total $2.05
Lowest Badical taxation (1876,) $2,00
Democratie taxation 1877, .. 2,05
Democratic reduootion :.85
Highest Radical taxation (1873) $7,95
Democratic taxation 1871' 2,05
Democratic reduction $5,90
This completely explodes the re
ports of thee haditeds whoare circu
lating the story that Democratic tax
ation is greater than IBdical taxation.
14mooratic tafuels hi this parish, af
ter one and a half ysears trial of the
party, is neary per centlower than
ite lowest Radical taxation, and over
three hudred per ceut lower than tl e
highest taatios of *. Rird iis.

Mlob Law.
Our city contemporaries, notably
the Picayune and Bee, indulge in well
meant protests against mob law. We
perfectly agree with them in their I
strictures, but beg to call their at
tention to an evil which mnst be cured
before we canl hope to be entirely rid
of Judge Lynch and his efforts.
Louisiana has suffered for some
years past from too much law and
not enough justice. Known crimi
nals have been brought to book,
abundant evidence of their crimes
has been adduced, and they have been
acquitted by the hundreds, or else, if
convicted on first trial, Attorneys
have evaded justice by qnimks and
quibbles worthy of the old Bailey.
This has gone on until the mass of
well disposed people think that the
whole criminal jurisprudence is a
mockery.
It was so here until our present
Judge came on, and much to the re
lief of all good people quibbling was
put dowi in such a manner and; with
such remarks from the learned Judge
that that sort of judicial nonsense is
hardly ever repeated.
One of the criminals hung at Mon
roe by this mob, had evaded sentence
and punishment for a crime which it
was proven he committed, on a quib
ble of the vilest sort. This was
sprung in this instance, as in all
others, to gain time, during which to
run off witnesses and suppress evi
dence.
Mobs are becoming frequent be
cause the criminal jurisprudence in
this State has been "doctored" until
the chances in favor of a criminal are
ninety-nine in a hundred, and justice
has in most instances become a by
word.
When the laws are stripped of the
bristling escapes they present for
criminals, and are so arranged that
the guilty will meet sure punishment,
we may look for less mobs. not be
fore.
Major E. A. Buare.
The Democratic party has done
well in selecting this gentlemen as
its standard bearer for the approach
ing election. Few men in Louisiana
are more widely known than Major
Burke, and none have rendered great
er service to the State and his people
than he. Prominent in his efforts at
all times to drive from our soil Radi
calism and its cohorts, the party of
the people, the Democratic party,
has done but its duty in rewarding
the gallant dervices of Major Burke
with this honorable nomination.
The VINDIcATOR and Natchitoches
parish thought, and yet believe, that
Major John C. Moncure should have
been selected, but we, as it seems
all othere did, selected Major Burke as
our second choice.
The Baton Rouge Convention has
met, acted and adjourned-it now be
comes our duty to close ranks under
the gnldance of our selected leader
and banner bearer, and move on to
pre-ordained and certain victory.
Natchitoches pledges to Buike and
the Democratic ticket a good round
majority.
Constitutional Convention.
The measure of all others which de
manded the action of the Convention at
Baton Rouge, was the question or calling
a Constitutional Convention by the next
Legislature, and we are gratified that
Sthat duty has not been neglected.
We felt assured that the Democracy of
this State would never, by act or deed.
endorse the Bayonet edict of 1868; nor
in-any manner sanction a policy which
tended Id the remotest degree to give
life and vitality to principles, so utterly
repugnent to American liberty, as those
enunciated in that instrument.
The amendments propoeed by the last
Legislature, meet, as a natural conee
quence, condemnation. Their defeat
from the first was a foregone con
clusion, because, (1st) they failed
to accord that relief denianded; be
caanse, (2d) they sanctioned both the man.
nor of theadoptron of. the Constitution
of 1868, and the vicion, principles enun
-diate'therein, ad bcanW, (3d) the right
to abrogate or alter organic law is a
sovereign prerogative which the people
will never yield" to any unauthorized
body.
Let the people stand now in perfect

The Business Men of New (trloanls.
'1'o the gentlemel) comil,,,ping I h,'
above named cltss of ou pJOpllaticnl,
it hal, lutg been lr purpose to ad -
d'ess a few W011' of adviec.
Tl'hose of u, ~I, h tilCe i the
country parishes hi\ve heen for a li n.
time under the im1pto1(,sion tlih; a
large number of tim "busile, ins l
of the City had a direct interest in
bad government. We have been
sttengthened in this opinion by their
action on every occasion %i here a di
rect issue has been made between
principle and corruption. The mass
of the ''"Bsiness Interest" has been
found arrayed on the side of the bad.
They floated Warnloth's and Kel
logg's government by readily dis
counting their Bonds and Scrip.
They broke down John McEnery,
the honest people's Govemnor, under
the plea that strife would ruin their
interests.
They threatened Gen. Ogden at the
moment of his collision in September
1874, which collision did result
in the fatal blow to lRadicalismn
in Louisiana, with dire vengeance if
he did not immediately retire with
his White League.
They petitioned thousanld strong
against Kellogg's impeachment for
crimes and misdemeauois, by the
House of Representatives in 1876,
and gave him and his crew moral
support in the fight which resulted in
our defeat.
That same year they furnished
Packard, before the Gibson Commit
tee, with certiflcates'of character,
when his hands were red with the
blood of our heroes, and rendered it
of the utmost difficulty for us to de
feat his election.
These are the merest shadow of
their sins befiore Radicalism went
down. Since they have been eqnally
as guilty of gross crimes against the
people and good government.
They began theit efforts early in
the administration of Governor Nich
oils. Beginning with the sele;tion of
Tax Collectors for the country par
ishes, in defiance of their will and
petition, these "business men of New
Orleans" ended by signing, in large
numbers and at the instigation of the
Lottery and other monopolies, a re
monstrance to the legislature against
an honest Constitution.
These are sins enough, and they do
not include near all that could be
enumerated, to awake in the "coun
try people" a lively if not bitter op
position to those peculiar "business
interests," which seem to flourish so
well in corrupt times and throoghl
corrupt agencies.
The great majority of New Orleans
is patriotic and loyal to honor and
pare rule. They must, however, teach
those business men, who are ever
ready to back any species of tascality,
and submit to any amount of bad
government 0so their Opportunity to
gather in the cent per cent is not in
terrupted, a lasting lesson.
r The country people are at that
point where they are determined to
resist these gentry in foture, and we
warn them to confine themselves to a
study of the interest of thle wchole
people of this State, and to at once
divest their minds of the fallacy that
they are Louisiana.
Tihe people of the country have in
terests which they propose to main
tain at all hazards.

other 8 had been added, thle proper
definition of the writer of the effo

A. S. takes to task those who ob

arraignment of those gentlemen who
voted against that measure.is as vul
-gar in language as it is illiterate in
Sstyle. A. 8. is a classical blackguard.
He refers us to thle Odes of Horace,
and in doing so, clothes the refereneeu
in the worst spelled English we ever
saw. A. 8. you wrote your own eon

you used to give publicity to your

Sset you down at once, as one of that
Sclass of human vipers to which you
charge these gentlemen who oppose
the quarantine tax belong-cowards.
Is there a man of moral courage
who would seek reparation as you
have? No. Such has always been
the mark of the meanest and baset
of.mankind.. A. 8. you are so ASS.

U'pon tlhe te~tihuony of experts ill
printing the Grand Jury believe that
in this book, for which chai ge is titus
made, under the paragraph 2, section
10, act No. 49. above recited, there is
not a line 4f minioni type to be fonid;
the book being printed in long primer.

which, and heing leaded as it is, the
rolame is made to contain more than I
one-third miore ipages than if it had
been printed in the style of type ex
pressly provided for in the contract.
We would like to be informed by
this New Orleans Grand Jury what
"ex.pert" informed them that "there
was not a line of Minion type" in the
printed journals of the Assembly, and
that it was "all in Long Primer."
That "expert" was certainly pulling
the wool over Mr. Tod(ls eyes, for
our printers pronounce the type in
which these journals were printed,
and there is one now before s1S. hold
faced Minion.
If the enemies of Mr. Dupre and
the New Orleans Demloerat desire to
break down hiem and his paper, which.
in the estimation of the country peo
ple of Louisiana, is the best English
newspaper that has been published in
the city since the war. they must
seek other and fairer ieans to effeict
it than such stuff as the Grand Jury
was made to swallow.
There are a certain class of jonr
nalistic jack snipes in New Orleans,
and we miake this statement upon the
authority of one of the oldest and
bhet journalists in New Orleans, who
arrogate to themselves the whole
field and talent necessary to run a
newspaper in that city. Nay. Our
esteemed friend informed us, that
these men thought Horace Greeley
and Chas. A. Dana, perfect nincom
poops in journalism compared to
themselves. Ever since the Democrat
was born, these fellows have endeav
ored to break it down; a thousand
charges have been made, met and
refuted, and now some fellow has
"played" with the Grand Jury and
made thenim mniake fools of themselves
by "reporting" bold faced Minion
type as long piimer, and that the
Democrat had cheated the State to
ilthe extent of about eight hundred
dollars.
Messrs. Janin, Auguistin, ])upre
and Hearsey, are honorable, chival
rous Southern gentlenen, and no
man in Louisiana, outside the ceass
pool in which those jolrnialigtic gods,
I who are trying to btak down their
paper, wallow, can ever be made to
believe that they took one siglle cent
t fron the State to wlrhicdl tlhel Iere not
justly eltitled.
We know the gentlemen to be far
above such trash as seem to control
other city dailies-wliholunder chari.
ty Hospital funds-who assail mens'
character, and when called to account
refuse to fight or retract, and plead
I the baby act; and we doubt not that
dlis false elarge conies from these
fellows.
The True (lreenbaek Party.
The platform of the aggressive
democracy of Louisiana a synopsis of
which we publish this week from our
specials from New Orleans, embraces
our idea of the currency question. It
is bold and to the point and demands
just w hat the masses want and what
will tend to their amelioration.
First-The abolitiq of National
banks anld the retiring of their cur.
rency, which will be replaced with
greenbacks.
Seciit - o. more contraction of
greenbacks.
Third--The payment of all bonds
in greenbacks except where the origin
al contracys called for coin.
Fourth.-Greenbacks to be legal
tender for all dues, publio and pri
vate, and for custom duties; and
Fifth-The repeal of the ten per
cent tax on the issue of State banks.
This is the Ohio idea and we en
dorse it fully. With these as the de
clared principles of Democracy on the
currency question, greenbackers in
Louisiana, are simply 4isorgsni
zers, who will play into the hands of
the enemy and assist In the rain of
our own~ people.

'I'lhe olored ! "eople of this State
have bad a fair trial of Demlnrary,
during the past year or more. That
party has redeemed fully and with
out reservation, ever promise made
to them.
Their property, lives and liberty
have been fully protected. No effort
has been made to ''put them back in
slavery." No violence has been of
fered them in person or property.
Every facility tor the education of
their children which the whites enjoy
have been given them, and if they
are not satisfied with the universal
peace and contentment which they
now enjoy, then we can never satisfy
them. If they are not pleased with
the protection afforded; the stern and
majestic vindication of law vouch
safed and the full rights guaranteed
them under Democratic government,
then they must desire strife, anarchy
and turmoil.
Let the thinking colored man re
