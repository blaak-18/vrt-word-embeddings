it is all that can be desired. It is

On nwtion, the convintion took

A:-tr rece: s the coaumittee re
p), rt: I a : follows :
Resolved that we heartily endorse
tLhe: :ction of the St. Louis Con
vct ton of thi. People's party,
both in the construction and adop
tion of the 1l.atform as well as the
ticket nom'nate.I, and pledge our
,-nowcrvir" support thereto.
2ndl. '1 at it is the patriotic
duty of all the silver forces to
unite in this contest of the ages
ainiast tl.e allied money powers of
Europe an:l America, and that the
haranony of the silver elements can
he.-t he uihtained by the withdraw
al o; Mr. Sewall by the Democrat
ic parit. and the recognition of
that Hiero of the South, Thomas
E. Watson.
3rd. That in the face of a grave
crisis the People's party yields for
the present to another organization
the head of the ticket that will
lead to victory over the Gold Shy
locks of the b*'ast,
We ho1l that the I'Cople's party
has by its unceasing labr anti
patriotism forced these i~sues and
pledges upon the Democratic lparty,
and that our only safety de
pends upon holding intact the au
tonomy of our party organization
which aill always menace the over
throw andt destruction of those in
power who may seek to use our
Government for selfish purposes.
That the cause that has produced
such a wonderful effect at the time
when so badly needed must be pre
served as a means of self preserva
tion to our citizenship and our re- I
public.
That while the Democriey of the
United States is threatening to I
return to its former principles 1
enunciated by Jefferson and Jack j
son, we demand that Louisiana De
mocracy will return to the method
of honest e'ection.
We invite and urge the co-op- 4
peration of all ho.est and patriot
ic citizens to the successful accom
plishment of these ends.
Respectfullv submitted,

Mr. L T. Collier, Koscituo, Miss.,
says: "My bowels would act from ten
to twenty times a day, of a bloody,
mucus nature. My kidneys were very
badly out of order. I was tre.ted by
the best physicians, and they said I
could live but a short while. I then
commenced using Royal Germetuer.
In three weeks Icould eat anything,
and do as much work as ever. I con
tinued the Germetuer, and can testify
that I am entirely cured, and that
Germetuer did the work."
