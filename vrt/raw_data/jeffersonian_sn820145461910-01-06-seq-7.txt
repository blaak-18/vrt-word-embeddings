in order to secure the Catholic vote
for the party.
I wrote an article for one of our
country papers and closed with the
following, which the editor dared not
publish, for the reason that many of
his subscribers were Catholics:
“It may not be generally known
that Presidents Garfield and McKin
ley were both murdered by Catholics,
and the conspirators against Presi
dent Lincoln—Booth, Payne, Atze
rodt, Mrs. Suratt and her son were all
Catholics. The son of Mrs. Suratt
escaped, and five years later was
found in Rome, and a member of the
Pope’s guard.
“Lincoln was defended by Father
Chinnky, who had left the church and
was sued for heresy. Father Chinnky
said to Lincoln, ‘You are a marked
man. The Catholic Church will sooner
or later avenge their defeat by kill
ing you.’ Yet, in the face of all
this, two of President Roosevelt’s
Cabinet were Catholics, and Mr. Taft
has been instrumental in turning
over several millions into the Pope’s
treasury.
“One of the Catholic prelates open
ly declared that they proposed to make
this a Catholic country. Is it not in
teresting to note that a Catholic
church has been lately dedicated at
Fort Slocum, and located on the Gov
ernment reservation, with the con
sent of Roosevelt when he occupied
the Presidential chair?’’

DISPUTES “THE FIELD OF HOME
MISSIONS.”
Dear Sir: —In the November issue
of The Jeffersonian an article was
printed entitled “The Field of Home
Missions,” by Captain L. A. Odom,
of the Salvation Army. In this arti
cle many hard things are said re
garding Foreign Missions. The ob
ject of this letter is to say Captain
Odom does not reflect the views at
all of the Salvation Army, for the
Army is at work in fifty-four differ
ent countries and colonies and thor
oughly believes in Foreign Missions,
and once a year a collection is taken
up in every country where the
Army is laboring for this very pur
pose—in order to help the Army in
those countries where the work is
not self-supporting, such as the
South American republics, Italy,
and other strongly Catholic coun
tries, as well as India, the West In
dies, etc.
By publishing this letter you will
greatly oblige the Salvation Army,
which has been put in a false light
by Captain Odom’s article.
Very sincerely yours.
EDWY WHITE, Major,
Divisonal Officer for the South.
(We publish this, but Captain
Odom is right all the same.

Alabama, —where she finds all the
mission work that she can do.

Mr. Watson: —You are certainly
doing this old world good—“old
Georgia” in particular. I like your
broadsides fired at Duck, Boodle
hunter, and the rest of the Farmers’
Union wreckers. This gang is
afraid to come out in the open and
meet you. I want you to give them
hail Columbia, especially Boodle
hunter.

WANTS WATSON CLUBS.
Hon. Thomas E. Watson:—l feel
that I can with perfect safety say you
have not a more loyal friend any
where than I. When you first ex
posed the corrupt conduct of Con
gress and nobly declared yourself in
favor of the people you won my
warm admiration, and when you or
ganized the Populist party and hero
ically and courageously began the
struggle for the laboring men I sup
ported you and used my influence in
your behalf. Nothing could possibly
afford me more pleasure than to be
of service to you in any way. My
heart throbs with joy when I hear of
the organization of Watson Clubs in
various parts of the world. My heart
felt sentiment is, long live Thomas
Watson and The Jeffersonian. I am
getting old and can not do what I
would like to do for The Jeffersonian,
but my daughter sees a great many
people and will endeavor to get sub
scribers; she will not keep any com
mission.
Your sincere friend,
SARA ABBOTT.

CRITICISES THE WAY SOME
PREACHERS ARE DOING.
Dear Uncle Tom:—lt seems that
the preachers are using you rather
roughly. Making it as embarrassing
for you as possible. It seems rea
sonable to suppose that the preach
ers would be willing to give you a
fair showing. They ought to give
you the right to present your side.
Our laws allow even the foulest mur
derer this right. The man who wil
fully murdered our once much-loved
and highly honored President had
that right.
Ought not those who represent
Christ be willing to go as far as the
law? Doesn’t God’s love and jus
tice allow a man more liberty and
justice—fairness—than man’s law?
Certainly it does. If you are wholly
wrong, as they claim, would it not
put you to shame for them to show
this? If you are in error, could they
not easily prove it? Should they not
be willing to let the people know the
Ob® □effersonlan
truth? Do they not represent the
very spirit of Truth? Was not Christ
Himself “Truth?”
Why not let the people know the
Truth? Are they afraid of the peo
ple? Are they afraid to trust the
people? Will they not risk the peo
ple’s decision? “Shall the people
rule?” No, the present attitude of
the preachers says, “We will rule the
people”—by keeping them in dark
ness and ignorance. Is this dem
ocracy? Is this fair? Is this Christ
like? No; verily, no! Mr. Watson,
they are doing you a great injustice
by not publishing your side. It seems
they prefer to abuse you—calling you
a liar, traitor, etc., etc. But I be
lieve the people will yet learn the
Truth.
Fight on, Mr. Watson, you are gain
ing ground every day. Fight on, we
love you all the more. Fight on!
Fight on! thou noble and true lead
er, we follow with more courage
now! Fight on; yes, fight on!
We’re getting new recruits every
day—yes, they’re coming from the
North, South, East and West—from
the wealthy class and from the mid
dle class and from the poor class.
Fight on, most noble Tom, just a
few more years, and we will lay you
down to rest. I know you’ve been
discouraged many a time. You have
been misrepresented, falsified,
abused, mocked, etc., but men—yea,
all men—and the preachers—will
honor you some day. Fight on,
blessed leader of the poor, fight on!
Fight on; God will reward thee
abundantly. Fight on, dear Tom!
Soon your pen will be laid aside;
your tongue forever hushed; your
voice we’ll hear no more—your face
we’ll see no more.
Fight on, dear, noble Tom; fight
on! May God help you to fight on!
Fight on, for who’ll fight our battles
when you are gone? Fight on; men
may not believe you now, nor honor
you, but fight on; your great work
will never die. No, your record will
live always. Some day—some sweet
day—men, yea, all the world, will
honor you. Fight on; we can’t af
ford to give up “the ship.”
Fight on! Fight on! We love
you, and we’ll die by you.
Fight on till every foe is van
quished, and till victory is won.
Faithfully yours,
LEROY L. WRIGHT.
