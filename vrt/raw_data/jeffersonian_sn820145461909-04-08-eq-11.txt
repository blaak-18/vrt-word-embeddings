BURLEY TOBACCO SOCIETY.
(Continued from Page One.)
them from throwing their crops of
hurley on the open market.
In November of 1908 things looked
dark for the Kentucky planters. But
an overwhelming victory was within
easy reach. In this month, November,
Vice-President Smith of the Ameri
can Tobacco Co., made his appearance
in Kentucky to hold a conference with
Mr. Clarence Lebus, president of the
Burley Tobacco Society of the State.
There was also present at this confer
ence the seven members composing
the executive board of the local or
ganization, representing the best busi
ness men in the blue grass region of
Kentucky.
The outcome of the conference of
Vice-President Smith with represen
tatives of the 'Burley Tobacco Society
was an offer from the tobacco trust
to buy in the entire crop of burley
grown in 1906 at a graded price
■amounting to an average of S2O a
hundred pounds, and to take all of
the tobacco in the pool of 1907 at an
average price of sl7.
It was also the desire of the tobacco
octopus to include in its mammoth
purchase not only the large bulk, but
the entire hoarded holdings of the
Burley Tobacco Society, but to this
the league would not agree. They re
fused to part with their entire hold
ings, which would have worked a hard
ship on all independent manufac
turers, but retained a certain per cent
for the use of the independents
against the earnest appeals of those
manipulating the big deal for the
American Tobacco Company.
Some idea of the amount of money
passed can be gained by multiplying
more than 100,000,000 pounds of to
bacco by 18 cents a pound, or by
learning that 3,500 hogsheads of to
bacco were shipped out of Clarke
county alone, going to all sections of
the United States, 135 hogsheads be
ing shipped daily. It is also said by
Mr. Hunt that not less than $600,000
has and is being distributed to plant
ers in the county of Clarke alone, al
though this county ranks sixth in im
portance in proportion to the bulk of
its crop of burley tobacco among all
counties comprised in the burley belt.
Following the signal victory over
the tobacco trust, a grand blowout
and banquet was given by the officers
and members of the Burley Tobacco
Society at their headquarters at Win
chester, in Clarke county, at which
representatives from Congress, mem
bers of the bench of the Supreme
Court of Kentucky, and representa
tive citizens from all parts of the
State took a prominent part.
It is said by Mr. Hunt that the per
sonnel of members going to make up
the Burley Tobacco Society of Ken
tucky compares more than favorably
with that of the Legislature of the
State. Kentucky is wild over the vic
tory she has achieved, and the humili
ation she has brought to the Ameri
can Tobacco Company, recognized as
the mother of trusts. —Richmond

WHY LIVING IS HIGH.
Some time back The Echo had an
article in these columns on the in
creased cost of living. Below we re
produce an editorial from the Wash
ington Post telling how rapidly the
cost has increased, and how much,
and giving some cogent reasons there
for:
11 Prof. Joseph Francis Johnson of
the University of New York presents
this nut for our doctors of political
and social economy to crack: 4 lt took
$3,623 last year to pay for necessaries
of living that could be bought for
$2,500 in 1897. Sixty-nine cents ten
years ago had the buying power of
$1 of today.’
11 And the thing is growing more
threatening and more onerous for the
family with a moderate fixed income,
every day. Indeed, unless some re
lief is had the cost of living by 1911
will become double what it was in
1897. There was a disastrous finan
cial panic in 1907 that shrunk every
estate between the two oceans and
threw thousands and tens of thous
ands out of employment; but it
brought to none cheaper shelter.
•‘Your corner grocer will charge
35 cents for a shot rabbit. The man
is scarcely 50, who, as a boy, sold a
dozen trapped rabbits for 50 cents,
and made money and strengthened
health in the business. Two-score
years ago a dozen fine, fat and thifty
pullets could be had for $2. Today
one such bird will cost 75c.
“Many things worked together to
make our country great, puissant and
opulent —government founded on lib
erty; a hardy, daring and adventur
ous people; empires of virgin, fertile
and cheap lands; a salubrious cli
mate; inexhaustible stores of cheap
raw materials; labor-saving contriv
ances of the first inventive genius on
earth, and so on, and so on. But not
the least of the agencies operating to
create the America on the threshold
of the twentieth century was cheap
living, especially cheap food. That
made New York and Chicago the
world wonders they are. But there
is no longer cheap food for the subur
ban population. It is a demonstra
ted fact that the English working
man eats a cheaper breakfast than
his fellow in America, and his table
is supplied just as bountifully, if not
more so.
“Here is how it is: Nothing on the
Englishman’s breakfast table is taxed
except coffee, tea, sugar and perhaps
pepper. Everything on the Ameri
can’s table is taxed except coffee, tea
and pepper. It is a fact that your
housewife will supply twenty persons
with coffee for what a steak for one
person will cost, but when it is pro
posed to put a tax on coffee to get a
sorely needed revenue there is horror
in the land and the exclamation:
‘What! Tax the workingman’s break
fast ! ’
“The fact is that the tax now lev
ied on beef alone amounts to more at
a single breakfast than the working
man would pay in a week on coffee,
if the proposed duty were imposed on
it. And the tax on beef is for a
trust, the most oppressive of all the
octopuses.
“Our doctors of political economy
must bestir themselves if they would
not have cheap food the paramount
issue in 1910 and 1912. Everybody
knows how such an election would
go,” —Oglethorpe Eeho,
