(N. O. Times,]
The deellnlng, by Lieutenant Gov.
rmor Wilts, ofa joint political can
vas with Judge sattle, was emio
eaty propel, and I. to be commended
by al right thinking People. If
t r were questions of principle and
problems of statesmanship involved
ain this canvase, wrhteh it might be
desirable to illustrate and elucidate
before the public, there might be
some propriery in a joint discussion
of the questions nvolved, but there
is nothing of the kind on hand in
the present campaign. The struggle
Is between a people whose prosper
Ity and future welfare are at stake,
on one side, and a party which in
the past bas proved itself to be their
wort enemy, on the other.
The people, after infinite pains
Sad lose, have succeeded in wresting
control of the State from that party,
and they are not likely to hear from
Its orators anything that can recon
elle them to return to its power;
henee there is no reason why the
Democatle candidates should re
quire their followers to listen to Re
publican harangues, under the cir
cumatanees, as they would have
done by giving opportunities for
saob discusion. The Republicans
ea of course gather together their
adhereats and make speeches to
them just as much as they may
ehoose, but there is no reason the
Demoelats should put themselves
out of the way to furnish audiences
to the Republican orators.
This however is the smallest part
of the aair. The party managers
who are behind Judge Beattie and
his respectable State ticket do not
Indulge the faintest hope of carrying
the State ortheir candidates, They
are much tooastute for that. They
are looking far beyond this State
canvass to the comning presidential
empalgn of neat year, for which it
know highly important to get the
party ln training. Louisiana held
shkey to the presidential chair
three years ago, and it would be no
strae thbng if it should do so a
I from now. Moreover, any
hstpublic discussion of the meth.
rin whish the Republican party
this State has la times past, work.
ed ot ItI Polley would be calculated
tog elender bad blood and bring on
agmI personal collisioas, matters
might be useful as political
palptl at the North in the
eat preildential oampagn, but
w b to the hi hest interests
of the South to avoid, and to ex
puno from its politics. The public
olti discussions on both sides
are 1ee to all, and those who choose
to hear Judge Beattie's oratory will
Iatted his appointments. He wca*
not well desire more in the interests
otharmony.

S Thereputation it has attained, in consequence .o

public that it will continue to realize the happiest

S?" nown,whohave been restored from alarmingad
ree- even desperate diseases of the lungs, by its use.
All who have tried it,acknowledge its superiority;
and where its virtues are known, no one hesitates
:0 8 as to what medicine to cmploy to relieve the die
1030 tress and suffering peculiar to pulmonary alec
tions. CHERRY PECTRAL always affords in
stant relief, and performs rapid cures of the
able Milder varieties ofbronchlial disorder, as well as
Sit the more formidable diseases of the lungs.
As asafeguard tochildren,,amid the distress.
ing diseases which beset the Throat and Chest of
Childhood, it is invaluable; for, by its timely use,
multitudes are rescued and restored to health.
This medicine gains friends at every trial, as
the cures it is constantly producing are too roe
