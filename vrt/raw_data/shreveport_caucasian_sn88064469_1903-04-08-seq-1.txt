THE POLICE MATTER.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIEU
TENANT AND OFFICER.
A Negro Involved in the Recrimination.
Lieutenant Basch and Officer Fitz
patrick Disagree as to Facts.
On Saturday night a negro named
Williams was arrested at the Union
Depot by Officer Fitzpatrick, whom he
charged with carrying concealed weap
ons. This negro was from Ferguson,
Ark., with his wife and children, en
route to Sodus, La., where he said he
intended to buy a home. On being
searched at the station, which he
reached without having offered any op
position- to his arrest, he was searched.
as is the rule. He had on his person
over $goo. He explained as reason for
carrying the pistol that he intended to
defend himself against any attempt to
rob him. Having satisfied himself that
Williams was all right, Lieutenant
Basch, who was on duty, handed back
the money to the prisoner, who on
leaving $tTo as a deposit bond, was re
leased. He agreed to return for trial
Saturday. The action of Lieutenant
Basch was strictly id accordance with
the law. Lieutenant Basch then detailed
Otficer McKinney to go with Williams
to the Union Depot with instructions to
Fitzpatrick to see that Williams board
ed the train. Williams' pistol had been
returned to him unloaded and was-in a
basket carried by his wife. Lieutenant
Basch charges that Officer Fitzpatrick
disobeyed orders when he attempted to
re-arrest the negro who had given bond,
and that he was under the influence of
liquor. At any rate there was a lively
combat between the officer and the ne
gro, who, after having received two
blows and been knocked down, grap
pled with the officer, who received sev
eral cuts on the head and was taken to
the sanitarium for treatment. It was
believed he had been fatally hurt, but he
is doing well. The negro- fled and al
though pursued with 4egic eludet cap
ture b Trd Intins t° Pb4ti 'let ali d ft e
on a mule for which he gave the boy $5-.
When last heard from Williams was at
Sodus.
In his statement of the case Officer
Fitzpatrick denies being intoxicated or
having any whiskey about him. He
stated that the negro on his way to the
station had offered to pay him $25 to
secure his release. On reaching the de
pot-from the station, to his, inquiry how
he (the negro) had got out, that the
negro's reply was surly and that when
he (Fitzpatrick) declared that he would
again search him for that pistol, that he
was grabbed by the negro who butted
him in the stomach, secured his club,
with which he was clubbed senseless.
This is about the version of Lieuten
ant Basch and of Officer Fitzpatrick.
There are many who criticise Basch
for having released the negro, but i
law he had a right to let the man go o
bond, as the amount deposited woul
more than cover the fine which the city
court could impose, and in defense of
the lieutenant it may be said that a
white man named Bassett, of Texas, ar
rested Saturday night at the Union De
pot and charged with carrying concealed
weapons, Was tried on Monday in the
city court, and he was fined $15 includ
ing the costs.
This is an unfortunate affair, but it
should be thoroughly investigated.
UNINSTRUCTED DELEGATION.
The Opelousas Clarion says: "There
is an undercurrent for an uninstructed
delegation to the convention. It is ar
gued that an instructed delegation's
power in a convention is naught-and
it is reasonable to expect that a candi
date will make no'concessions to a dele
gation that already belongs to him. He
will save his patronage for the unin
structed.
"St. Landry has a favorite son now
holding the position of auditor of public
accounts of the Statet and St. Landry
is duty bound to see that this favorite
son is landed for a second term. Mr.
Frazee is the first man for many years
who has occupied a State office from
this parish, and his parishioners would
indeed be recreant if they should be sat
isfied with one term, especiilly when it
is a generally known fact that he ranks
with the best auditors this State ever
had. It would be showing very little par
ish pride for St. Landry to act in any
way that would do anything but held
Fraxee's chances to succeed himself.
"The Clarion is for Frazee first.
"Let everythink else stand from un
der."

"Unveil Monuments ()\ver the (;rave.
of Departed Brothers.
"Sunday afternoon Broad Ax camp.
\Woodmen of the WorlIl. a.isted be thei'
nulmbers of Sand Beach and Maple
canlps hehld a grand ceremonylt\ at the
Sprague '.streel cenmetery. I"he fnt-iie
was the unveiling of tw\\o mionuments t
deceased meiiimbers of the camp and the
exercises were of thle imot ilictresting
character.
"The joint camps of the \Woodmen,
headed by Rettig's hand, marched from
the hall of Maple canlp to tile cemetery,
a number of ladies of the \Voodmclen
circle being in line in carriages.
"Arriving at the grave, of the de
ceased solvereigns sweet Iiiii ,ic was rt
dered by a quartette of choppers, ld Iy
Brother Parker of Broad Ax cannp.
Sovereign J. Ilenry Shepherd then de
livered a feeling oration over the gravec
of the deceased, ini which he paid a high
tribute to the memory of the ldearted
antl the beautiful cuistomi of the Wood
mien of perpetuating tile memory of the
departed memnbers by this erecticn of
beautiful monuments.
"The ceremonies were brought to an
end by a selection of vocal nmusic by the
W\oodmen quartette and the canlps
marched backl to their mlceetig rooms."
As you will note it is peculiar and it
is not what a polished French gentle
man would style a "c/if d'curt'r"-in
English, a rare lit. It nmay he said that
this report o(f an event which was in
teresting to hundreds and thousanids of
people in Shreveport is misleading and
incorrect. Two monitments were imi
veiled, hbut there is no mention of the
names of the deceased to whom these
tokens of love in marble were dedicated.
The report should have stated that the
monuments were erected to the menwry
of W. W. Caperton and Jos. Laenger.
' The -latdikes^ -f -The Wodixhien "circle
were not "in line in carriages" htit were
in waiting at the celnetery.
There was no "feeling oration over
the graves of the deceased." whose
graves are almost at the extreme cll
of the cemetery, hut the orati n of Sov
ereign J. Henry Shepherd folowed the
solemn rites at each grave, at which' the
sextette led by Brother L. Parker dis
coursed in touching, feeling strain sa
cred selections, and with this splendid
oration front a gallery platform there
was closed an event which impressed
dee ly the vast throng of ladies and
gentlemen (not Woodmen), an "event
which merited, in public print, more
than a passing notice nearly two days
ifter its occurrence. Respectfully,
BROADAXE.
April 7.
It is evident that "Broadaxe" has no
appreciation of the report, and we may
explain. There was no reporter any
where about, and having heard of the
unveiling ceremony it was natural that
something be said even thirty-six hours
after the happening. It was an "off-hand
effort" such as are frequently "worked
off" from the sanctum sanctorum. "Off
hand efforts" are all right if guaged ac
curately. but a mess when they are fired
without regard to facts.
We may explain with a story. Some
years ago when the editor of the Cau
casian was local news grinder for the
Times, there should have been held on
a fixed date, in the Eighth Ward of
Caddo parish, a big Democratic rally at
which several of the big oratorial guns
were programmed. for speeches, but ow
ing to a sudden and heavy local storm,
wind, thunder, lightning and rain which
continued until dark, there was no rally.
The news grinder could not attend, and
the opposition man had been left. The
then Times grinder having determined
on "doing up" the opposition sheet, sat
himself down on a handy half barrel
and detailed in his most felicitous style
the rally of the day, with excerpts from
the orators "accentuated" and "'punctu
ated" in appropriate places with vocif
erous applaud, etc., etc. It was after
midnight when the gem, with flaring
headlines and a rooster, was on the
press, and with a feeling of "exultant
pride" the grinder stepped around the
corner to be refreshed, when to his
amazement and good fortune he met
several of the orators who were busy
cleaning mud lumps from their throats
- stimulating." When the grinder real
ized the all-powerful truth he (lid not
tarry for refreshments, and alInst in a
