LETTERS T'UQTI THE PEOPLE
OLD POP OVERHAULS A
HOKEITE EDITOR.
Editor Quitman Advertiser. Dear
>ir: Os course you will give space in
your piper to a friend and admirer
of the Hon. Thomas E. Watson, to
reply to your criticism of that gentle
man in last week’s issue of your pa
per under the heading: “You have
done well, Governor Smith.”
Now Mr. Editor, you know that it
is a generally conceded fact that the
I ruth half told is the foulest kind of
falsehood. Then why was it that you
did not tell the whole truth? But in
stead you perverted it with the truth
half told. And in a wilful and
malicious manner stab Mr. Watson in
he back.
Why was it that you dared not open
your slander trap while Mr. Watson
was in Quitman? If you say that
you did not have the opportunity you
would be guilty of uttering another
half truth. You were present and
easily could have asked Mr. Watson
to explain why he did not support
your Idol for a second term. If Mr.
Watson’s explanation was not satis
factory to your exquisite mind: I am
going to forestall your answer, for I
know that you will dodge and quibble.
Therefore what? You were afraid to
think of such a thing, much less speak
of it. You know that, while Mr. Wat
son was in Quitman. you and your co
partners in the Brooks county social
equality circular, tried to be real
chummy with Mr. Watson and ns old
pops. But true to your nature as
soon as Mr. Watson left town you
betook yourself to your armory.
Editorial Sanctorum, and unlimbered
your biggest gun and forthwith pro
ceeded to shell the woods. Oh, what
a brave soldier you are! You try to
make it appear that because Watson
did not support Smith was the reason
Smith was defeated. But Smith said
(or the Atlanta Journal said for him)
very soon after his election that he
could have done equally as well —or
better —without Watson’s or the Pop
ulists’ help. Again, Smith said in
the last race:
“I don’t care anything about Tim
Watson, I have won all his following,
and shall bury Watson so deep this
time that yon won’t hear of him
again.” So now, Mr. Editor, you see
you give Hoke the half truth ev
ery time you say Watson bad any
thing to do with Hoke’s defeat,
and now, Mr. Editor, before I forget
it. I will give you some of the
reasons why Joe Brown beat Hoke
Smith for Governor in this,
Brooks, county. The social equality
circular that was circulated by the
Hokeites, did the work, had it not
been for that dirty work Hoke would
have carried this county, and it is
generally conceded that it had its
effect all over the State. That circular
coupled to such political thieves as
Boykin Wright, and Hoke’s strong
desire for self aggrandizement w’as
too big a load for your Bullgine to
pull over the red hills of North and
middle Georgia, to say nothing of our
South Georgia sands. Your dirty
flings at Tom Watson only tend to
carry you deeper into the cesspool of
political treachery. You say it was
Mr. Watson who took the back track
and not Hoke Smith. You forget that
one hundred and ten thousand Geor
gians said to the contrary. You for
got that the whole truth is against
you. You have forgotten that once
upon a time you were courting Popu
list help to elevate you to the honored
place of representative of this county,
and that a large per cent of the Old
Pops supported you. This is the way
you are paying them for that much
needed help, is it? Please remember
that it is written, “He that sows to
the wind shall reap the whirlwind.”
It has been said of old time, that
“wise men change their minds but
fools never do.” Then it stands to
reason that, if Clark Howell and
Editor Pendleton are now pulling
little Joe’s gubernatorial ear like
yoke fellows with Tom Watson as
driver, they are the wise men. Now’
where does that leave you? Hadn’t
you better get w’ise? But I remem
ber that you too, like you say about
Watson having a grievance against
Boykin Wright, have a grievance
against Clark and Charlie, here they
are. Clark Howell showed Hoke
Smith up in his true light in the
memorable campaign of 1905-1906.
And Charlie Pendleton, why, he sat
down on you, and your puny lit
tle paper. So hard, oh, so hard!
Listen wdiile I rehearse. The
Macon Telegraph Sunday morning.
August 16, 190 S, contains the follow
ing under the heading O, come off!
Mr. W. T. Gaulden, “Box 216, Quit
man, Ga. 1908,” under date of
August 12, sends us a carbon copy of
a letter w’ith the Telegraph’s address
prefixed neatly, but in another color,
which shows that ive are not the sole
recipient of this favor. It reads as
follows: Dear Sir: Enclosed you will
find an editorial in the Quitman Ad
vertiser in its last issue. I think it
is strong and timely, and as it may
have escaped your notice, I clip it and
send it to you thinking that you might
use it in your paper and make some
favorable comment upon it on your
editorial page. Pardon me for the
liberty I take and let my loyalty to
the cause of the Democrats atone for
my mistake, if I have made any in
sending you this article.
Yours truly,
W. T. GAULDEN.
And here is what Charlie Pendleton
said in reply: “'The heavy editorial
which presses down upon Mr. Gaul
den ks mental apparatus is short and
under a black headline which declares
that there is “A real cause for
alarm.” No sham this time, boys;
this is the “real” thing because “the
reactionaries have captured the State,
and the machinery of the party having
again fallen into their hands, the
action of the National Democratic
party in renominating Bryan is
being largely repudiated by them.
Do tell' Th’s is a piece of the cloth
out of which was cut the “Brooks
county social equality circular” of
last spring. It has the same smell
about it and animosity which is
calculated to estrange Democrats (if
ZSfye Jeffersonian
it has any effect at all) rather than
to bring them together. There were
110,000 of those so-called “reaction
aries.” All white, no wool, but a
yard and a half wide, fruit of loom,
Georgia cotton, no “storm” or
“dogfail” about it. Mr. Gaulden
should forget it, and swing himself
around to the sunny side. There you
have it. There is the reason you
couple Pendleton and Clark to Joe’s
wagon, with Watson as driver. You
are the man with a grievance. Better
take Pendleton’s advice. You hate
Tom Watson, and you know’ that you
can *t cope with him, you dare not
come out in the open and attack him.
You know 7 that he would do for you
as he has done for others who have
been silly enough, to assail him in the
past, squelch you. Unlimber your gun
and shell the wood some more. Blow’
your fog horn to your heart’s content.
But remember that when the carcases
of Tom Watson’s political enemies are
lost to memory, lie forgotten in the
trash piles of political corruption
buried in the upheavals that are rap
idly approaching, the name and
fame of Hon. Thomas E. Watson will
live in song and story —will live in
the hearts of unborn generations as
the historian who wrote history, the
statesman whose statute carries the
daily mails into every rural home in
the country and safety to every man
who couples cars. Yes, sir, Watson
has come back and ere long he is
coming to stay, The Quitman Adver
tiser to the contrary notwithstanding.
Yours truly,
G. B. CRANE.
HISTORY OF DEMOCRATIC RULE.
Tolbert. Texas. R. F. I). 2.
The Memphis Weekly Commercial-
Appeal of Sept. 22, has a lengthy
editorial on “Shall the People Rule”?
in which our notion is compared, in
that respect to the people’s rule in
Russia, and Mexico. The editorial
closes with an appeal to the people to
support the Denver platform, saying
“The people can rule if they unite
in supporting the Denver platform
and the Democratic candidates.”
The history of the Democratic rule
is too fresh on the minds of a very
large portion of Texans to let the
Appeal’s appeal have any effect on
them. We have not yet forgotten
how completely Wall Street national
Rankers and the Sugar Trust ruled
the last Democratic administration.
We haven’t yet forgotten that it was
a Democratic administration that
crowned the Republican efforts to put
this country on a gold basis.
We have long since learned that
Democratic platform promises are
made to get in on, and then for
gotten.
We still remember that the Dem
ocratic platform of 1884 declared:
“We believe in honest money, the
gold and silver coinage of the Consti
tution and a circulating medium con
vertible into such money without
loss,” and how the coinage of silver
w\as slaughtered to appease the wrath
of a few Wall Street National Bank
Presidents.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Democratic party has ever declared
itself a friend to silver, when it Was
seeking office, the first time, since
1856, the people put their trust in it,
and gave it a ch'ance, it betrayed that
trust; and right on the heels of this
Ihe Democratic National plat form of
1888 says: “Upon its record thus
exhibited and upon the pledge of a
continuance to the people of the bene
fits of good government, the National
Democracy invoke a renewal of popu
lar trust by the re-election of a Chief
Magistrate who is faithful, able and
prudent.” Whom was he faithful to?
The Sugar Trust, National Bankers
and the Rothschilds’ bond buyers.
M hen Mr. ('leveland took charge of
the Government’s affairs in 1593, he
found the people in a prosperous con
dition. See his first message to the
53rd Congress. set the country
experienced one of the worst panics
that year that we usually have to
contend w’ith. During his last ad
ministration, Mr. Cleveland did all he
could against silver coinage and the
then outstanding Greenbacks. But
still, he had the indorsement of the
Democratic party as one “who is
faithful, able and prudent.”
How much better recommendation
has Mr. Bryan now? None. How much
more can the common people expect
of h m than they got from Mr. Cleve
land? None. Whom will Mr. Bryan
serve if elected? The very same
class that Mr. Cleveland served. If
the Trusts had any confidence in Mr.
Bryan’s pretension to make it impos
sible for them to exist in the United
States, do you, Mr. Reader, suppose
that they would be trying io elect
him ?
The Commercial-Appeal speaks of
Senator Foraker as ‘‘A Fallen
Angel.” What could it say of its own
dear Senator Bailey? I would sug
gest to the Appeal that it clean up its
own Democratic record before it
criticises that of some one else whose
record is no worse than that of its
own.
If the people ever rule they will
have to do so through some party
other than either the Republican or
Democratic, and multiplied thousands
of them know. it. The number of
democrats (so called) who never
scratched that ticket, who will do so
this fall in Texas, is legion. Well
posted, nn-to-date, thinking farmers
are begining to see (some of them a
long time ago) that neither the Re
publican nor Democratic party means
anything to them, and they mean to
quit supporting either of them.
How much of the “Root of all
evils” idol has the Commercial-Ap
peal that it will put up as a forfeit
. that the people will actually rule if
Mr. Bryan is elected? Would be glad
to know to what extent the Appeal
will be willing to vouch for its party
to do what it promises to do.
W. T. FLOWERS.
Mr. Bryan will have to make < nt a
better case for his claim under the
will of the people than he did for Lis
claim under the will of Philo S.
Bennett.—New York Tribune.
