ABE WEI IN THE UNION?
The northwest seems to favor
David Bennett IIll of New York,
and Mayor Tom L Johnson of Cleve
land, Ohio, as the Democratic candi
dates for president and vice-president
in 1904. For second place, Tom
Johnson is all right, but the "solid"
South is getting tired of furnishing
the *vot.e and getting none of the
"pie" It we have not now "purged"
oorselves of "rebellion," we never
will, and if we are "in" the Union we
want to know st.-Panola, Tex,
Watehman,
"We" are in the Union with a big
U and "don't-you-forget;' in the
Union to contribute to the support of
the government, "the old lag" and an
"appropriation," but whenever "we"
would venture to intimate, or inusa
uate seriously that "we~ desired to be
a president or a V P of the United
btate, there would be instantly
turned loose from the northwest and
the north the old familiar cry: "Reb
elve'-"States lately in Rebellion"
"copperheads"-"suake eaters"-"dis
loyal to the Uniou"--until a man of
stone would become paralyzed. No,
there is greater opportunity for the
Panola Watchman man to go to
Heaven than "to ever warming" the
presidential seot, as the High.
Muckee-Muck or the V P of the
United States.
The South should be content to
have the privilege of being permitted
to live and not tall into the hands of
Congress and be Porto Ricoized.
The Panola Watchman man says
pathetieally, "if we have not now
'purged' ourselves of 'Rebellion' we
never will," and we are sorry, very
sorry that he has permitted himself to
to unnecessarily "purged." Do like
"us," never mind David B Hill, or
Tom Johnson or any other man. Turn
the whole presidential business loose,
let her go Gallagher and stand from
under.

CHILDISH GOSSIPS.
The Dreaded Sesadal Meager beelas
Her Career Ia the Nursery.
The child Is the father of the man,
so the proverb runs, but altered to "the
girl is the mother of the woman" It
would be even more true. The other
day I came home from an afternoon
tea thoroughly disgusted. The entire
conversation had been gossip and fault
finding-servants, neighbors, husbands.
It was all the same thing. I could not
bring away one single Improving
thought, one wise or witty saying.
Just as I was about to egter the nurs
ery I heard my small daughter's voice
raised In an eager whisper. "It's a se
cret. Margie, and you must pwomise
you won't tell." I could hear Margery
gasp with excitement. "Hope I'll die if
I do!" she muttered in the same stage
whisper. "Well, then," cried the small
Informer "what d'you fink? Judy
cheated dis morning! I sawed her!"
At this moment I entered the room.
The whole episode reminded me un
pleasantly of Mrs. Binks' confidences
at the house I had just left. These
confidences Involved the reputation of
a neighbor. "But of course this is
strictly confidential, my dear," she
whispered, and of course she had told
the same thing to 20 others, and before
nightfall every one In town would
know.
I took one of the small sinners on
each knee and spoke long and earnestly
an the subject
of talking about
people behind
their backs. "It
is like stabbing
them in the
dark!" I ex
plained, and( I
think they both
understood.
Oh. these se
erets, these con
idences, these
"don't tells!"
What misery
they make in the 0 '
world-from the "DoN'T TELL."
(mall tot whose dearest chum "goes
rack on her" to the grown woman
ehose trust is betrayed and whose life
a ruined by one careless word! Isn't it
Ltter never to say anything about our
'riends that we wouldn't repeat to their
aces? Isn't it better not to have that
ort of secret at all?
