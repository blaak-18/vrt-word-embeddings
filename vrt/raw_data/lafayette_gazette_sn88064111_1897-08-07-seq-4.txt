:iever created half the stir no diew half the crowds that our latest l6t f
NEW G DS. HAVE ATTRACTED.
Everything for Summer Wear for Ladies, Men and Boys carl be found in our immense stock. All prices, all colors, all sizes. Everybody wonders how we ntluage :t
be crowded every day, when June is considered a dull month. So y it is the electric fans which render our big store so comfortable that we are alwa crowded.
Otheers sa y it is our polite, accommodating clerks. Still others sa - hoo-joo the public. All are partially correct, and here is the rest of the secret: E CHARM
-THEM WITH VARIETY, WE MESMERIZE THEM WITH STYE, WE HYPOTIZE THEM WITH QUALITY."
And while they are in this helpless condition, we knock them clear off the Christmas Tree with prices. It sounds cruel, but they all like it and come again and again,
bringing with them other victims to be made happy by Mistrot Brothers and Company's remarkable, new methods of hoo-dooing. We will tell you of a few of :the many
good things we are offering. "Just a few mind you, but there are others:"
