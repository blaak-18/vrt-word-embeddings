Czarism In Louisiana.,
If we believe what the. Demo
cratic palpers of Louisiana say, the
only didterenco between this State
rgovernment and the government
of Russia consists in the fact that
[ the people of this State go through
the farce of voting every four
years for a change of administra
ation that it is impossible to change
against its will, and in Russia there
is no l»iasibility for a change and
no farce of election held, If there
E is no constitutional law, or statu
º tory law by which the returns can
he examined into by authoritory
higher than the supervisors of
election in each parish, then it is a
e settled fact that "once in power
means always in power" in Lou
isiana.
The present Governor appoints
one of the Supervisors, the Clerk
one, and the Police Jury one, each.
* These three appoint all commis
Ssiotlers and have all power to issue
instructions and compile or change
the returns, as way done in this
lparish on April 28th. Two of
these supervisors-a majority--are
of Fosters household, at least they
are creatures of appointees of his,
Pand of him. If he can not bel
- elected with all the machinery in
his own hands, he certainly must
- be repugnant to the:people, and if
r once returned as elected the peo
pbh have me way of purging the
ballot box of frauds, his meat in
1 the gubernatorial chair is as safe
as that of the Car of Russia.
' But will the people step short of a
thorough investigation when every
thing points tothe fact that he was
not elected, but only "returned
I elected" without the formality of
*leven eastit the votes as was evi
Sdently done in many parishes in
. this State. We believe not. We be
, lieve the ease will go to the highest
r .tiboul in the law before he will
be permitted to steel a State. We
know our people are patriotic and
b there is a tidal wave of disgust
- rolling over the country that will
r engulf every onem who attempts to
i stand up for such methods longer.
We do etC believe ous people will
upbold the usurper, no mat
r terif tie does war ths cme bop- 4
r ored mea ao Demoorat, and pose
as the apostle of white supremaey.

no te-rrors for t!it-ic white iln I
- who are as earnestly and as equal
SIy deteriiirned that the miserablle
Shand of adventurers, masquerad
SI mng as the I)emocratic party, shall
I not accomplish this purpose.
These men have, dnrinn the
t course of the most remarkable po
litical calnvass in the State, assunii
ed to represent all the virtues and
f all the morals of the people, and
the princiles and aims of a great
political lparty.
At first, they undertook the role
c of debt extinguishers, from which
r they were driven in clerison.
r Next they appealed for counte
nance and support on the plea that
the great party of Jefferson anti
Jackson had in them its exponents
and preservers.
This claim 29,600 Democrats,
who voted for Capt. Pharr, ac
cording to the Timeos-Democrat,
repudiated with scorn.
As a last resort those shameless
upstarts, representing naught but
the lowest of political morals-if
it can be called morals---assunled
to champion the cause of white su
premacy and 'proclaimed them
selves the "saviors of Caucasian
civilization from African domina
tion,"
Sixty-four thousand and six
t hundred white men, accepting the
esitnmte of their own organs, the
"great morning daily" already ci
I ted and the Laka Charles Com
mercial, a country paper of pow
I er, character and influence, scorn
fully repudiated at the polls on
election day this boasted assump
tion and votet for the Republican
Populist candidate, Captain Pharr,
diving him a majority of more
than twenty thousand white votes
in the State.
Outlawed by public opinion and
disgraced before all good men,
these despicable follows have seiz
ed, under color of law, the State
Capitol building at Baton Rouge;
have stored therein arms and am- I
munition wherewith to defend a
fallen cause.
The opposition to the measures i
and purposes of Fosterism has
been, so far, clearly within the
very letter of the law. The men
composing it have met and answer- I
ed the arguments of their oppo- I
nents; guarded the polls and are I
prepared to prove, with irrefuta- t
ble and overwhelming testimony,
that Foster and his co-conspirators
deliberately stole his pretended
election; stuffed ballot boxes with t
teas of thousands of nero votes, I
falsified returns and used, as is I
well known, the power of the mili
tary arm of the commonwealth in
an attempt to change the result of I
the legislative contest.
Thousands of the citizens of this I
eity have met and declared that t
their votes, as wiell as those of 1
their fellow citisens of Louisiana a
sIlll be honestly eouned.
The Legisilture elected have doe- a
clared that they will see to it that c
no attempt tosteal the State shall I

We desire, in behalf of the
Democratic party and the Demo
cratic white masses of Louisiana,
to warn these misguided men in
the most solemn and emphatic man
ner that the l)emocratic State of
ficers and a Democratic State leg
islature have been elected and are
going to be installed, and woe be
tide him who lifts his hand to pre
vent them.
That little cohort of Democratic
politicians seem to forget the fact
that the white men that voted for
John N. Pharr "know their rights
and dare maintain them." The
"old Swamper," like the old e- :
man, will go to Baton Rouge and r
carry peace and war. Peace if
by an honest count it is shown
that Foster has been eleeted Gov
raor ; war if a few political bull-I
dosers will try to over-ride the
will of the white people of the
State of Louisiana by placing an
usurper in power. Democrats,
