Sorrow's Only Joy. ti
lMy story relates to Bob Fortescue. "
It is shliot, linut touchintg.
When I first knew Bob lie was in
the war ,ifli4ce.
A very good-natured fellow lie was tl
in those dtlys, too. I
lie was to have been manlied to
one of the best and truest-helarted
girls ever born. He had a decent in
come. iHer parents were quite
agreealnle, and nothing seeCmed to
mar their hanlppinss.
I recollect her ,myselfas it were only ti
yesterday-a bright, faicinating little
darling, with duisky brown hair, lind g
an11d1 soft, liquid e,"es, so brlighit and
sparklilng you conuld never guess the 8'
color. One lmomenllt vol would vow "
the were brown. The next, le pre
pared to make soleminn nasseveration "
they were gra1y. So petite and child
like she was, so pretty, andl so fond f'
of liuoir lio. lle, in Ii s turni, coni
pletely idolizcud her, so that it seem
ed, fomr oncle, true love would colndes
conei to run ki 4llv in hi'eiics. t
Au uncle ot Mohll's died and left him "
a thou~id at year. The Wari Otliee '
clerki's liaie'1 W.as fixedil to take Il
p:lace six lmonths afterwarllds.q
Yet it was not to he,
1llu ni e Shirt molnth before the wed
ding day, pretty., right-eyed ilorie n
was taken nillddenly ill, landl lhob was
robbedl of his hiealt' hIlst treasurcby
that dreadi foe COlnsumptiolln.
She died in Bob's arl, with her
hand in his, an1d her bonnie head on i
his shoulder. s
Poor Boil! I shall never forget his
grief ; it was souetlhing terrible at S
the time.
He made a rigid vow that lie would t
never inlrry, and lie has kept it faith- r
fully. t
And now, althoung lie is only 30, t
his hair is tinged with gray, and
the lines in his face would make you
fancy lie was nearer 50. I
People who donl't know his sad a
story wonder why that quiet, grave.
looking Ilortescne hlat never married, 1
and thoughtless liarly Lawless says,
"D)rnt it yon know, Blen (that's me), t
your friend Fortescue is a capital fel. t
low, but lie's a trifle too gloomy for t
me, l1e'dl make an excelellnt hermit, I
with those strange ileas of his on
celibacy: Why don't lie start a cave
on his own account I I don't believe
lie's ever jolly, ot plays at billiards,
or any thing like thlit, you know."
But Harry is not a bad fellow. He's
only a happy-go-hluky individual,
who is always getting into trouble,
and coming out of it right side upper
most. He like the rest of the world,
puts down Bob Fortescue as a gloomy
melancholy misanthrope.
But Bob is nothing of the kind. He
only cherishes tie mnemory of the
past and his poor lost love too 1'ondly
to allow himself to again mix. in the
gayety of stchthy.
Whose hair is that chain made of
that hle Wears t-and whose portrait
does that massive gold locket contain
I attalhod to it f
And let os take one peep at his little
diawing-room.
To Whomili, think ynn, did that piano
belong, and whose the pile of music i
I mention the mnsic because it is
Soprano music, and Bob's voice is
still a good, rich baritone.
Can you iot guess I Ah ! you can
I know you can !
The hair, the portrait, the piano,
and the music, were his dear little
dark eyed Florries; and Bob values
these treasures more than ever abbot
vanlued the most sacred relies olf a de
parted saint, or miser loved his pre
ciolls hoarded gold.
So, you see, Bob has still these son
renirs of the past left to conllsole hlis
wounded heart; and, after all, lie en
joys life in his quiet way quite as
well as any other individual who hIas
Snever known sorrow.
Perhaps 30on may shake your head,
and say that hlie cannot find much
I pleasure in the memories of the past,
e and must be continually lamenting
the happy days lie spent before his
-great sorrow overtook him.
Take as an ezamnple, Bob Fortescne.
Yet, every Sunday does lie visit a
tastefili grave in a quiet little church
yard, not a huudred miles from Lou.
don.
r A pretty little resting-place it is,
overgrown with flowers, that are
evidently tended with :ehalou care
with a lheat little cross at the fool. I
and a little tombstone at the head, on
which rests the last iinaitortelle Bob
placed there.
Every Sunlday does Bob visit that 1:
retired spot, and always Idoes he s
leave a bouquet of fresh-cut flwers ; tl
for Florrie loed loved fowers, and tloweits a

And if becaes there is no bright a

gay and thollghtless world abiounll ? b
I an certain lie does ; andl if you h
wish to know why, I will tell you. i
One evening I called on Bob nn- 1i
expectedly. His servant told me I li
shonld find himt in the drawing-roon. I
As I never stalnd on ceremlUony with, I
hitm, I Inade my way to that apart- tI
lent, and wasalout to enter la nnU l
nounced, wheun I stopped suddenly c
on the threshold. tl
Bob was sitting at the piano wheln
I reached the door of the room, which 41
was standing open, but he never
noticed me. He sat there alone, e
dreamilv gazing at vacancy, appar- d
antly absorbed in his own secret s
thoughts. I wondered whether they I
were sad or happy. I did lnot enter C
the room, but paused unconsciously, o
I knew not why. u
Presently his hand wandered over sI
the ivory keys; softly they echoed to I
his masterly touch. I knew those tl
chords; I had heard them nany a ti
time and oft a few years before. ri
'Twas the song she used to sing; ;
and as Bob sat there, seemingly n
dreaming of the past, a soft ray of II
the sitting sun stole gently through si
the conservatory window, setting on "
his dreamy face lighting it up witlt a to
golden halo. As it did so, Bob smiled. tl
I vow to you that if ever an angelic it
smile lit up the face of mortal man, so n
was Bob's lit up then. j
Perhaps, I thought as his hand ti
wantdered over the keys, hle was list- 'E
ening for her voice in the spirt land d
far away-ay, and may be he heard
it, too !
Who knows I
lie may lare dlone so ; I cannot
tell; but Ican say this muich-I did
not take one step further into that
riomr. I instinctively felt I had no
right to be there ; so, gently and ii
quietly turning, I stole softly on tip.
toe down the stairs, took miy hat, and '
said to the servant, "Do not tell your I.
li;aster I have heen here this evening.
I will call again to.morrow." t
The man looked surlprised, but res
pectfully nodded assent. t
So I left the house, feeling that I
had no right to intrude on Bob at
ellth a moment.
Alh, Bob-dear old Bob-I know a
you are happy, and that, were this
whole world's riches laid at your feet,
they could not purchase for you such c
real pure happiness as yon feel during
those sacred mniintes, when your gen
tie soul wanders into spirit land
And that, gentle reader, is my story.
A very little story, is it not ?-and
perhaps youl will think little of it
now you haove read it.
It's only an old reminiscence raked
ip from tile melnory of the past.
There is a dear old ballad of lBalfe's,

that God never gave man a greater
Sproof of his love than to place womnan

Spropose to the most sensible girl you
know. If she says yes, tell her how
Smuch ytur inconle is, from what source
t derioved, and tell her you will divite
Sthe last shlilling with her, and love her
with all your heart in the bargain.
SAnd then keep your promise. My
word for it, she will live within your
Sincome, and to your last hour you
Swill regret that you didn't marry
sooner. Gentlemen, doll't worry
about female extravagance and femi
nine nutruth. Just you be true to
her, love her sincerely, and don't be
chary in telling her so, and a more
fonld, faithful foolish slave you will
niever meet inywhlere. You won't

Snever know it. Now throw aside
