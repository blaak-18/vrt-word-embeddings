OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
A NEW GEORGIA COUSIN.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you admit
a little Screven county girl to join
the childrens’ page? My papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and he likes to
read very much. He thinks that Mr.
Watson is the smartest man in the
world. I will describe myself: 1 have
black hair, brown eyes and dark com
plexion. 1 go to school and like it
very much. lam in the sixth grade,
and my teacher’s name is Cousin
Viola Burke. I like her very much.
I will ask some riddles; (1) Who
was a wile, the first day of her life,
and died before she was born? (2)
Twelve pears hanging high, eleven
men came riding by, each took a
pear, and left eleven hanging there
Now I will answer some: 1 think the
answer to Mildred Jeffrey’s is a
shadow, and the answer to Lee
Ware’s is an egg. If I have answered
these right, I hope to receive a card.
If this escapes the waste basket, I
will come again. With best wishes
to Daddy Jim and the little readers,
your little new friend, Mattie Burke,
Rocky Ford, Ga.
TENNESSEE ANSWERS.
Dear Daddy Jim:—lt has been a
good while since I last wrote to The
Jeffersonian, so I will write another
letter and see if it escapes the waste
basket. I received several post
cards, and answered all of them ex
cept two. I would have answered
them, but their names were not writ
ten plainly enough. If they will
write to The Jeffersonian, I will an
swer their cards. Papa is an agent
for Mr. Watson, and has one of
his books, and he thinks it is just
grand. I have read it, and like it
very much. Mamma is reading The
Jeffersonian now. She certainly
thinks Mr. Watson is a great man.
I think Daddy Jim is Mr. Watson. I
will answer some riddles: Eula
Roberts’ last one is “Thomas Tee Ta
tamus tied two tubs to two tall trees.
How many T’s in that?” There are
just two. Annie Cheely, I suppose
an ant’s tongue is smaller than his
mouth, if he has a tongue. Is that
correct? I believe lam entitled to a
card if that is right. Lee Ware, the
answer to your riddle is an egg. La
vada Stafford, a Dutchman builds his
pig-pen on the hillside to keep his
pigs in. Good luck to The Jefferson
ian.—l am, Georgia Wood, Heloise,
Tenn.
MORE RIDDLES.
Dear Daddy Jim: —As my first let
ter escaped the waste basket I
thought I would write again. I will
answer Lee Ware’s riddle: It is an
egg. Now I will ask some: Three of
us in six, and five of us in seven,
four of us in nine and six in eleven.
(2) What is it that has two heads,
one tail, four legs on one side, and
two on the other?—Your friend,
Edna Amus, Barrington, Ga.
WE ARE SEVEN.
Hello! Daddy Jim: —Here I come,
a little Georgia girl, for the first
time to join the Post-Card Club. I
have light hair, blue eyes, and fair
complexion. I am going to school,
and in the fifth grade. Mrs. Green
is my teacher. I have three sisters
and three brothers. My papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and he likes it very
much. —Your new friend, Willie
Hartley, Hoschton, Ga.
(It’s queer, how many girls have
boys’ names. Since this Post-Card
Club has been running, I can remem
ber Joe, Jack, Harry, Tom, Willie
and Andy. I don’t recollect a single
case of a boy having a girl’s name.
Do you know one?)
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD CHAMPION.
Daddy Jim and Cousins:—Here I
come, a wide-awake little boy, seven
years old. Mr. Watson, tell Mr. Ellis
I will meet him in joint debate in
your stead. Our school closed yes-
terday. We had a good teacher, and
her name was Miss Pearl Murry. I
will ask a riddle: What is older than
its mother? Who can read the fol
lowing letters corretcly: YY UR, YY
ÜB, I C UR YY for me. —Henry Law
horn, Buena Vista, Ga., Rt. 3.
SOME ANSWERS.
-Dear Daddy Jim:—Will you admit
a little Georgia girl in your Post-
Card Club? lam eleven years old,
and go to school. lam in the sixth
grade. I am almost four feet tall,
and have a fair complexion, light
hair and blue eyes. We take The
Jeffersonian, and I like it fine. I will
answer some riddles: The answer to
Mildred Jeffrey’s riddle is a shadow.
Lee Ware’s is an egg. Lavada Staf
ford’s is a man with one eye, and he
picked one apple and left. Her other
one was: To put his pigs in. I will
ask one: When is wine like a pig’s
tooth? I will close, looking for
those post-cards. With many happy
wishes to The Jeffersonian, I am,
Lillian Dyke, Jackson, Ga., R. F. D.
No. 8, Box 59.
FROM SOUTH GEORGIA.
Dear Daddy Jim:—Here comes a
South Georgia boy to join your Post-
Card Club. Papa takes The Jeffer
sonian, and likes it very much. He
is like Mr. Watson about missions;
he thinks more attention should be
given to home missions. I think Mr.
Watson is a very sensible man, and
like to read after him very much.
Well, for fear of the waste basket, I
will close, hoping to see this in
print. Will try to do better next
time. —Walter Hall, Pavo, Ga.
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you ad
mit a litle Georgia girl into your
Club? Grandpa takes your Jeffer
sonian and Magazine, too. He thinks
Mr. Watson is the greatest man the
South has ever produced since the
days of Toombs and Stephens. I
think it is nice of him to give us
young people a page in his valuable
paper. I think the answers to Jero
mine Elliott’s riddles are these: (1)
Adam, because he was the first in
the race. And the second is to keep
their coats buttoned. Delia Coggin’s
is a watermelon. I will ask a few:
(1) Two brothers we are; the same
burdens we bear; the colder the
weather, the hotter we are. (2)
Why is a cat’s tail like a rope? I
will close now, and if I see my letter
in print will come again.—Mappey
Hilley.
A BIBLE QUESTION.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Here I come
for the first time. I have fair com
plexion, light hair and blue eyes.
I am eleven years old. Papa takes
The Jeffersonian, and likes to read
it very much. I will ask a Bible
question: How many Books of the
Bible did Moses write? What is it
about a wagon that is not of use to
it. With best wishes to Mr. Watson
and the Jeffersonians, your friend,
Keller, Eva, Ala, Rt. 1.
A WATSON BOY.
Dear Daddy Jim: —As I have seen
so many letters from the little folks
I thought I would write one too. I
am a little boy, twelve years old. I
am going to school now, and am in
the sixth grade. My teacher’s name
is Miss Sarah Thompson. Papa
takes the Magazine and Jefferonlan,
and enjoys them very much. I will
answer some riddles: The answer to
Ola Hairston’s is a river, J. D. Mang
ham’s is a cotton blossom, Theo.
Jones’ is a churn. I will close for
this time, hoping to see this in print.
—Your little namesake, Millard
Watson Barron, Milner, Ga., Rt. 2.
ANOTHER NEW FRIEND.
Dear Daddy Jim: —Will you ad
mit a little girl of thirteen in your
happy band of boys and girls? Papa
