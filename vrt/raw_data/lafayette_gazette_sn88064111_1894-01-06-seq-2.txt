GOOD ADVICE.
In looking over the files of 1889 *
of the St. Martin Reveille we came
across the following article written
by an intelligent and highly esteemed ,
young lady, who wqs the victim of
the -most dastardly saurderever com
mitted. in the State. The writer,
"A Looker-on in Vienna," is the un
obrtunate Miss Belle Robertson, who, I
6n a certain night, was strangled to
death by a black brute, near the
bed of her mother, whose throat
was cut. For this crime, the negro 1
Louiis Michel was hung, and Boyd
Chambers is serving a life-sentence
in the penitentiary. The good sense
and Christian sentiments contained
"in the article and the high consider
ation we entertain for the memory
of the deceased, have prompted us
to reproduce it:
-A tiny stone cast into the calm, still waters
f_ some tranquil lake will cause the ripples
to 'atend' fir and wide, and the unmstul
commotion thrills with ansiety the inhabi
tants thereof.
Just so the mighty stone of Progress roll
ing.ito ouran-dstcreates a mighty rippling
indeed, aglOhe waves beat against the sane
teary itself, causing many hearts to throb as
though we were threatened with inundation,
bringing ruin and destruction instead of new
hopes, and a wider .pargin for the Faith,
older than the everlasting hills themserves-
' faith that teaches that one of the two
great laws is this "Love thy brother-as thy
self." " "The greatest good to the
greatest number,". and by add
ing to our numbers we add to our influence
for good; by educating the many we bring
our brothers more readily to the understand
ing of the Right, and by enlarging their
views we make them more nearly the chil
dren of that father whose love watches over
both, Jew and Gentile,. and with Whom
there is no varying. -'Enlarge ye your
borders" is a command from on high; we
re taught by the parable of the good Sama
ritan who it was that loved his neighbor
best.
Surely in this fair region, "Heaven's
-order-land," we who love it have named it,
their should be space for everything but dis
sension. The motto of our country teaches
as thut strenght exists only in union. Why
not then put aside all ideas of meum and
Â·4m; let us all work together for the com
Smon weal, not supposing that only one way
eap we attain our wishes-that there is but
en way and that it is possible for all to view
s~lrs in the same light.
If we are told that more shade was re
qaired to make our town more attractive to
sngers, to increase our population, and our
power for good in the land, it would be our
Imperative duty to plant trees, to cultivate
hruibs, to invent new ways of providing
aginst overpowering and objectionable
*het. And if we are told that we require
'.amore light, mentald or otherwise, is it not our
S , stll thriving for wider inflsence, to
Sthe efforts of those- who may bring not

visaged .stoyerr, death. The best

sav~her from the inevitable. The

she was forced to yield, and "

powerful dower. This noble lady
was one of the many who never re

her deeds of charity on earth will
ever remain dear to the many, whose
cares and troubles where soothed by
her always willing hand. Her un
timely demise will be felt by her un
consolable husband, affectionate

vacant chair near the hearth alone
remains to remind them of its once

Her funeral was conducted accord
