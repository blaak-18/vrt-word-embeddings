the famous Red
hill, a doubly significant title by rea

Red hill the road again enters the
South park. passes through the old
town of Fairplay, once boisterous with
the gayety of pioneer gold diggers, and
now given over to Chinamen, thence to
Buckskin Joe and over the Mlosquito
pass.
Red hill was the danger point on the 1
Sof first division of the road. Near the
Ipe- summit is a little basin where the road
ad, is completely hidden from view on all
sides. Little gulches lead up to this 1
spot from the South park, affording
every opportunity for road agents to
reach the place unseen and to likewise .1
make their escape. "Pilgrims"' for 8

money, and a great deal of wealth S
the originally intended for investment in 1
'51 the carbonate camp was turned over to t
1h gentlemanly persons who encountered t
hb! the stage in the little basin on Red hill.
The individual who sat on the dusty h
old Concord coach and pulled the rib- n
bons over six bronchos between WVeb- 0
ster and Fairplay was known as Jim.
I made his acquaintance while we were d
at dinner in the rough board "eating
house" at Webster. Ilie was a tall, i'
L slim, muscular man with a swarthy
complexion, dark eyes, and a heavy
mustache black as jet from the copious
use of dye. He wore high-topped
boots with extremely high heels, and
r his feet were small and delicately
,r shaped. lia trousers were of gorgeous
io plaid material, the bottoms being worn
inside his boot-tops. A wide-brimmed,
white slouch hat was cocked rakishly
on the side of his head. Some garish
jewelry adorned the front of his waist
coat. There was a jaunty" air about
* him which was less pronounced by rea
son of the stiff and awkward way he
carried his arms; I attributed this to
L. the natural effect of driving six spirited
horses for years over a mountain road.
He had formerly been a gentleman
D of fortune, and at one time in his ca
reer had amassed a considerable sum of
money in the game of chance known
as draw poker. When he was at the
height of his prosperity another gen
tleman of fortune, late of Texas, drifted sil
usnostentatiously into camp and caused pi
the report to be circulated that he was ot
C aching for a game. Jim undertook to fr(
relieve the gentleman of the pain ha
he was suffering on that account, ph
and they met in the back room of
Uncle Billy Coleman's Palace of Fash- ag
ion on Main street. the
There was a silent controversy in all
the early part of the game caused by the
a remark of Jim's to the effect. that the
"people from Texas seemed to have
more luck than a Chinaman." to
The gentleman from Texas demurred cia
to this and said there was no such
I thing as luck in draw poker; the go
chance features of the game, he said, a

he was wearing; everything else he in F
had oned in the world had passed the
into the hands of the skillful and forban
scientific gentleman from Texas. fron
The Fairplay gambler arose from the the
table and relieved himself of some cu
choice profanity, ost of hich was hold
directed against himself. He declared beer
that he as "better qualified to drive a en
stage than to pose as a gentleman ofsser- mar
fortune." The superintendent of the his

elve he became. It was a monotonous life
for until the road agents began to pay fre

nera Heterophemy, the curious disease
that which consists in using one word when
0om- meaning to use an entirely different
was one, gives rise to many anmusing com
over binations. An old lady living in a
life town on the Hudson river is thus af
fre- flicted. She is tall and stately in ap

mid Strange to say, she herself is totally

endeavor to save her from the martifi
ead- cation she would feel.
Ped Not long ago, when she was recover
mn- ing from a serious illness, the bishop of
>Wn the diocese chanced to be making his
c, I annual visitation, and at the sugges
Sto tion of the rector, they went together
hat to call upon Mrs. Drew.
hts She was delighted to see them, and
he entertained them with her usual grace
as and cordiality. The conversation nat
.ay- urally touched upon her illness, and
,gi her thankfulness at her recovery, which
n a for a time had. been despaired of.
en* Presently she turned to the bishop,
saying earnestly, "'My dear bishop, let

le's iously, "let's have a little drop."
nt- "Certainly, Mrs. Drew," interposed
by the rector, waiting for her to make
some move which might disclose her
on meaning. But Mrs. Drew waited ex
ad pectantly, also.
S "If you have not your Vade 3Mecum

VO said, after a moment.
The rector, with a sigh of relief,
ale turned to the bishop. "Mlrs. I)rew will

"Your visit has been a pleasure,"

Bielknap, won't you take this little boy
home to your dear wife, with my best a
of love?"
For a moment Mr. Bellenap wondered
if she could mean the bishop, but she
relieved his mind by lifting a magnifi
cent bunch of roses from a vase on the
table.
Allied to this is another form of mis
speech, to which most of us are occa
. sionally subject-the exchange of syl- a,
lables. A certain young lady. who,
to hlr intense mortification, often re
verses her vowels thus, says she is en
tirely unconscious of it, even after w
speaking.
One summer evening she was saun
tering with a friend toward the village b
post office of the little town where
they were staying. On the way they t
encountered an acquaintance with a
handful of letters.
"Ah, good evening," she said in her
peculiarly gracious, suave manner. ti
"Are you straling out for your mole?'
The mystified young woman made Ic
some inarticulate reply and passed on. Al

Le gravity she gasped: "I suppose you gr

ir strolling out for her mail?"
a The same young lady was relating a s
sad story of various misfortunes which

Health Rules for Women. p
There are three things that give a boy?
woman perfect form, movement and N
disposition. Resolved into rules, they have
are as follows: Don't fret, keep clean, kept
and, finally, keep supple. To keep sup- tendm
ple a woman must begin by breathing only
right; then she must walk with her "01
muscles instead of her bones, and, lass- you
ly, she must exercise regularly. The Press
best way to keep slean is to rub a nice,
soft cream into your skin before taking Fri
a bath, and then take that bath just as mee.
hot as possible. The cream feeds the Sul
skin and the hot water cleanses and porkt
softens it. The way to keep from fret- to m
ting is to put your thoughts upon some- stree
thing else than yourself, and, above all, my w
to have an interest or object in life. "\V
No woman need fear old ago if she has rty?

nto A smart jacket and hat, both for
ver summer and winter, are absolutely
in- necessary in every woman's outfit.
a Coats and jackets are beyond the skill
te. of dressmakers; they had better be
a bought in any of the shops where twice
nts a year there are also sales, at very much
as reduced prices, of extremely well !
cit-ut garments. For eight and ten dol
or lars jackets of very stylish cut can be '
t found, but these mnust he altered to fit.
're If.a woman has any taste at millinery
she can trim her own hats for far less li
to money than she can buy them ready- Â°
N. made, but it is a very good investment b
en to pay eight or ten dollars, spring and i
re fall, for one stunning hat, which must
r, be becoming; and in tllis connection it is u
Al- as well to remember that a hat which
tie is becoming to the full face is often r
ed terribly trying to the profile, and justr
as much care must le taken for the
ro- side as the front view. Picturesque
in effects are much to be avoided by the lc
i e woman who has only a small allow- F
ad ance for dress. It is the women who tÂ°
spend thousands a year who can best to
he afford to go in for big hats, outre gar- .
d mepts, indeed, anything' conspicuous. "i
le The fashions of picturesque hats and "
he clothes generally are very fleeting, and Fi
al nothing is nlore depressing than to put hi
all one's money into some article of 1i
raimnent so conspicuous that one is bt
known by it for the months one is
'- doomed to wear it.-IIarper's 1Bazar. E;

money; you'd know its value then.
