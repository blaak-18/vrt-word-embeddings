What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
PHOSPHATE ROCK AND MANURE.
A writer in Hoard’s Dairyman
gives his experience with a combina
tion of phosphate rock and dairy barn
manure. He obtained a carload of the
ground rock, and used it in the stable
gutters, a pint, or so a day to each
cow, and also sprinkled it about in
the same proportion in the manure
piles. This manure was hauled out
during the winter on land that was
planted to corn the following spring.
The result was pronounced next thing
to marvelous. Land similarly treated
was also sown in barley, with equally
gratifying results.
There is no question of the value
of that treatment. An addition of
lime to the phosphate would make it
still more ideal. Acidity is a great
hindrance to productivity in many of
our soils. Neutralizing that acidity
while adding ammonia or nitrogen
and humus from the manure, and
phosphorus from the rock, must lead
to results that could scarcely be
counted on.
SUCCESS.
Believe in yourself; sow burr clov
er and alfalfa, if possible; keep hogs,
dairy cows and chickens; patronize
the co-operative creamery—if there
is none, start one —; be cheerful and
hopeful; .economize on the little
things and do not be extravagant
with the big ones; make cotton sub
serve your interests rather than be
subservient to cotton; work hard and
play hard —these are the attributes of
the successful Southwestern farmer.

WATERING BEES.
a certain bee-keeper recommends
the following method of watering
bees: Take a keg or barrel and
make a hole near the bottom just
large enough for the water to trickle
out slowly on a sloping board where
it will spread out. The bees can then
drink their fill without danger of be
ing drowned or of being poisoned, as
would be the case if they had to go
to a running stream or nearby sprayed
orchards. —Southern Agriculturist.
“We have faith in Southern
farming,” says the Progressive
Farmer. “We realize that, in spite
of all our faulty methods and all our
imperfect systems, it is the agricul
ture of the South which has built up
its cities —as well as the cities of
other sections —and which has chang
ed this region from a land of seem
ingly hopeless ruin to one of com
parative prosperity and of untold
possibilities. If all this has been
done under the crude, wasteful and
often destructive methods of the past,
what may not be accomplished when,
with a clearer view of the underlying
principles of scientific farming, a
more careful attention to the details
of every-day work, and the general
adoption of more economical meth
ods, the Southern farmer starts out
in real earnest to make this country
what it should be? We believe that
good farming—the kind of farming
that our readers, and that all the
farmers of the South, are going to
do — W iii not only produce crops at
a lower cost and hence at a greater
profit, but will also redeem the worn
out fields of the South and convert
the lands now waste and unprofitable
•into fertile and productive areas, the
homes of a thrifty, progressive and
prosperous people.”

For asparagus rust spray regularly
with Bordeaux mixture. As soon as
the crop is cut use the sprayer.
Spray at intervals of a week or ten
days for four or five times. In two
seasons it can be eradicated.
The strawberry beds set out in
•early fall—the earlier, the better —
make the larger crop of berries.
Plants should have sufficient mois
ture. It is necessary, at times, to
use the garden hose in order to sup
ply them with the needed moisture.

his garden is doomed to disappoint-
Indian Summer
By Elizabeth W. F. JACKSON
When the harvest is gathered and safely stored,
And the squirrels have hidden their winter’s hoatd,
To keep gaunt hunger away;
When the fields are all stubble, and look where we may,
We see sleep coming on after Nature’s long day,
Then Indian Summer is here.
All the woods are then radiant in colors so rare, —
For even the frost helps to make the world fair;
And the hazy, smoky air
Makes the hills look far distant and blue like the sea.
But near, very near, seem the heavens so free,
When Indian Summer is here.
O’er the late blooming flowers bees drowsily hum.
And to me, as I walk in the warm, mellow sun,
Sweet scenes swiftly come.
Then fancy runs riot; and I look at life
With the eyes of a dreamer, sans care and sans strife;
While Indian Summer is here.
How blissful were life, if each day that should come
Were as peaceful as this, ’neath the soft Autumn sun,
Filled with visions so rare;
With our cares far away like the hilltops so blue;
And our joys close at hand like the heavens so true;
When Indian Summer is here.

More than 3,000 acres of Texas

Current Facts.
Many packers lost money last year
on cold storage eggs. The house
keepers want strictly fresh eggs.
Pullets are better layers than old
er hens; therefore, if your pullets
have not laid well this year do not
deceive yourself by expecting them
to do better next year—they will do
worse with the same sort of care and
feed. Dispose of all the pullets that
do not lay well.—Progressive Farmer.

A DRY FARMING LESSON.
In Erath County, Texas, three men
planted cotton in the same field.
When extremely dry weather came,
Mr. Geo. Lydia and Mr. Miller decid
ed not to work their cotton. Mr. T.
J. Lydia cultivated his without wait
ing for rain, and made a dust mulch
about it. Later, the first two lost
their crops. T. J. Lydia’s crop is
fine, and growing rapidly. Now the
question should be asked by every
man interested: What made the dif
ference? The soils were the same;
conditions were the same.
The dust mulch preserved mois
ture, and let in moisture from the
atmosphere. Cultivation permitted
air to reach the soils and roots of the
plants, without drying them out.
There are few stronger instances of
the advantage of cultivation in dry
weather.
Mr. Geo. Lydia and Mr. Miller have
learned by failure. Mr. T. J. Lydia,
by success; and tens of thousands
should learn from their experience.—

The asparagus beetle is a trouble
some pest and hard to fight. Clean
cutting, especially in ridge culture,
keeps them well under control in
spring, but considerable harm is done
later on by slugs or larvae. Poultry
are very fond of these beetles, and a
few fowls will soon capture the ma
tured insects if allowed in a garden
bed.
Grade the eggs before sending to
market —white and colored, and
large and small, in separate boxes.
Every farm should have a few
rods of hose to attach to the pump
in case of fire.
WHAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES
STAND FOR.
(1) The Republican Party:
Stands for the old Hamiltonian
idea of copying, as nearly as possi
ble, the English system. The key
to the mystery of Republican success
is the alliance between the White
House, Wall Street and the Pope.
The aged Italian priest who is the
present Papa of the 12,000,000 Cath
olics of the United States, publicly
assured his children last year that
he approved of Mr. Taft, and Papa’s
devoted flock went to Taft on elec
tion day.
As to the President’s cabinet, that
is notoriously a Wall Street selec
tion.
(2) The Democratic Party:
Is the “extra-horse” of the special
ly favored Interests. Whenever the
Republicans are not quite able to
“deliver the goods” (promised when
the corporations filled the dough
bag), the Democratic Party lends a
sufficiency of votes to turn the trick.
For proofs,—-see record of the ex
tra session which renewed the power
of Speaker Cannon, and made a tariff
a bill under trust dictation. Also
record on every important issue since
the Civil War.
(3) The Prohibition Party:
Its distinctive purpose is the pre
ventation of the manufacture, im
portation and sale of alcoholic bev
erages.
(4) The Socialist Party:
The American leaders of this move
ment preach one doctrine in cities
like Chicago and New York, and a
different doctrine when talking to
country people in Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Texas and Florida.
As I will prove in a series of chap
ters in Watson’s Magazine, Socialism
proposes to abolish entirely the pri
vate ownership of land and other
means of production. Arguing that
our one-wife marriage system was es
tablished to perpetuate capitalism,
these fanatics propose that people
shall marry without any sort of civil
or religions ceremony, and that a
husband and wife shall have the lib
erty to abandon one another, and
“take up” with a fresh wife or a
fresh husband, whenever either are
dissatisfied. This is Free Love, and
Socialism stands for it, as I will
prove by Socialist evidence.
(5) The People’s Party (Populist):
Stands for the public ownership of
all public utilities, —such as rail
roads, telegraphs, telephones, express
companies, municipal water, light
and street car systems. Populism
holds the marriage tie sacred, and
denies the right of the husband to
discard the wife when she has per
haps slaved away her physical at
tractiveness in his service. In other
words, we contend that our divorce
laws are quite liberal laws enough,
and that the 50,000 annual divorces
of this country prove that “love” is
as free as need be. To attempt the
selfish lusts of men holding out to
them the pernicious doctrine of Free
Love, endangers that beautiful prin
ciple of self-restraint which is the
conservator of law and order, good
morals and decent living.
