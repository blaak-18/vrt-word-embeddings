What Our Farmers Are Saying and Doing
WHY THE FARMERS SHOULD
ORGANIZE.
Speech Delivered by Leonidas F.
Scott, Editor of the Conyers Free
Press, to the Oak Grove Local
Farmers’ Union and their Visitors
Saturday Evening, July 3rd —
Whence, And Whitherto, Has
Flown This “Wonderful River of
Gold?”
The speaker was introduced by
Hon. W. F. McDaniel in a most pleas
ant manner, and before beginning
his remarks, Editor Scott read his
certificate of membership in the At
lanta Typographical Union No. 48,
that is framed and kept in his office,
and is one of his most valued and
highly prized possessions.
Having labored and toiled since I
was twelve years old, most natural
ly understand and feel every heart
throb and pulse beat of those who
toil for existence not only in the
field, under heavens broad canopy of
blue and vaulted skies, in full light,
and under the scorching rays of
noon-day suns, but in whatever
realm and walk of life men, women,
and children labor, the speaker un
derstands their every thought and
every step they take, and has ever
been a most ardent supporter of
every movement looking to better
the condition of those who toil and
create the wealth of the world, but
get in return so little of the fruits
of their labor. It is solely on ac
count and lack of intelligent organi
zation, first; secondly, lack of or
ganizing whatever money is earned,
be it much or a small amount, into
an account in a bank that will earn
interest, or make with your earnings
some safe investment.
If the actinic rays of the sun were
not concentrated and focused, no
heat or light from that great power
house and luminary would reach this
earth, and existence on this planet
would be impossible, and there would
be no animal or vegetable life, and
darkness and chaos would reign su
preme.
Go to the great cotton mill right
at our doors and what do you see and
with what are you the most impress
ed: “Organization” first, and system
next, and their persistent application
and obedience with intelligent and
well directed effort, each trained
worker from the humblest place in
the great organization to the office,
where is enthroned one man on
whose shoulders the whole organiza
tion rests, and whose eyes and brains
have to watch and know every de
tail from the bale of cotton to the
finished product, that when sold
brings back a flow of gold dollars to
be given to those who have toiled so
diligently at the command of ma
chinery, making hundreds and thou
sands of revolutions a minute.
Go to any great electric plant, and
you see at a glance that the great re
sults accomplished are alone possible
except through “organization,” and
the units of energy created by the
hand of Almighty God could not, and
did not, serve us until intelligent
skill “organized” those units of sub-
lime energy into a working force,
and then by simply pressing a but
ton —light! power! Press a button
by the hand of the President in
Washington, and the great machin
ery in the Alaska Yukon Exposition
become things of life—and the whole
world applauds and knows the show
is open—Organization! Power!
By organization you have a tele
phone in your home—and if you de
sired to test it—in twenty minutes
you could send a message to the re
motest part of the earth and receive
a reply! Possible only through and
by organization.
Weie it not for organization we
would still be paying 30 cents per
pound for steel made in Sweeden
and hammering out sweeps on an
vils at every cross roads in this conn-,
try; but by organizing great com
panies with ample capital, the earth
has been forced to surrender her
raw material, skill and energy have
combined, and instead of paying 3 0
cents for steel per pound, you get a
five-pound scrape for 25 cents. Or
ganization !
By and through organization, no
tice what has been accomplished with
“ pioduct of our Southern farms once
thrown away! We blush at the
statement. In the last ten years the
cotton seed of the South were worth
$300,000,000 at 10 cents per bushel,
and we have received, and I am
afraid thrown away, that immense
sum—$300,000,000! from this one
source. Intelligent organization gave
ns the money for the seed that in our
ignorance we once threw away!
At 10 cents per pound, the South
has received $6,000,000,000 in the
last 10 years for our cotton crop. A
sum so vast the human mind can not
grasp nor comprehend, and the state
ment causes us to ask the question,
what has become of these vast sums
of money—a river of gold that has
run from the very throne of our kind
Heavnly Father through the South
ern States year by year. The South
ern farmers have created by their
foil in the last ten years, and receiv
ed gold therefor, enough money to
almost buy the earth! The question
arises to the inquiring mind, what
has become of our “river of gold?”
Ihe answer is easy, “through ignor
cane and lack of intelligent organ
ized effort, we have actually given it
away! For, if you take away from
the tax returns the amount of land
values—and the earth was here
when we commenced to make this
great wealth—we have very little
left to show for the billions of dol
lars that have passed through our
hands—s6,3oo,ooo,ooo received in
the past ten years in the Southern
States from the production and sale
of cotton and cotton seed alone! And
the other millions received from the
sale of peaches, melons, vegetables,
and other products of Southern
farms!
What has gone with all the gold
received? Through lack of intelli
gent organization, most of these vast
sums have, been thrown away! And
why? We might as well confess —an
honest confession is not alone good
for the soul —but also for the mind,
Jeffersonian
body and pocket book. No error or
mistake has ever been corrected un
til those who have made it can be
awakened and made to see the errors
they have made. And ignorance is
the father, not only of all our trou
bles, but crime!
When the farmers become thor
oughly organized and awakened, and
better learn to cultivate, compress,
wrap, when, how and where to sell
this most wonderful of all the world’s
farm products, “that gets its snow
whiteness while we sleep from the
bright and twinkling stars,” then,
and not till then, will we get away
from the lowest scale of wages paid
for labor in American—s 0 to 75 cents
a day—and work in cotton fields will
not give over five months’ employ
ment in a year, and with improved
methods and improved implements
and machinery less and less manual
labor is required to make the crop
each year—and in adjusting the
scale of wages to suit negro labor—
we have forced our sons and white
labor to abandon farm life in the
South, and the mule and negro live
on the product of Western farms at
ruinously high prices for what they
consume—and away flows our river
of gold, yea; by year!
Hay can be produced here at six
dollars a ton, and corn at forty cents
a bushel. Think what we have paid
this year for these two items! River
of gold gone!
Fellow citizens, with bowed heads
let us confess our errors before Al
mighty God, who has dealt so gra
ciously and mercifully with us, and
forsake the paths we have so careless
ly walked in the past.
The Southern farmer is, and has
been, the most careless man in all
the world from a financial standpoint
—and has received such fabulous
sums of gold from his efforts, that he
has just failed to think, and all the
Southern farmers together have fail
ed to organize themselves into one
great unit of force as the banks, fac
tories, railroads and great corpora
tions are organized—from lack of or
ganization their great power of every
kind is wasted so far as they—the
Southern farmers—are concerned
and the product of their toil is gath
ered together by master minds that
are organized, and as a consequence,
a people who should be the richest
in all the world, are yet year by year
buying goods on credit, and borrow
ing the very gold that they have cre
ated and carelessly thrown away at a
high rate of interest.
But to come right home and get at
something practical: We can save
$300,000,000 to $400,000,000 in the
next ten years by just simply learn
ing to properly pack, compress and
wrap a bale of cotton. We pay $3.00
a bale, or $30,000,000 a year, just
because we do not properly pack each
bale of cotton and compress it at the
gin. We have in our ignorance real
ly thought we were being paid for the
wrapping on a bale of cotton! 30
pounds tare has always been, and
will Always be, taken off the price of
each bale just as long as we are led
and controlled by ignorance, and so
very careless with, and forgetful of
the great value of one of the most
important packages in all the world.
Now let Rockdale, and especially
Oak Grove Local, be among the first
to correct this great waste and loss
by installing a compress here at your
splendid gin, and more carefully than
ever clean the cotton and properly
prepare it for the gin that then can
more perfectly do its work; then
compress the beautiful mass of snow
white lint into a bale of proper and
uniform size, and wrap the compress
ed bale with cotton cloth that will be
worth more in any European country
than it costs here to produce, and
then the $3.00 per bale that we have
through ignorance been throwing
away will disappear forever, and the
South in every succeeding ten years
will be the richer by $300,000,000,
and we will feel proud of the fact,
and justly rewarded, by being one of
the first sections in Georgia to prop
erly pack a bale of cotton! No use
to try any other method. The great
organizations who own the com
presses will take off any other wrap
ping you may place on a bale of cot
ton as they did aforetime, and laugh
in your face at your ignorance. The
compresses, railroads and jute bag
ging trusts all understand each other
and you must fight organized intelli
gence with the same weapon.
Now, understanding your plain
duty, will you bravely and manfully
