eggs, and great quantities of butter
have been held from the Americans,
by a similar process. Almost with
out exception, the necessaries of life
are controlled by these trusts, and
when the new tariff laws gave them
greater powers from the home mar
ket, they simply made |ise of them.
Not only has this infernal Aldrich
bill increased the cost of living in
this country, but it has narrowed our
foreign markets. The exports have
fallen off $152,000,000 within the
last few months.
Commerce means an exchange of
commodities. If we deny to the out
side world the right to bring its
commodities to this market, we natu
rally lessen our chance to dis
pose of our goods in the markets
of the outside world. The higher the
tariff, the smaller is our foreign mar
ket. Foreign vessels don’t want to
come here, empty, to get carloads of
our goods; yet our tariffs are so high
that they can’t bring in a sufficiency
of foreign goods to enable us to get
our commodities into foreign mar
kets to the extent that we should.
How plain it must be to your mind
that if the tariff on cotton and wool
en goods were lowered one-half, our
people could buy the goods at half
the price they pay now, and would
therefore consume about twice as
much. They do not now buy what
they need, for the simple reason that
the price will not enable them to do
so. Were the duty on cotton goods
to go down, the amount purchased
would go up; and, of course, this
would create a demand for raw cot
ton, which demand would, as a mat
ter of course, increase, permanently,
the price of raw cotton.
The fact that the farmer is not get
ting too much for his cotton is proven
by the official reports that show he is
not accumulating any profits. The
fact that the Trusts are charging us
outrageous prices, is proven by the
fact that they sell their goods in the
foreign markets at very much less
than prices that we have to pay for
the same goods, and that they make
a profit of 35 per cent, on the goods
sold abroad. Therefore, it would not
be necessary for you to consult the
official reports to be convinced that
you are outrageously imposed upon
by the home prices; but if you will
consult the official reports contained
in the Statistical abstract, published
every year, by the Government, you
will discover that the Steel Trust
alone makes greater profits every
year than the millions of farmers
have ever cleared in any year. As to
the manufacturers, on the whole,
they not only clear 8 per cent, on
the money invested, but some years
their excess profits reaches the amaz
ing sum of two billion dollars. There
are only a few thousand capitalists
engaged in this protected industry,
but they pocket annually one-half of
the increase in wealth. It is simply
horrible, and will bring the country
to a bloody revolution, if peaceful
reform cannot apply the proper
remedies.

AS TO POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
Dear Mr. Watson:—Please ex
plain in weekly Jeffersonian the
“Postal Saving Bank”; I do not un
derstand it.
I am an earnest reader of your
weekly Jeff. Although I am not old
enough to vote, I watch our Con
gressmen just the same.
I am with you when it comes to
bank wreckers, but you hit Ward
too hard. lam a school teacher, but
I am going to do all that I can to
open people’s eyes to the importance
of the science of government.
Yours for good government,
W. B. READ.
Ras, Miss.
Answer.
In a general way, the Postal Sav
ings Bank means that the Govern
ment itself will establish a system .-of
Savings Banks which will enable
people to deposit their money with
the postmasters, and thus insure the
safety of the deposit. There are sev
eral different plans proposed and
there is a great difference of opinions
as to which is the best. But the sub
stance is that the postoffices shall
act as receivers of money saved up
for deposit, and that therefore each
one of these post offices will take to
itself, in some degree, the character
bf a Savings Bank. This would re
move one of the main troubles of the
present system. Postals Savings
Banks could not fail as long as the
Government itself was solvent;
whereas, when you put your money
in a bank now, you never can tell for
certain whether you ever will see it
again.
Possibly you would not think I hit
young Ward too hard, if you had
known how hard he hit me. He had
no provocation whatever to jump on
me in that way, for I hadn’t done a
thing to him. He misunderstood the
whole business, got his facts wrong,
and deserved a sharp call-down. He
has no interest in the paper he edits;
being a salaried man, paid by the
farmers of Mississippi, among whom
I have thousands of friends. These
were not only surprised, but offend
ed, when young Ward, without any
cause for it, jumped on me.
I am very glad indeed that you
are doing your best to co-operate
with me for the uplift of our fellow
countrymen. T. E. AV.

lost a great deal of information on
many lines.
By hearing my father (R. AV. Mas
sey) speak of you and reading some
copies of your papers which he takes,
I became interested and subscribed
to the weekly.
You have changed my mind on mis
sions. I was somewhat of an ex
tremist on Foreign Missions until I
read your editorials on this subject,
and now I will give my little dona
tions hereafter mainly to home mis
sions.
I pray God’s blessings and protec
tion over you while in this great re
form fight, and I believe you will
come out conqueror in the end.
Yours truly,
(Mrs.) J. A. WOOD.

THERE COULD BE NO HIGHER
TRIBUTE THAN THIS.
Dear Sir: —I see the time of my
papers has expired, and I can not
think of being without them, for they
come up to the standard of truth and
right between man and man, and
God and humanity. If we observe
the teachings of the two Jefferson
ians, they will surely do us good. On
the questions of Socialism and For
eign Missions, they are eye-openers.
Very truly yours,

MEETS HIS VIEWS TO A “T.”
Dear Sir: —I congratulate you up
on the great educational -work you
are doing in exposing the graft in
the business methods of the nation.
Your exposure of the Foreign Mis
sion methods meets my approbation
to a “T”. The commercial, so-called
religion must be given a back seat,
and the fanatics and so-called
preachers must be given the cold
shoulder.
We are compelled to return to the
old landmarks, socially, politically
:and religiously, or we will soon land
in the bottomless pit of oblivion. And
our only escape hinges upon educa
tion and the manhood to assert our
rights at the ballot-box. It is amaz
ing how the masses, with all their
experience in oppression and broken
pledges in partisan lines, can yet be
hoodwinked into tame submission.
With best and kindest regards, I
am
Yours truly,

AN APPRECIATIVE READER.
Aly Dear Mr. Watson: —Just to
show you I look for your paper. Re
ceived January 20th issue of weekly
this a. m. Got to reading it this p.
m., after return from office, and have
read every editorial in the issue ex-
cept “Just a Few More of John’s
Lies” and “Brother Len and Weary
Willie.” Am greatly interested in
Texas Co-Operator matter —having
read the letters from Texas farmers.
You missed one circumstance in
your “A Layman on Holiness,” —get-
ting stuck in the mud with ;a pair of
jackasses. That holiness idea is all
—well, I’d be afraid to print what I
told a holiness uncle of mine about it.
How true “Poor Mr. Ellis!” And
how noble that missionary work of
Captain and Airs. L. A. Odom.
And here’s “hopin’ ” it will be
Senator Vardaman!
While “a prophet is without honor
in his own country,” yet I feel that
you have more good, honest (sin
cere), and unselfish, “stick to the
finish,” friends in your own State
alone than Air. Bryan has in any six
States in the Union combined.
Would like to get some more arti
cles of the character of “A Tragedy
in a Tree Top” from your pen.
I like your political articles, but
also enjoy your excursions into the
human sympathies field.
Very truly yours,

“UNREASONABLE, A RROG ANT
CONDUCT” OF THE CLERGY.
Aly Dear Sir:—The fanatical
preachers, who have become so much
aroused by your noble, humane and
patriotic discussion of Foreign Mis
sion methods, are proving the truth
of the saying, “Whom the gods wish
to destroy they first make mad.”
I have seen it shown before, that
the most unreasonable and arrogant
conduct is to be found in the clergy.
They are intolerant and vindictive,
and, of course, reverse the example
of Him Whom they profess to serve.
The bigoted outburst of the
churchmen is giving you an excellent
chance to vindicate your right to
deal with Foreign Alissions as ably
and conscientiously as you do other
questions of national moment. It
will redound to your honor and to
the welfare of our people.

GLAD I’M GROWING.
Dear Sir: —Inclosed please find one
dollar, for which send me your Aliaga
zine for one year.
AVould to God we had a President
and a Congress of just such men as
our beloved T. E. Watson. The peo
ple would then have much better
times. You are growing in this
country.
