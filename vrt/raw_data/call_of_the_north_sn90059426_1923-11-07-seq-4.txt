SUPREME COUNCIL, SCOTTISH RITE,
REPUDIATES REPORTED ATTACK ON
KLAN AND JUDGE G. F. MOORE
Sinister Roman Conspiracy to Discredit Masonry, The Ku Klux Klan and Past
Sovereign Commander Foiled by Expose of Plot by Fellowship Forum*
Washington, D. C. —An insidious
Roman conspiracy with a triple ob
jective to discredit Freemasonry, the
Ku Klux Klan and Judge George
Fleming Moore, 33rd degree, Past
Sovereign Grand Commander of the
Supreme Council, Thirty-Third De
gree, Ancient and Accepted Scottish
Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, was foil
ed by the timely exposure of the plot
by The Fellowship Forum, a patri
otic weekly, devoted to the cause of
Freemasonry, 100 per cent American
ism and the advancement of Protest
antism through compulsory education
and the elimination of the parochial
schools, with their dangerous Cath
olic influences.
Catholic news services in Washing
ton spread a report all over the coun
try through the Romanized press, The
Associated Press and Universal Serv
ice to the effect that The Supreme
"Council at its annual session here last
week went on record as bitterly op
posed to the Klan and had caused the
resignation of Judge Moore from ac
tive membership in the Supreme
Council, because of the fight The Fel
lowship Forum, his publication, is
making to Americanize America and
rescue American Freemasonry from
the clutches of Romanist plotters,
who are said to have made inroads
into the order in California and New
York state.
Reports Are Repudiated
Shortly after the reports were cir
culated over the country by Catholic
correspondents at the Capital and the
two big news services, The Fellow
ship Forum instituted an investiga
tion. In reply to a letter from Judge
Moore, asking a denial or a confir
mation of the stories, John H. Cowles,
Grand Commander of the Supreme
Council, issued an official denial. In
a letter to Judge Moore, The Asso
ciated Press and Washington newspa
pers that published the fake reports,
Mr. Cowles emphatically stated that
the reports were in error and that
the Supreme Council had nothing to
do with the circulation of the report.
He stated that there had been no dis
cussion of Judge Moore’s connection
with the Klan and also stated that
the Klan had not been discussed in
any manner, “not even one remark.”
When confronted with this evi
dence, the Roman press of Washing
ton retracted their stories. The As
sociated Press also sent a denial all
over the country, quoting Mr. Cowles
to the effect that Judge Moore’s Klan
affiliations and the alleged denuncia
tion of the Klan was incorrect. Uni
versal Service also promised to re
tract its story.
SOME FACTS YOU SHOOLD (NOW (BOOT
THE (NIGHTS OF THE (D (LUX (L(H
Its membership is of the~highest standing, being composed of
Preachers, Lawyers, Bankers, Merchants, in fact MEN from every
walk in life.
THE KLAN never practices “mob law.” All reports of tar and
feathering committed by the KLAN are false.
KLANSMEN do not take the law into their own hands, but do aid
authorities in every way possible.
A KLANSMAN can not violate any moral or civil law, either
openly or otherwise.
The fact that its membership is SELECTED has no more signifi
cance than has the fact that other organizations, such as the Masons,
Elks, the Knights of Columbus* the Order of B’nai B’irth, the Nation
al Society for the Advancement of Colored People, and others tod
numerous to mention, select their membership from among certain
racial and 1 religious groups.
It is the only organization on earth that limits its membership
to native-born Americans. This can in no wise be construed to mean
that one of foreign birth cannot be as good and as desirable a citi
zen as any native-born American.
All 100 per cent Americans are not KLANSMEN but all
KLANSMEN are 100 per cent Americans, first, last and all the time.
Membership is acquired by invitation only. Invitation is made
ONLY after a thorough investigation and only to those who have
expressed a desire for membership in the hearing of a member.
It is not ANTI anything but stands for law and order and true
Americanism.
Because it does not admit men of the Roman Catholic or Jewish
faith to its membership, it therefore becomes a great 100 per cent
Protestant organization.

Text of Correction
The Christian Science Monitor,
published at Boston, Mass., dated
Wednesday, October 24, prints the
following repudiation of the story,
which was furnished that paper by
the Associated Press:
“Scottish Rite Head Denies Klan
Debate”
“Washington, Oct. 24 (AP). —John
H. Cowles, Grand Commander of the
Supreme Council of Scottish Rite
Masons for the Southern Jurisdiction,
today repudiated a statement dis
seminated by the council’s publicity
department, that at the recent meet
ing of thhe council here, the resig
nation of George F. Moore as In
spector-General in Alabama followed
a heated discussion on the floor over
the Ku Klux Klan.
“An investigation is being con
ducted, it was said, to determine how
the statement, which Mr. Cowles
brands as wholly untrue, came to be
given out.
“ ‘lp the interest of fairness,’ said
Grand Commander Cowles, *1 state
that there was no discussion what
ever over Brother Moore’s resigna
tion and there was no discussion at
any time about the Klan.’”
Investigation Madle
The Fellowship Forum’s investiga
tor managed to trace the vicious
story to its source through the “all
seeing eye and the all-hearing ear.”
It will expose the entire plot, as
soon as proper legal measures have
been taken to bring the guilty par
ties before the bar of justice in the
court of public opinion.
The Romanist slur on the Ku Klux
Klan made a victim of Judge Moore,
75 years of age, who has given 50
active years of his life to the cause
of Freemasonry, 35 years of which
he has been an active member of the
Supreme Council, thirty-third de
gree, as Incpector-General in Ala
bama, his native state. Judge Moore
is Past Sovereign Grand Commander
of the Supreme Council and has re
ceived every honor that Masonry has
to confer.
His fraternal weekly, The Fellow
ship Forum, exposed the laxity of
California Masons toward admitting
Roman Catholics to the order. It
also exposed the Roman inroads in
official posts of the Order of the East
ern Star in New York state. It was
through the editorial fight of Judge
Moore that these Romans were forced
to resign from their Eastern Star
posts and the order purged of Ro
manism. .
Exposure of the notorious Masonic-
Knights of Columbus “love feast” of
the Woonsocket (R. I.) brethren
brought about the cancellation of
plans for the joint “social meeting,”
when the Caseys got cold feet and
withdrew acceptance of the invita
tion extended them by Masonie poli
ticians of Woonsocket!
Martyr of Plotters
The Romanists recognizing the
danger of The Fellowship Forum’s
aggressive fight against the vicious
campaign Catholics are taking to un
dermine Masonry in this country and
their affiliated orders and realizing
the power The Fellowship Forum’s
fight for a national educational bill,
patterned from the Oregon Anti-
Parochial School Bill, is having on
the Protestants of this nation, were
quick to try to make a martyr of
Judge Moore.
High ranking Masons from all over
the country readily joined the stand
ard unfurled by Judge Moore for 100
per cent Americanism and a better
public school system, free from Ro
man" influences, Roman teachers,
principals and school board heads.
The reaction was so great that two
days after the plot was exposed J>y
Judge Moore, the veteran of many
battles, who has never yielded under
fire of guns or pen in the hands of
Papists, was so overcome with emo
tion and gratitude for his supporters
that he left his desks with a handful
of telegrams of praise from real
Masons and went home, where he
could give vent to his feelings in pri
vate.
Truth of “Resignation”
The truth of the “resignation” of
Judge Moore is:
After devoting 50 years of his life
to the active interests of Freema
sonry, 35 of which was an active
mmeber of the Supreme Council, and
seven years of wwhich he was Sov
ereign Grand Commander, Supreme
Council, Thirty-Third Degree, Ancient
and Accept Scottish Rite, Judge
Moore availed himself of the privi
leges granted active thirty-third de
gree Masons who have served the
Supreme Council ten years or more
and asked to be transferred to the
Emeriti List.
This action was brought about by
Judge Moore’s desire to give all of
his time to The Fellowship Forum in
behalf of fratemalism in general,
Freemasohry and Klanism in par
ticular.
H's request was granted and he is
now an Emeritus member. The
Grand Commander’s repudiated of
the misleading statements carried in
the Romanist press proves that Judge
Moore did not “resign after a heated
discussion over the Klan” and that
the Klan was not mentioned by the
Supreme Council.
Yawkey, W. Va. Excitement ran

sion. The rumor quickly spread that

“CATHOLICS WILL BE
BULWARK OF LIBERTY 0
“The time is coming when it will
be a recognized fact that the Cath
olic population of America will be
the bulwark of liberty, as we under
stand it,” declared Judge Thomas D.
O’Brien of St. Paul, in an address
Mbnay night 'at a reception and
meeting of the Duluth Council No.
447, Knights of Columbus, at the
club rooms, 224 W. First street.
Judge O’Brien asserted that, “We
are not a party to any faction, such
as Bolshevism and the Ku Klux Klan,
and we are not endeavoring to force
our views on any individual or group
of people.
“We do not have to prove our
Americanism by showing the other
man to be wrong,” he said.
Judge O’Brien asserted that, “We
are going through big changes in the
country today. The chaotic condi
tions existing in Europe will strike
this country unless we cling to re
ligious principles. Those of religious
principles will stand by the Consti
tution of the United States,” he as
serted.
The above sentiments were cred
ited to Judge O’Brien by the Duluth
News-Tribue of August 14, 1923.

KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS
DENOUNCE TREASON
ABLE SCHOOLBOOKS
(Special to the Fellowship Forum)
BRIDGETON, N. J. —Condemnation
of British and other foreign efforts to
belittle the part played by American
patriots in freeing this country from
the tyrannical yoke of Britain and ex
cuse the treason of Benedict Arnold,
through the spreading of sinister pro
paganda in public-school textbooks,
was made in a resolution passed at
the recent convention of the Knights
of Pythias, Grand Lodge of New Jer
sey.
Every Lodge in the state was com
manded by Grand Chancellor Elmer J.
Carll, of this city, to stamp out for
eign propaganda and condemn the
use of the objectionable textbooks.
A long list of textbooks coming un
der the official ban of the lodge was
included in the resolution. The text
books denounced as unfit for Ameri
can school children are:
“School History of the U. 5.,” by
Albert Bushnell Hart; “School His
tory of the U. S.” (1919), by John P.
O’Hara; “Burk’s Speeches on Conci
liation with America” (1919), by C.
H. Ward; “American History,” re
vised (1920), by J). S. Muzzey;
“Builders of Democracy,” by Edwin
Greenlaw; “Our United States,”
(1919), by William Backus Guitteau;
“McLaughlin & Van Tyne’s History of
the United States for Schools,” re
vised 1919; “History of the American
People,” for high school use (1918),
by Willis Mason West; “Short Amer
ican History by Grades,” and later
condensed into one volume; and
“American History for Grammar
Grades” (1920), by Everett Barnes.
“Resolved by the Grand Lodge,
Knights of Pythias of New Jersey, in
convention assembled, that
“We would be unworthy sons of
such fathers if we have not the spirit
and strength to retain in ink what
they wrote in blood.
“We would be unworthy of our
birthright and untrue to our princi
ples as a great American fraternity
did we not condemn theu se of his
tories and textbooks in our schools
that teach:
—Judge O’Brien.
“That Washington and his fellow
Colonists were proud that they were
Englishmen; that patriots were
drawn into the Continental army by
money, bounties and promises of land;
that the Boston tea party was a law
less destruction of property; that the
Revoluion was a contest between Ger
man tyranny and English freedom;
that the Declaration of Independence
was plagiarized from an Englishman
and our Constitution copied after
that of the Britains; that John Han
cock was a smuggler, Jefferson de
served a halter, and Patrick Henry
was a gay, unprosperous county law
yer; that Hamilton’s conception of the
people was ‘a great beast'; that the
great victory of John Paul Jones was
an accident; that Lawrence did not
say ‘Don’t give up the ship’; that be
littles the achievements of the pa
triots and teaches that Benedict
Arnold was treated unfairly; that be
cause they and the Tories censure the
patriots, belittle the accomplishments,
and impune the motives of those her
oes who by the sacrifice of their pre
cious blood won us our national free
dom, won us the use in our public
schools of such textbooks.”
After naming the objectionbale
textbook's the resolution concluded
with a pledge to support the Patriot
League for the Preservation of Amer
ican History in its plan to drive from
our schools all treasonable texts and
an order to Grand Chancellor Carll to
send copies to every lodge in the state
asking they join the fight.

the State Fair of Texas was believed
to be one of the largest which has
been recorded at the fair. The crowd
practically filled every available
space in the vicinity of the booths
and exhibits, packed the sidewalks
and was densest during the early
afternoon near £he - -loud speaker,
where orations were delivered by
visiting Klan officials.
The bulk of the croWd reached the
fair grounds during the early after
noon but the stream of people pass
ing through the gates was almost
continuous for hours and grew heav
ier toward nightfall.
Wednesday, the 12th day of the
fair, was Ku Klux Day and League
of Texas Municipalities Day.
Klansmen from Texas and Okla
homa and many other states attend
ed in large numbers. They came in
small groups, in large delegations on
special trains and in automobiles,
and people of Dallas swelled the at
tendance. A number of stores in
the city were closed during the after
noon and there was a general thin
ning out of the usual throng on the
streets. Many of the Klans brought
brass bands with them and music
was abundant. A large percentage
of the crowd which passed through
the gates wore Klan badges, although
a great many attended to observe the
Klan ceremonies and fill the part of
spectators of Klan activities.
Imperial Wizard Speaks
It was a jubilee occasion for the
Klansmen. Imperial Wizard H. W.
Evans and other high officials of the
organization attended. An address
was delivered during the afternoon
through the loud speaker by the Im
perial Wizard and was applauded by
a crowd of many thousand, which
congregated at and near the exhibi
tion hall.
Klan functions and gatherings
were in evidence everywhere
throughout the fair grounds and at
each the attendance was large. Late
in the afternoon a football game was
played at the stadium, a potato race
was held and a 50-yard dash for fat
men was staged by way of enter
tainment. At 9 o’clock P. M. a pub
lic initiation of Ku Klux Klan candi
dates took place in front of the
grandstand at the race track. The
initiation ceremonies were conducted
by Klansmen in full regalia. The
public initiation attracted thousands
and the attendance In the evening
greatly increased the total number of
visitors who passed through the gates
for the day.
