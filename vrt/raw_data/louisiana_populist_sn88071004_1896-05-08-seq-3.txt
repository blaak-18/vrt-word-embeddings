Repub!ican-Popullet Address.
New Orleans. May 5, 8596.
To the White People of the State
of Louisiana:
The Democratic State committee
held a meetine in the City of Now
Orleans on May 4 and issued an
address so remarkable, fale and
outrageous that it becomes our du
ty to reply to it at once.
The statement that the Populists
and the National Republicans have
ever advocated negro domination,
contributed to negro domination or
kreamed of negro domination, is
absolutely gratitons and false. The
Populists who nominated our tick
et at Alexandria were every one
of them white men. The National
Republican convention which in
dorsed the ticket were every one
of them white men. It was on
this nomination and indorsement
without any reference whatever
to any subsequent indorsement by
other political organizations that
this campaign was formed and
made. Every member of the D.nm
ocratic State committee knows this
statement to be the truth. There
was not a speech made during the
campaign by any of the candidates
or any of their canvassers, at any
of their meetings, which did not
declare the belief and the c mnvi, -
tion and the desire for the main
tenance of the white race in the
control of our government.
The strongest and much the larg
est support received by this ticket
ca ne from parishes where the
white people predominate, and
where they absolutely control and
dominate. The large negro par
ishes where the white people are
in a hopeless minority, with hard
ly a single exception, were return
ed against our ticket by enormous
majorit ies.
In the City of New Orleans the
Foster-Fizpatrick ring got down
on their bellies and begged for the
negro support.
Foster's triends in the pariah of
East Baton Rouge put two negroes
on their legislative tickets to catch
the negro votes.
Negro orators were employed to
speak from the same stands with
Democratic orators, and advocated
the same cause. It is a well-known
fact that Cage, Wilson, Kellogg
and Leonard, of the "negro comn
binatien," did everything they
could to aid in the election of the
ring ticket, State and city.
It is a fact that no man dare de
Iy. that every appeal and every
indseement in the way of moniey
and premies were held out to the
negroes throughout the Stste for
the purpose ao enticing them to
the support of the Foster ticket.
tgartag out in favor of the con
lSS amenimdment proposed by
ls tae, and placed upon

Ranglisieis to induee them to 1

the 1,aliot-blxucs were stuftted with
over 11(1t1 votes, and so on through
out the black belt ; when, we say,
N these tfcts are known to everybo
n dy in the State as having taken
d place, then for the State ring com
mittee to allege that the installa
tion of the Governor whom the
people have so overwhelmingly
e elected-Capt. J. N. Pharr-wouli
result iu "negro domination," is a
' charge so monstrous, so trans pa
rent and so weak that the wonder
s is that a;y decent man would dare
sign it, or be a party to it.
What have the people of the
fe air State of Louisiana come to,
LI that a body of men, olaiming to be
reputable citizens, should lend
themselves to declarations so false,
nlso infiamous and so calculated to
,t stir up trouble in the State, as this
r address embraces ?
We assert that the fusion ticket
has been elected, fairly and ove r
whelmingly, by the legal, honest
and public-spirited voters of the
State, and that the greatest fraud
and outrage ever perpetrated un
der a free government of the peo
Sple, by the people and for the peo
SIple, is being attempted by Gov.
t Foster and his partisan friends in
- the manutacturing ot majorities
- which were inever given him in the
e black parishes of the State, solely
that he might overthrow and tram
pie upon the will ot the majority of
t the white people of our State.
P We are all law-abiding citizens,
I having the peace, good order and
1 prosperity of the Coinmmonmwealth
- at heart, and we propose to employ
e only legal amnd honorable means to
vindiceate our cause. And we are
going to Baton Rouge for that pnr
pose, and we will not tolerate any
armed interference or armed dem
onstration by any one.
We demand, flrst, that the legis
lature shall examine and count the
honest votes of the late election,
and exclude those fraudulently re
i turned.
Secondly, that the returns of the
election shall be brought before the
Legisiature, andt when we say "the
returns," we mean the returns of
election contemplated by law, duly
sworn to by the commissioners of
a election, with the list of voters at
Seach poll, and with the tally sheets
from each poll, which is required ]
by law to be sent by the commnis
stoners ot election at each poll di
rect to the Secretary of State.
When thlse returns are brought
before the Legislature, ii;, upon an
honest examination, the Legisla.
ture finds them duly sworn to as
by law required, and further finds
that the said tally sheets and lists
of voters have been honestly andt
truthfully made out, we will sub
mit to the decisiont of the Legisla
ture.
But we insist emphatically that
the Legislature shall have "the re
turns" of the election required by
law upon which to act. We de
ma'd that the Legislature shall
have in its possession "the returns"
themselves; that they shall exam
ine them and see if they are fraud.
ulent; see if they agree with each
other; lt if they have not been
manufacttred; see If they are not,
In fact, wanting entirely.
We protest against the accept.
Sanue, as "the reumas," the "proces
verbal" from the supervisors ofeleo
'tlou, one of whomn is a direct ap
pointeeo ot Gov. Foster, aMl the
other us the appointee ot hise police
jury, which s also appointed by
+him.
These "proces verbal" are not re

Satonse or tabulationsa of "the re

sything else, and are in no sense

e cas and of the white Repulblicanus
c of this State, who have suppllllortedt
this ticket, is as pure and iininaciu
e late as that which conrses the veills
i of the proudest and most arrogalnt
ring Democrat in Louislana.
These men will stand by their
rights, and tight for them with as
t much courage and determination
as will any ring )Denocrat in the
State. They can neitlher bully, nor
browbeat, nor intimidate our peo
ple. We will have our rights.
I We ~ucpeal to constitutioual an
t thority, and invoke all the forms
of law, and will resort to force only
as a last extremity, to defend our
3 rights as free-born American citi
zens, when they shall be tlireaten
ed by torce and violence.
We call upon the white ment of
this State, who believe in right and
I justice anti fair dealillg, to asc(-ll
ble at i'arol Rouge on Monday,
I the lth, to protect their members
of the Legislature against the
threatened organized - violence of
Gov. Foster and his State ring
committee.
Capt. J. N. Pharr, the unldoubt
edly elected Governor of the State
of Louisiana-elected by an hlol
eat majority eo the legal voters of
the State, and supllorted by the
white public sentimel t throughout
the State-will be lpresent on that
occasion, prepared to assert and
maintain the rights of the People
adaiiust all usurlpers.

A Strango Mirage.
A Sky Picture of a Chic:tgo
Building Seen at Warsaw, Ind.
The strangest phenomenon ever
seen in Warsaw, Intld., was visible
recently during the big storm. It
was a mirage of the Masonic tem
ple in Chicago. The great build
ing hnný in the sky, apparently,
over a wagon factory near the
public square.
It was a strange day in more
ways that one. The wind was
high and rain fell furiously. Hail
as large as walnuts rattled on the
housetops and battered the win
dows of buildings. A great cloud
hung, after the storm had subsi
ded, in the western sky and on its
face was pictured the Masonic tem
pie in complete mirage.
The structure was plainly visi
ble, and people could be seen walk
ing about in its vicinity. Warsaw
is 109 miles from Chicago, on the
Pittsburg and Fort Wayne road.
It has a pohpulation of 3,50i.
