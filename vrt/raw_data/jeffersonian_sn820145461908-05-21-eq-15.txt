VOTE FOR
W. J. SPEER
For State Treasurer
His Record in This Office Is
Without a Flaw.
SH < i aH|
Under the law the Treasurer is solely re
sponsible for the deposits of State funds. The
act of 1893 (page 135, Acts of that year) in
plain terms limits such deposits to SIOO,OOO in
any bank.
This is a wise law, and while Treasurer, Mr.
Speer strictly observed it, that possible loss,
litigation and embarrassment to the State
might be avoided.
By careful personal examination of each de
pository, he always knew their actual condi
tion and kept the State’s balance with each
one well within the limit fixed by law. His
examinations of the other banks were equally
as satisfactory. No depositors ever lost a
dollar while he looked after their interests.
This is his record. Vote for hia.

I That Virginia-Carolina Fertilizers are far superior to any other fertilizers is Zsg g
proved by the experience of Mr. D. M. Griffin, D. D. S. of Plant City, Fla., /g&i
s who says: “I was trucking on a small scale, and decided I would try a few ay
sacks of your fertilizer, as it was cheap and said to be good. I put it un
der some tomatoes by the side of some other high grade fertilizer which j
cost me sls a ton more, and in the same proportion per acre. I don’t psi
| think I exaggerate in the least in saying that the yield where I used
| Virginia-Carolina Fertilizers was three times that of where I used la
|. the other brand of so-called High-grade fertilizer.” J/
