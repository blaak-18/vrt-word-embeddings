The "Noey Power" sadl the People.
(N 0. Democrat.)
A recenti special to 0one of our eCn
teusspumpnrea pHates that the New York
State Senate had aded dop a mnemnorial 4
making COnSgress to passa bill to eoun
pel deauilting t atues to pay their
debts. "Tihe oljetd of the credi
t!'rP," says the dlispatclh. "is to hring
their cases before the United 8taes'
Supreme Court, and, if juldgment is
ltained, let the armyv enforce colleh
tionai r
This repotteld menmorial is so ers
tirely ill accotrd with the spirit lwhiclh "
animates the "mloniey poeI)Cr" tlhat we
shall not bw surprised to find thatie it
was actually adlopted by the New
York Senste. For imore thimn ten
veats the finanIcial policy of the guyr
etnment lhas e1len conductedl in trhe
interest of the hand holders naod
national banks. Uninspired 1v :n
spark of either wisdom or pat: it,? ismu,
this cold blooded policy hahrn re-em i
morselessly pursmued until thime country
is literally banknrnpted and nmillions
of people reduced to poverty and vir.
teal serfdom. In 1873 wilver "wns
demonetized and tihe volume of lthe
currency greatly reduced. In 1875 1
the resunoption act was passed, and (
under that measure another great re- (
duction hss been made in the circu
lating redian. In consequence pro- (
perty of all descriptions has sank
from twenoty-five to thirty per cent
in value. Let the reader deduct
twenty-ive per cent frups the assesn
ed value of the property of the
Union in 1870, and he may form anl
idea of the enormous sum of which
the property holders have been robh
bed by the demonetisation of silver
and the process of contracting under
the resumption act. As money be
came seeareer, as the volume of the
currency was reduced by these
measures, like any other commodity,
like bread and meat, like shoes and
clothing, it became dearer and mnore
difliculit for the poorer people to ob
main. Finally it began to be a luuz
ry; the laboring people first, and
then the mechanics, could no more
obtain umoney than they could ob
tain broadcloth coats for themselves,
or silk gowns and Valeneiennes laces
for their wives and daighlters. BTut
the process of contraction went on;
the purchasing power of the masses
of the people continued to diminish,
and then the merchlants besan to
finod bosiness falling off; poverty and
want were already among the people;
merchants began to fail; enterprises
of all kinds were suspended. Wise
acres began to talk of tihe troubles
brought on by over production. But
they could mot explain how it was
that if we had predoced too much
wheat, and corn, and pork, and rice,
and sugar, there were millions of
people amongst as who could get
neither wheat, corn, pork, rice nor
sugar to ear. Aod so the process of
contraeetion for time purpose of specie
reseaumption went on, the people
growing more destitute and misera
ble, alnd gold and bonds growing
more preeioeus every day. And now
we god the dfiercest symptoms of dis
content manifesting themnselves in
every portion of the country, threat
enhrg sai with riots, strikes and blood
shed. Yet, strange to say. neither
the Secretary of the Treasury, nor
the gold zings, national banks and
boadholders, at Isis back, seem dis
posed jo the least to relda their merI
eileas policy. They retuse to con
cmonde that the people have any
rights they are bound to respect.
It is now beyonsd question that the
porpose of the "money power" is to
permaoently change the character of
the government. Their object is to
establish a centralized government
controlled by elhe bouedholding inter
cat and the banks. The resolution of
the New York Senate is a "feeler,"
ass it wee, in thit direcric.n. It is
probably a 'little premature; hut it
clearly and onmistakably indicates
time real purpose of thie "umoney pow.
er and it lea i~icates tlhat un

remorseless policy until they fan into
