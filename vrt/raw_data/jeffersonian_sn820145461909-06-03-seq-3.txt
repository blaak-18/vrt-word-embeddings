The Political Transformation of Turkey
By P 4 UL S. REINSCH
Russian writer has said that
in future centuries the his
tory of the world will be di
vided at the time of the Rus-
A
so-Japanese war, before and
after. He referred to the awakening
of the Oriental races and the move
ment introduced into the vast masses
of the Oriental population.
When we think of the things that
have happened since 1898, we are in
clined to agree that an entirely new
era in the world is opening up. Won
derful transformations are in pro
gress, such as the transition in Pap
an and even more rapid reform in
China, considered hitherto impossi
ble; then the creation of a parlia
ment in Persia; and now, finally, the
establishment of a parliament and
constitution in Turkey.
As Turkey stands between the Far
East and Europe, it occupies a po
sition of particular importance.
The Turkish dominions have been
for several generations a storm cen
ter, and no European nation is ex
empt from the influence of the world.
The position of Turkey is favorable
in the development of the economic
unity of the world; if a strong and
progressive nation could hold her
territory, it would benefit largely
from this natural position.
To understand what has happened
we must go back to the be
ginning of the reign of Abdul Hamid
11. When he came to the throne
there was a strong Liberal movement
in Europe and Turkey was becoming
imbued with the ideas of the West.
It was the age of Liberalism. There
fore, the Liberal party in Turkey
naturally asked for a parliament and
a parliamentary constitution.
In response to this insistent de
mand Abdul Hamid granted a consti
tution in 1876, when Turkey was be
set by foreign dangers and when a
conference of foreign diplomats was
sitting on her affairs.
This constitution was based on the
experience of Western nations. It
granted a parliament elected by man
hood suffrage, and bestowed the Ot
toman nationality on all the classes
in the empire. Early in the next
year (1877) the parliament was dis
solved and the constitution suspend
ed, in which state it remained until
last summer.
The thirty-one years in the inter
val cover one of the most horrid
reigns in the history of the world —a
reign which for absence of enlighten
ed policy, for utter corruption, for
cruelty and bloodthirstiness, has been
equalled by but few in the history of
the world. The central factor was
the fear of the Sultan. It is notice
able how often an absolute monarch
has his fear played on by persons sur
rounding him. Abdul Hamid had
come to power in an irregular way
after two depositions. Murad V, his
elder brother, who was considered
the rightful monarch, was still living,
though deposed and imprisoned for
alleged insanity. The Sultan, fear
ing for his throne, imprisoned also
his younger brother, who is now sul
tan after remaining for twenty-five
years in a prison palace. The clique
which surrounded the Sultan played
so successfully on his fears that no
considerations of justice had force
with him against the advice of those
whom he trusted for his personal
safety. It was the case of the Rus
sian czar over again, but greatly ac
centuated. There were no public
parliamentay institutions which could
call his advisers to account. Public
opinion was suppressed and there was
no freedom of the press.
The manner in which the court
clique exercised government was by
a vast system of police supervision
and espionage. Spies were counted
by the tens of thousands. Every im
portant citizen had spies on his
track; the moment that he came un
der suspicion, he was liable to de
nunciation, exile, or decapitation.
Numberless victims were made to dis
appear in the quiet of the night with
out even the gemblance of a trial,
Whenever it was necessary for the
clique to act carefully in order to
make sure of a victim, an invitation
would be sent out for him to come
and receive some new rank. Such
letters meant not the advancefent,
but the suppression of the recipient.
At one time there were at least
20,000 political prisoners in the
frightful jails of Turkey. Nearly all
of these were men of the upper ranks
who had been indiscreet enough to
manifest their opposition to the gov
ernment.
There was moreover a vast system
of corruption from the highest offi
cials down. The terrible Armenian
massacres committed by the Kurds in
the mountains of Asia Minor result
ed not merely in the displacement of
one race by another, but in the de
struction of the agricultural value of
the land. This meant enormous eco
nomic losses to the empire. The
Kurds were, however, always able to
make peace with the central govern
ment. Though the state itself lost in
taxes and otherwise, the clique profit
ed through the bribe money which it
received from the marauders. In
foreign affairs the government was
also incapable of following any pol
icy but the traditional one of shifti
ness. As a result, the empire has
suffered great losses through the
breaking off of Eastern Roumelia,
Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia, Herzegovi
na, Cyprus, Samos and Egypt. In
the outlying regions of Arabia and
Asia Minor, the provincial govern
ments had broken down; murder
and bloodshed were of every day oc
currence. Turkey had become a buf
fer between Arabian dissension and
European aggression. It seemed
only a question of time when the Ot
tomans would be entirely expelled
from Europe.
The government founded itself on
force and based its faith on its mili
tary strength. The Turk is a very
good soldier, enduring the hardships
of war without complaint and obey
ing orders. A recent visitor reports
having seen a body of troops stand
ing in the market place from sunrise
to sunset in a drizzling rain. It
seems that the head official of the
village had not returned from his
summer place and had given no or
ders for their quartering. Without
a murmur they took it as a matter
of course that they should suffer for
the convenience of a single official.
The Turkish troops won the admira
tion of all military critics during the'
Greek War on account of their bra
very and endurance. But though the
troops were the force on which the
sultan depended, the camarilla did
not have the ordinary intelligence to
take care of this body. They allowed
pay to stand in arrears; they neg
lected to provide proper food. Grad
ually dissatisfaction and disaffection
spread in the army. There was every
possible reason for dissatisfaction—•
attacks from without, disintegration
within. Turkey was crumbling; con
ditions within the country were un
bearable. With all this mis-govern
ment there was added the racial ha
tred of the various nationalities, so
that life and property were nowhere
safe. Moreover, the governing clique
disregarded the most elementary
principle that the power upon which
the throne rested, at least should be
kept in working order.
The thinking portion of the popu
lation became increasingly dissatis
fied, but it lacked organization. It
was under many disadvantages. No
individual could afford to be out
spoken in his criticism. But the ex
iles were not idle. Most of them
were possessed of some property and
able to take advantage, of the oppor
tunities which lay before them in
Western Europe. As they studied
and traveled in Italy, France, Ger
many and England, they became im
bued with Western ideas of govern
ment. They were also thrown to
gether with each other, and in each
of the large European capitals there
'Sfcffersonian
were centers of Turkish life.
So “Young Turkey,” as the move
ment has always been called, began
and continued to grow in organiza
tion and importance. “Young Tur
key” is not a party nor are all its ad
herents young men. It is a move
ment, a movement to rejuvenate Tur
key, a movement through which a
new political and economic life is to
be built up, a movement of protest
against all the rottenness which ex
isted in the Turkish Empire. Tn
Turkey itself, it grew especially
among the army officers. It was an
organization composed of the upper
middle class, the class which has the
superior position in the army, the
class which is in control of large
business interests, and from which
under normal conditions, the higher
positions in the government could be
filled. In their political program,
the Young Turks demanded a parlia
ment and a constitution, responsible
government and popular - elections.
The revival of the Constitution of
1876 would have satisfied them, as
they are liberal and nationalistic in
their views.
Their method of organization was
to have small groups of not more
than five, this limit being imposed to
lessen the danger of exposure. Each
of these groups bad a representative
upon a central committee for the re
spective province. The central com
mittee of the Empire was located at
Salonica, in Macedonia. These com
mittees had no head and avoided all
formal organization, because should
their existence be discovered, it
would go hard with the individuals
who would be found at the head,
whereas, if all were on an equality,
it would be far more difficult for the
Government to punish them. This
explains the adoption of a very dem
ocratic form of organization.
It was among the Macedonian
troops that the movement made spe
cial headway. Macedonia had been
lately put under an international
commission. The Turks continued to
govern but subject to the direction
of a European commission. There
fore, here the conditions of disinte
gration were especially evident and
the Turks could see the inevitable
effect of mis-government.
We of the outside world had for
some time heard of the movement,
but being so accustomed to the ap
parently hopeless conditions, we
thought the reform party so abso
lutely in the minority that little
could be expected from them. Sup
posing that they should attempt a
revolution, they would fall an easy
prey before the strength of the ex
isting organized Government. The
events of the last year from July on,
have shown how little the world real
ized the true character and strength
of the “Young Turkish” movement.
The revolution in July was unexpect
ed and came about somewhat by
chance. An officer in Macedonia, a
prominent Young Turk, was sum
moned to Constantinople. He knew
what this summons meant and fled
to a fellow officer for protection.
The troops, officered by men in sym
pathy with the new movement, re
sisted his arrest, and the revolution
was on. The Sultan’s camarilla was
taken absolutely by surprise. The
members of the clique were at their
wits’ end and they speedily gave up
the battle to the “Young Turks.”
The constitution was revived, elec
tions were ordered; suddenly Tur
key had become a constitutional gov
ernment. It is important that we
keep in mind fwo things—the revo
lution was a movement of the army
and it was led by men of the upper
middle class. These were organized
as had been the men of the American
Colonies before the Revolution, with
a secure organization, ready to as
sume responsibility. The fact that
an army is used for political move
ments is dangerous to the party
which succeeds. Other people may
