A CASE OF PLAGIARISM.
3 The young couple stood on the bank
opposite the Gadfly costemnplating
that small house boat with something
less than a feeling of ownership -han
they had hitherto experienced. A fiery
little steamer went up the river, and
the waves, taking advantage of the
confusion, ran and kissed the green
bank and were off again before the
green bank had time to protest. From
the top deck of the Gadfly came a song
to the ears of Mr. Stewart, of Throg
b morton street, and of young Mrs.
Stewart, that 'they were beginning to
know quite well, albeit Miss Bagge,
the singer, had only been there since
the morning. Missm lagge accom
panied herself on the banjo, and ae
companied herself all wrong:
" l'm a little Alsbarmer coon,
An't been born very long."
"I wonder," said little Mrs. Stewart
-"-I wonder, now, how many more
times she's going to play that?'
"My dear love." said Mr. Stewart,
sitting down on the bank.
"Don't call me your dear love.
Henry, until that dreadful girl has
gone."
- "My dear Mrs. Stewart, what can I
do? I can't treat her as we brokers
treat a stranger who happens to stroll
into the house, can 1? You wouldn't
care for me to catch hold of her and
of mash her hat in and hustle her out of
a- the place."
* "I shouldn't. All you hare to do is
to be distant with her."
"One can't be very distant on a small
houseboat."
"I believe you like Miss Baggo still."
said Mrs. Stewart.
"I don't mind her when she's still,"
said Mr. Stewart. "It's when she
e bobs about and plays that banjo of
0 hers that she makes me hot.".
y The shrill voice came across the
e stream:
"Hush a-bye, don't you cry, mammy's little
darling:
Papa's gwine to smack you if you do."
"Boat ahoy." called Stewart.
The boy on the Gadfly came up from
somewhere and pulled over to them,
and conveyed them to the houseboat.
Miss Bagge, looking down from be
tween the Chinese lanterns, gave a lit
tle shriek of delight as their boat
bumped at the side of the Gadfly.
"Oh, you newly-married people," she
cried, archly, as she bunched up her
skirts and came skittishly down the
steps; "where have you been? Leaving
poor little me alone with my music for
such a time."
"Did you say music. Miss Bagge?"
"Yes, dear Mrs. Stewart. My banjo,
you know."
"Oh!" said little Mrs. Stewart.
"Afraid you don't likle plantation
melodies, Mrs. Stewart."
"I used to think I did, Miss Bagge."
.Stewart had gone along to get some
thing iced to drink and something in
the shape of a cigar to smoke.
"How things change, Mrs. Stewart.
don't they? I'm sure it doesn't seem
six years ago-hem-Mr. Stewart and
I and ma and two or three others came
up to Marlow. I think that was long
before your day, before you came over
from Melbourne, and we did really
have the most exquisite time."
"Have you looked through the even
ing paper, Miss Bagge?" inter
rupted little Mrs. Stewart, hurriedly.
"Oh, yes, dear, I've looked through
it twice. One or two most interesting
cases."
"Where did you put it? I want to
see what O'Brien has done for Middle
sex."
"I've dropped it somewhere," said
Miss Bagge. "Could the boy go up
for my trunk before it gets dark? I
left it at the station, and I shall have
some more things down next week."
"Next week!"
Miss Bagge put her hand to her
brown thin neck and gave a cough of
apology.
"1f I stay longer I shall have to run
up to town one day to do some shop
ping."
There was a pause. The rings of
smoke from Stewart's cigar at the
other end of the boat floated down by
them. The boy berow broke a few
plates and danced a. few steps of a
breakdown to cover the noise.
"Dear Henry! How the scent of his
cigar does remind me of old times! I
remember so well that night at Mar
low-"
"Miss Bagge, will you go and play i
something?" t
Miss Bagge went obediently and
strummed her banjo, and mentioned
once more that she was a little Ala
bama coon, and young Mrs. Stewart
ran hurriedly to her husband.
"'I'm going to quarrel with her," she
said, breathlessly.
"That's right," said Henry, calmly; 5
"anything to stop that row."
"I'm going to ask her to go back to i
town to-night, Henry."
"But. my dear, isn't that rather
rude?"
"Of oourse it is. That's why I am
doing it. You'll have to see her to the
station."
The private row was quickly and t
quietly over. When the last word had v
been spoken the self-invited guest I
begged ten minutes to write a letter,
and then she pronounced herself ready I
for Stewart's escort to the station.
"Sorry you are obliged to go. Miss 1
Bagge," said Stewart politely.
"It's an important engagement," g
said Miss iagge, trembling, "or It
would have stayed. Good-by, dear
Mrs. Stewart. I dare say we shall
meet again soon." £
Now an odd thing happened. As t
Stewart handed his charge into the d
boat a letteri fell from her pootet on ii
the deck of the Gadfly. Mrs. Stewart,
in her usual good temper now that her a
hasband's old admirer was departing, t
i;lled to her as soon as she noticed the
letter; but Miss Bagg paid no atten- a
tion. It almost seemed that she did t

"CONSTAICc BAGO3a"
Young Mrs. Stewart sank down on
a low deck-chair and gasped and
looked across at the two.
"Well," she said, "this now is fear
ful."
There would be a good half an hour
before Henry returned, and in that
good half hour it was necessary to de
cide what was to be done. What was
quite clear was th-at the creature must
have had some encouragement to in.
duce her to write such a letter, and
"Why, she is taking his arml" she
cried.
Indeed, Miss Constance Bagge was
resting her hand upon the arm of Mrs'
Stewart's husband. Henry was carry
ing her banjo, and, looking baclk,
laughingly waved it at his wife.
"l)Does this mean," asked Mrs. Stew
t art, distractedly, "that they will
never come back?"
The letter seemed to explain his
slight diffidence in agreeing to the
lady's dismissal; it explained also why
Swhen Miss Bagge had that morning
made her unexpected appearance on
the bank hailing the boy with a shrill
"Hi!" Henry had only laughed very
much.
Mrs. Stewart summoned the boy.
"Yes, mem, there is a trine up liter
than this. It leaves Thames Ditton at
eleven fifteen, and you get to good old
Waterloo at about ten to twelve. And
I wish to Gawd," added the boy. pious
ly, -"that I was there nah. This plice
is a lump too quiet for me."
That would give half an hoerr to
speak her mind to Henry (if he did
come back), just half an hour to ex
tract from him a confession, and then
a rush for the last train up. At 1Water
loo she could take a cab to Uncle
George's; and if Uncle George couldn't
see her througlh, why, nobody could.
Uncle George was an agent general.
He was a stern man, and he treated
everybody as severely as though they
were his fellow-countrymen.
The white-flanneled figure came back
to the riverside.
"He has managed to say good-by,
then?" said Mrs. Stewart, fiercely. "I
should like to have seen the parting."
Henry came on board and want
straight to her, and, with the assur
ance of new husbands, kissed her neck.
"She's an impossible creature," said
Stewart. lie sat down beside his wife
and took an evening paper from his
pocket. "I believe she took the extra
away with her. I've had to buy an
other."
There was something in little Mrs.
Stewart's throat that prevented her
for the moment from starting her lee.
ture.
"She wasn't so bad, you know," he
went on, "in the old days . Of course
I was a mere youth then. But now she's I
too terrible for words. I suppose if 1
girls don't get married they get warped 1
and changed."
"I want to speak to you, Henry," she a
said, steadily.
"Oh, bother that boy," he exclaimed.
"We must got rid of him, dear; he's a i
nuisance."
"It wasn't about the boy."
"Not the boy? Well, then-Hullo'
Here's a funny case."
She went on very quietly:
"I want to speak to you seriousl3
Harry, about a matter that has, by ac- I
cident, come to my notice. I don't
want to seem to bother too much about
it, and I suppose if I were as free as
some women are I shouldn't mind it
in the least. But my mind is quite <
made up."
He was not listening, but her head
was averted, and she went on.
"I have left the keys in the bed
room, and my account book is totaled C
up to date, with the exception of the e
bill that came in to-day. There is no 1
reason why we. should have any high I
words." '
"I beg your pardon, dear. I haven't I
heard a word that you were saying."
He had found the news page in the
evening paper, and was reading with /
much interest a diverting breach of
promise case.
"I was only saying"-she raised her 6
voice to a pitch of distinctness- f
"that"- d
"Look here; here's an idiotic letter '
the girl writes to the fellow." t
"I don't want to hear it, thank t

"Yes you do. Listen. This is how t
it goes: 'Just as the wind sighs for t
the seashore, so do I sigh for you.' i
Why, the wind doesn't sigh for the a
seashore, does it?"
"Go on, please," she said quickly; v
"read the rest of the letter. Is it re

"Look for yourself, dear. It's too d
funny for words. 'So do I sigh for t
youn. Can you imagine what you are d

indeed my king, and you know that I r

"Why," cried Mrs. Stewart, "that's t
word for word the same."
"'As what?" I
"It doesn't matter, dear.'"
She took from her blouse the letter
that the disappointed Miss Bagge,
with deplorable lack of originality,
had copied from the evening paper.
"Don't people do some silly things,
Winifred, dear, when they are in love?"
She took a marguerite from the
bowl on the table and stuck it in his
hair. Then she tore up the letterand a

FOLLY OF THE SUGAR TRUST.
the Bash Bluft f a Protemtlua-Festere
aeesopoly.
The threat of the sugar trust to
close its eastern refineries was char
acteristic of the methods of that
mopopoly. It was made by Mr. H. 0.
IHavemeyer, the president of the trust,
within a few days of the meeting of
congress, and Mr. Havemeyer based
the pretended necessity for closing
the refineries and turning thousands
of men out of employment on the
probability of the passage of the frEe
sugar bill, which, having gone through
the house of representatives at the
last session of congress, is pending in
the senate. At the time when this
threat was uttered there was small
probability that the free-sugar bill
would be passed by the senate. There
was then no evidence, so far as the
public knew, that tbh hold of the trust
on the senators who compelled the
surrender to its denmands was weak
ened. But Mr. Havemeyer's interview
has evidently greatly discredited the
trust in Washington. It has aroused
a widespread indignation against the
trust., which, coupled with the popu
lar verdict in the country, --and..es
pecially in his own state, has com
pelled even the obstinate and cynical
Senator Smith to denounce the friends
by adhering to whom last summer he
incurred much deserved odium.
The threat was clearly ill-timed, and
otherwise indicative that to Mr. Have
meyer, as to other men who have been
cleverly and astutely defiant of the
public sentiment in favor of morality,
and whose success in corruption or
selfish greed has seemed unbounded,
there has come a time when folly has
taken possession of him. So cruel and
unnecessary was his threat that the
president felt constrained to mention
it in his message, and to express a
willingness, in view of it, that the
especial protection enjoyed by the
trust should be repealed.
Mr. flavcmeyer apparently thought
that he had only to drive his working
men into the streets to stay the hand
of the advocates of free sugar. But he
forgot, or never realized, the almost
universal hatred which his own and
his associates' conduct in Washington
had inspired. He and they were among
the most potent factors of democratic
defeat. The country believes the trust
purchased protection from the sen
ate, and that German, Brice, Smith and
some others were practically its agents.
It knows from the testimony of the
two Llavemeyers and Searles that the
trust habitually corrupted both polit
ical parties. It has reason to know
that the trust is amply protected,
and that if it has lost money or
failed to make it in the last three
months-it is because it was too confi
dent if its power to postpone the oper
ation of the act until the 1st of Jan
uary. More important than all else is
the knowledge that the business of re
fining sugar is conducted in this coun
try more cheaply than anywhere else
in the world, and that the trustcan
actually pay some duty on its raw ma
terial and still compete with the Ger
man and English refineries in the mar
kets of the world. It knows from
Henry O. Havemeyer's own testimony,
given in 1880, that American refiners
do not need protection.
The indignant outcry with which
Mr. Ilavemeyer's threat was greeted
was followed by the return to the
refineries of the few workingmen
who were discharged. This was a con
fession that, instead of being under a
stress of civil circumstances, the trust
could not afford to stAd production
even for a few days, and for the pur
pose of preventing the passage of the
free-sugar bill.
The resultof all this ought to inspire
the senate to do something towards
curing one of the grossest scandals that
evertainted it. The differential duty at 1
least should be abolished. If this much I
is accomplished the country will be
grateful for Mr. Havemeyer's folly.

SUGAR TRUST SENATORS.
A Monopoly Created and Supported by I
Repubtlesas.
By a vote of twenty-three to twenty- 1
seven, the United States senate re
fused to strike out the discriminating 1
duties in favor of the sugar trust. The
vote showed clearly the friends and
the enemies of the trust. Of the I
twenty-three votes to strike out the f
differential duty in favor of the sugar -
trust, twenty-two were democrats. Of
the twenty-seven votes against strik
ing out, twenty-four were republicans c
and populists. I
The monopoly of the sugar trust i
was begun by republican legislation. 1
It was one of the essential features of i
the McKinley bill, which made a high c
discrimination in favor of the sugar e
trust. That discrimination was re
duced by a hard fight, and the effort
to abolish it entirely received only one r
republican vote. t
The sugar trust makes a profit of
ten million dollarsa year by its privi- t
lege of laying a tax on the people of a t
fraction of a cent on every pound of t
sugar they consume.
The United States government au- r
thorizes the sugar trust to collect t
from the people an annual income ten t
times as large as that which it costs to d
run the whole government of this city. a
While on one hand the United States t
favors the sugar trust by its protect- t
ing tariff, on the other hand it per- i
mits the sugar trust to oppress its ls- a
borers and to close its refineries and n
still more to raise its profits from the b
people. r
The test vote of the senate shows
who the friendsof the sugar trust are. c

POLITICAL HERESY.
What a Republleas Jeurmal Says of Me.
The defeat which prohibitory pro
tection has lust sustained in the re
publican congressional campaign com
mittee is significant. It came on the
question of continuing the committee
neadquarters and the maintenance of
its literary bureau until March 15
next. This was the proposition of
Chairman Babcock and the other lead
ers of the moderate wing of the party
and it was opposed by the high protec
tionists under the direction of
Boutello of Maine. The moderates
were successful by a large majority.
For three months more the head
quarters will be kept open, and dur
ing this time literature on the tariff
question will be sent out to republic
ans or others who ask for it and the
campaign of education be continued.
Just what happened in the congres
nional committee would happen in
caucus if the matter were brought be
fore the entire republican delegation
of both branches. High protection,
the protection which is understood by
the term McKinleyism, would be
beaten four or five to one on a vote of
the whole body of republican members
of congress. McKinleyism denotes
high protection-protection in some
places very close to the prohibitory
point, and in many places much nearer
that point than is necessary for the
producer, fair for the government, or
just to the consumer. The term is con
crete and specific, and the wayfaring
man, though a fool, will know precise
ly what it means.
.tceinlcyian Us not republican doctrins
and never was. Undoubtedly itf the
republican masses of the country were
permitted to vote on the McKinley
bill just after it was put into shape
they would have rejected and condemned
it by a vote of at least three to one.
A man can be a sound and consistent
protectionist without believing that
the highest duties are always the best
duties. All the protection which the
really representative men of the party
ever wanted was that which would off
set the lower wages paid abroad.
There are, it is true, in the republican
party. as there were in the whig party,
men who think that nothing whatever
should be admitted to the country
which can be made or raised here, no
matter what the price here is, but in
the whig days those men were neaer
allowed to dictate tariffs. The re
publicans, too, kept them in the back
ground until recently. They had no
hand in the framing of the Morrill bill
which passed the house in 1860 and the
senate' in February, 1801. The duties
in that act, of course, 1were subse
quently increased, but that was during
the war, when an impost was put on
everything that a tax-gatherer could
reach. After the war the duties
started downward, and they kept on
going down until 1890. Then the im
port exclusionists and abolitionists
got control of the ways and means
committee, framed the McKinley
tariff, and the party was overwhelming
ly and deservedly beaten in that year
and in 1809 as a consequence. No
tariff will ever again be framed on
the 1890 lines. There is an Irrepressi
ble conflict between McKinleyism and
republicanism. McKinleyism is a
relic of barbarism, a survival of the
dark ages. It is political heresy.

WEDDING OAKE COMES HIGH.
One Hundred Dollars About the RIght
igure in FPashienable Life.
The most costly single item in the
well conducted wedding of to-day is
the cake, without the proper amount
of which no self-reslpecting woman
would dare call herself a bride. It is
made as of yore, by the good old-fash
ioned black cake recipe-very heavy,
rich and dark; but no bride of any up
to-dateness has a large and formidable
iced confection of this kind at her wed
ding. The stately center piece has
been broken up into small boxes of
watered white paper or silk, tied with
ribbons and stamped with her maono
gram. These are placed so
conveniently at the wedding
that every guest may secure one as a
souvenir, and those at a distance ex
pect boxes of cake by mail as the con
ventional adjunct to the invitation.
All this costs the bride's family full
one hundred dollars and more when
they arrange it for her in anything
like good style. The most approved
cake boxes are about three and a half
inches square, with an attached lifting
lid. They are either covered with pol
ished cream white paper or white satin.
The paper boxes, when filled with cake
that is first wound in waxed paper and
then tin foil, tied with ribbon and
stamped on the lid with the initial let
ters of the bride and groom in gold,
cost sixty-five dollars a hundred. The
white satin boxes ought not only
to bear the monogram in gold
or silver, bu', on the lid must be
tied a bit of orange blossomn, and the
confectioner charges just one dollar
and twenty-five cents for each of these
daintily prepared packages of cake.

ists. The gods are clean and pure. and
those who are not clean and pure can
not but forfeit the protection of the
gods. Those who are not protected by
the gods can easily be attacked and in
jured by the evil and unclean spirits,
and hence ths idea of danger came to
be associated with the idea of unclean
ness. This is, perhaps, made plainer
by some concrete case.
When I was a young boy the custom
of eating beef began to spread. As
blood was regarded as unclean, and
also as Japan had been a strong agri
cultural country,there was a very deep.
rooted disinclination to eat beef. In this,
of course, one has also to recognize the
influence of the vegetarian principle of
Buddhism. But to anybody who had
ever tasted beef, it was so delicious
that lie could hardly control his natilr
al appetite by his religious scrupl. s.
My father was one of those who knew
its taste, and so now and then we used
to treat ourselves to beef. iBut where
did we eat it? We did not eat it inside
of the house. We cooked and ate it it
the open air, and in cooking and eat
ing we did not use the ordinary
utensils, but used the special ones
kept for the purpose. Why all these
things? Because beef was unclean, and
he did not like to spread this unclean
ness into our house wherein the "gods
shelf" is kept, and into our ordinary
utensils which might be used in mak
ing offerings to the gods. The day
when we ate beef my father did not
offer lights to the gods, nor say even
ing prayers to them, as he did usually,
for he knew he was unclean and could
not approach the gods. Then my
mother, who did not and could not cat
beef till very recently, did these things;
and I, who used to partake of the new
dainty dish, often went to bed feeling
as if I was unclean and subject to dan
gers.-N. Kishimota, in Popular Science
Monthly.
A Dreadful Revenge.
"Do you remember," said Mr. CawV
ker to his wife, "that when the lovely t
Miss Beeson jilted young fMr. Spudds, :
five years ago, to marry Mr. Dilling
ham, the rejected one swore a mighty c
oath to be revenged on his successful
rival?"
"'Yes," said Mrs. Cawker, "I remem-I t
ber it well; but such threats never I
amount to anything."
"In this case they did. Spudds has t
filled fat the ancient grudge he bears I
Dillingham."
"He hasn't killed him, has he?" 1
"Oh, no. His torture is more.linger- It
ing than that, my dear."
"What has he done?' i
"Dillingham told me of it himself,
and I must say that the scheme does a
-ipudds credit in its ingenious cruelty.' t
"But tell me what it is."
"Well, after the wedding, Spudds a
went and allied himself with a fash- c
ionable store in the city, and ever I
since then he has occupied his time in t
preparing the most perfectly irresisti. a
