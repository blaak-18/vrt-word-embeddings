promise. If his attitude was not in ac
cord with the people he wanted to
know it so he could inf-cmn congress.

r,-!:my. A number of senators who

Mr. l ncjmas had started the debate
Wednesday by criticising the pending
bl as being too liberal ant when the
subject came up Thirsiay Mr. Gal
Hoger aliverted to his remarks and
said that be was in favor of an amend
ment covering this question as strong
as could he drawn. The influence of
the Mormon church over politics oc
copied a large share of the debate
which Mr. Hale characterized as inter
esting, valuable and startling, because

organization "exerting itself as a dom
inant, potential force." over the mind
and action of its f.llowers. which
should he taken into account in future
legislation.

polygamist could occupy any high po

eretsed in New Mexico and Arizona.

Mormon peep. whouexer it so desired.
TRUST QUESTION.
One Said Regulation lA'i- Intended, but
Others 'al'e. I 't i-in'.
Washington, Feb 1 -The anti-trust
bill debate, which open in the house
Thursday, did not dtve lop much ani"
mation, although there was a fairly
large attendance in the galleries. The
rule under which the house was to op
erate, however, precipitated a lively
discussion. The Democrats protected
vigorously against the rule for consid
eration of the bill because it did not
permit them to secure a record vote
on a substitute, but the Republicans
replied that they were willing to ac
cept the responsibility. The bill to ex
pediate anti-trust prosecutions occa
sioned no debate. It passed the house,
as it did the senate, without a word of
debate. Mr. Powers of Massachusetts
(Rep.) made the opening argument for
his side of the house on the judiciary
committee bill and Mr. Clayton of 1
Alabama (Dem.) opened for his side.
The former contended that the pend
ing measure was a step in the direc
tion of regulation of trusts, while Mr.
Clayton Insisted that it was a sham
and pretense and that the bill, feeble
as it was. never was intended to go
on the statute books.
