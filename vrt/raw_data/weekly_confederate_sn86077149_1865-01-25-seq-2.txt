! If all the force had been employed from the
time ot the enemy's landing until the final

we should regard it as a misfortune cf war to
'A bcrne uncomplainingly. As it stands, it
j is an enigma which we cannot explain.
j Gcrerfd Hood returned from his campaign
' with a le ss of not exceeding four tbonsand
; n t-n while that of the enemy was four-fold.
; He completely out-generald Thomas in every
1 movtm.ut; to such au extent, indeed, that
favorite commander has been relieved oy
tht Washington War Department. He suc
ceeded in raising a large number of recruits
I iu South and Western Kentucky, who, un
I 'r General Lyon, still occupy that State.
'That he wusjLot wholly successful and t at
! his name U not now hailed as - ore of the
thiefestof our military leaders, is attributable
j to the accident at Nashville, against which" no
; human intelligence could Lave provided. He
1 has already suffered from much undeserved
! . bliquy, but he bears all the opprobrium as
' the good and gallant andtrce soldier that he
k, should do. He quietly remarks that he
; knows i'ae penalty attending failure is ihe
carping ciiticism and unqualified censnre of a
! i .,ty public. But he is willing to cheerfully
abide his time.
With the s-piiit of his coble army unbroken,
with arti ltry sufiieient for a force of fifty
. thcusand men, with suboteiinate commanders
who repose the greatest cr nGdence in him,
! General Hcd awaits an opportune moment
j responsible for the fall of Frrt Fisher. The
L truth is, the respousiliiiry of-this sad d'aastein
Ires, we.wiil now, in justice to .that gallant
officer, say he mooe a reeonnoissai ce, au t re

have with pleasure and interest followed :he
