stood the test of

and sustained by its remarkable cures.
So mild as to be safe and beneficial to
children, and yet so searching as to
effectually purge out the great corrup

It is an excellent restorer of health

Even where no disorder appears, people
feel better, and live longer, for cleansing

renewed vigor and a new lease of life.
