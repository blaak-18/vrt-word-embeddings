Railroad Benefits.
Last week we began our series of
articles upon the benefit--cash bene a
fits, to accrue to our farmers from the a
railroad. Our last item was the sav- ii
ing upon our cotton sales of the one- e
roes drayage charges. Now suppose p
we continue to enumerate these say- t
ings, which are certain to occur upon p
the opening of this road.
Let as tmrn our attention now to b
the purchase question, a question as a
equally interesting as that of the sale b
of our produce. The greater bulk of ti
this cotton crop of ours goes for the II
purchase of merchandize in the shape a
of tood and clothing, to our New Or- tI
leans Merchants. We will say that a
the entire crop sells for $1,200,0lo0, a
of which we spend in the city $600,- 1.
000, and pay upon that a commission ii
of 21 per cent, to say nothing of the a
rebates paid to Commission merchants e
by sale houses, (which can be safely t
averaged at five per cent.) This 21 t
per cent must be reduced to 11 also, t
making' a saving there of $7,500 1
yearly. These figures look startling,
but my one can make them for him- p
self, and will see that we are correct. t
Where shall we place this amount v
as a credit? Not to the bonds, for 1
the saving already enumerated, over- t
pay yearly the tax to be lo vie&, for 1
principal and interest' and leave a
margin of $5,500 to which anmount .
add the $7,500, and we have the r
snug sum of $1,000, on the "penny t
saved, penny earned' plan. Nothing c
more, nothing less. Any one could t
go on at this rate and show conclu
sively to the mind of aay well think- I
ing person, what benefits the railroad t
would do, beyond that of the immi- I
gration to our lands.
Here now are figures which demon- f
strato the fact that the construction ,
ofthlis roaide instead of costing money t
to the taxpayer, by reason of the
blindsnaked, actually pay tAos bonds t
and $13,000 per year besides, to the
planters and farmers of Natohitoches .
phibih. Why then should men argue t
that tire 'patronage of the people a
should be suffiielent inducement for
eapftalidts to construct lines of trans- I
portation to move crops and supplies,
heilrsn lgutes show that the applica- I
tion should be the other way. -
" Suppose we consider other banelfits I
which we are at present debased from I
enjoying, by reason of the want of I
quick transportation and "demand- 1
inug" markets. We have as fine fruits I
raised in this parish as any in the
State-we have numerous paying farm I
production-provided the road is built I
which could be cultivated with easy
labor and great profit. Irish and I
sweet potatoes, early vegetables, -&e., I
would all reach the Northern mar
kets of St. Louais, Cairo sad other 1
places, from thins, fatrearlier than their
own- -ising and thereby eommand I
thb "early pries." In fact we firmly
believe that in this inastance the profite
woald be as great as that of oar eot
ton-certainly, counting the labor.
The old and yuong ladies with their
chickens, eggs, ,butter, honey and:
other "home" productions, would
never fail to sfind ready purchases for
them all, right at their own doors,'
and that to, for miles away from the
direct line of the railroad route.
Another and greater question for
oar eonsideration, should be that of
the enhancing, or ratlher placing a
eal w poa oear lauds. At present they
aro of nominoal value-that i., with
out price. Oar people are poor and
in debt; they .owEi lands that are
worth nothing, save for a support,
hardly tuit, the ands are as good
's. any l the world. Constrnct this
roadand you at once create a de
mand, and that fixes a value at once.
If peolple do not desire to sell their
Ilands, sogood, they can at least br
Irow money upon them with whieh to
.lmprove and render them still more
valuable. Certainly no one desires

Talk to Farmers. R
The policy pursued by our Louisi
ana friends, which cannot be charged te
as being confined to any one locality si
in the State, but is more persistantly in
clung too in some, than others; is a ec
policy admitted by nill thinking men vi
to be ruinous to our material pros- ti
perity. b;
The failure of our crops are not to w
be attributed solely to the seasons, di
nor yet to the enemies of our staple; i
to prove which we will state that in fr
the former instance, crops yielding st
largely-crops as good as can be de di
sired, have passed successfully do
through a three mouths drought and
are to-day as blooming as the rose, sl
whilst others, with or without rains, w
have failed entirely-in the second qi
instance, that of the distraction of L
oar cotton crops-some have succeed- ,
ed in making fine yields during all ,
that dark and dreary era of the ea- l
terpillars. This can be attributed to to
but one cause, that is superior culti -
vation. tl
We learn from our most eminent
practical farmers, that the prepara- c,
tion of the soil "Is half the crop," and
we heard a friend of ours say, a few
days since, and that most truthfully, r
that "good strong teams wre the 01
whoic battlo."
The policy before the war was to
raise more bales of cotton than your o
neighbor, and to do so we depended i
entirely upon the number of acres i a
cdltiration. This 'imore bale" ques- o
tion was amusingly demonstrated by n
"Porte 'Crayon' in Harper's Monthly ti
in 1855. When he showed' the cqr- -
toons of the "ten bale man" and "the
hundred bile mani"
There has been a great advance
fromii tis "acreage'" system of cultl
vation -an; advance as marked as
that-frosn wooden to iron sad steel

Reorganization of Democracy.
Many of our north Louisiana con- nC
toemplries are strennously and per
sisteatly advocating an early and
immediate organization of the Demo
cratic party of this State. The ad
vocates of the question are mostly D
those whose "calling is made sure," i
by reasoil of their living in localities
where the white clement largely pro
domirates. We propose to speak our
mind plainly on this matter to our
friends, for we presume they are all
such, and we can assure them that no
desire on our part is intended, to
dampen the movement.
Our experience in politics has been
short, as we are young in years, but F
what we have learned has been ac- Fi
quired in the hard, hard school of Ci
Louisiana. Elderly persons, sages in
wisdom and political knowledge-to
whose superior qualifications we bow
with due defferenee-are, we are sorry an
to say, to prone too believe in the sin.

this whole attempt to organize the v
party at this earlyday, has been sans- Ih

Some monthe since a cal for al1
meeting of the radical party at Mon yo
roe'was issued, with an appointment tbh
of delegates made to attend-this 00
may fall through, but it served its yi
purpose, thtt of alarming a few Dem- ce
oerats to a tear of the Radicals be
ing before tem in the canvass. Some he
attempt at apall for an organization pC
of the Democracy was at that time pr
made, which met with. mucht opposi- a
tion, for many and obvious reasons.
This move we also thought had quiet- m
Ied down, as also thought our oppo- pi
snets, wld met in Monroe not long
since, an( after adopting a series of
wishy-wehly resolutions, signifying
nothing, uljoumred; x11 thus ad- In

The lection in Mississippi will take a

experience from her. Our predictions tl
t have kee, and are still, that the c
Democratic ticket will be over- n
whelmuingly defeated, because the no- e
gro, the carpet-bagger, and the seal- c
awag are all combined in one solid a
mass tlst justice and reason have b
no power to bleak. Mr. Lamar with

The action of the Central Commit
Stee of de Democratle party of Louis

Sweek in New Orleans, was what will
be considered right and proper by
our people. The people of North I

Let any of our planters examine Cal
the sales of cotton and see if what we
say is not correct. You save ware- eC
house charges, drayage in New Or- ho
leans, brokerage, river insurance and thi
1 per cent commission, for mind
you, New Orleans is striking out for
the great Texas trade, a trade of 500,
000 bales, and to compete with New
York ana other markets, all these ex
cessive charges most be lopped off. P
Trade seeks that market which at
hampers it as little with charges as m
possible, as well as that where its Of
produce gets the best price. We defy fo
a refutation of these figures-they in
speak for themselves, and all arg.a th
ment by word against them are sim- th
ply factions. at

Winnebago War Hoop! th
We have been laboring under the in
lmpression for the past ten years, of
that the war was over-that it had m
eased on our part ten years since,
upon a bright April day, we are well
aware; but it seems to is that the 1I
Winnebagoites are just begining to to
get their "backs up"-started out "to 8
scalp" ex-President Davis-at long 81
range, about the sanme range, we
opine, that moet of those 'iwarriore'

late nupleasatesta . i
We have had all along some lin- t1
I goring doubts(sad lave them still) of
Sthe propriety of placing our leadig
men in positions to be thus publicly ti
insulted. Mr. Davis aecepted this
invitation in all kindness of heart, as
it was no doubt extended him, but he a
and the Committee, both, mistook the q
valiant braves of the Winnebago d
tribe. The howling of these puling 4
cowards is pitiful to hear, and if the
men of the North are not lost to de- i
cency, they must feel ashamed of the IU
