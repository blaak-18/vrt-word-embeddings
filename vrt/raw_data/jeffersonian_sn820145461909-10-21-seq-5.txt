SPLENDID SUGGESTION.
Dear Sir:—l am enclosing you
herewith a clipping from the Mont
gomery Evening Journal of the
fourth, which you will note has ref
erence to a new idea that I am advo
cating which has for its purpose the
permanent relief of widows and or
phans of this community.
I am satisfied that you will agree
with me that this is a capital
scheme. I believe that I will suc
ceed in getting some of our property
owners interested in the proposition.
If some of these fanatics who are
raising a hue and cry about the suf
fering Celestials would turn their at
tention to some such scheme as this,
they would bless themselves and pos
terity and their names would ever be
cherished by all real Christian men
and women.
I tell you, Mr. Watson, “Home Mis
sions” is the battle-cry; let us nail it
to the masthead of our endeavors and
fight for the idea with all our ran
somed powers—and never let up in
season nor out of season; never lay
our armor down as long as there is a
suffering widow and a hungry child
between the two oceans.
The brave and noble fight which
you are making against these fanatics
is something that every true patriot
ought to be proud of. Your articles
are a positive inspiration, and I feel
that such a pen as yours wield
ed in defense of home missions will
be the most potent factor to create
the right line of thought in the minds
of the people, and to destroy the Tro
jan horse of foreign mission iniquity.
What do you think of the proposi
tion, Mr. Watson, to build neat little
cottages for the poor?
I believe that it is a most whole
some idea, and will endeavor to get
our capitalists interested in the
scheme.
Wishing you an ever-increasing
measure of success in the magnificent
wo r k in which you are engaged, and
assuring you of my great respect and
admiration, I am,
Most sincerely,
L. A. ODOM,
Captain Salvation Army.

“The engineers find Gatun Dam

PROBABLY
There is not a reader of The Jeffer
sonian who is suffering from a Kid
ney, Bladder or Uric Acid Ailment
but what would like to get away
from costly, heartbreaking failure,
the grinding misery of it all and find
a remedy which when fixed and
ready to take would cost no large
sum, be entirely harmless, would
not taste very bad and withal per
fectly dependable in most cases.
So, Mr. Publisher, I will ask you
to tell every such reader (man or
woman) that if they will at once
send their full and plain address to
me I will without charge of any na
ture be glad to direct them to the
remedy I so successfully used in my
own case and right in my own home.
Respectfully,

IN THE RACE FOR CONGRESS.
Dear Sir:—l thank you very much
for your kind letter of the fifth in
stant, and for the suggestion therein
contained as to my platform.
1 appreciate your Socialist article
very much; you have stirred them up,
I notice, all over this part of the
country. On last Monday 1 spoke to
a large gathering in Johnson county,
this State, and a reference I made to
your work in the Fifty-second Con
gress—and since that time as a
writer and speaker—brought a howl
from some Socialists present, who
came to me after I had concluded
and asked me if I was a friend to
Tom Watson and if I indorsed what
he had to say on Socialism. My an
swer was that 1 had indorsed all you
had said up to date, and that I was
expecting a strong article in the
monthly for October—and I would
venture the indorsement of it before
time.
Well, I am going to send you a
copy of my opening speech and plat
form as soon as I get it out, and I
hope you will have the time and space
to give the same notice in The Jef
fersonian, where you can do me a lot
of good. I will write you from time
to time and keep you posted on mat
ters in Arkansas.
I wish you good luck and hope I
may yet get to see you soon. With
love to you and your family, I am
Your friend,
BEN L. GRIFFIN.

In the window of a little book
store in Eighth Avenue, New York,
was recently heaped a great pile of
Bibles, marked very low—never be
fore were Bibles offered at such a
bargain; and above them all, in big
letters, was the inscription:
“Satan trembles when he sees
Bibles sold as low as these.”

“My first experience with
Dr. Miles’ Anti-Pain Pills
was a sample package handed
me. They relieved the pain
so promptly that I have never
been without them since. I
have given them to many
friends when they had head
ache and they never failed to
relieve them. I have suffered
with neuralgia in my head,
and the first one I took re
lieved me. They have cured
me of neuralgia. I would not
be without them.”
