Edlon at the Ca.
Thomas A. Edison acted a telegrapn
operator in New York a few nights
ago, for the first time in twenty-six
years.
Mr. Edison attended the Electrical
Exhibition and while there was asked
if he would receive the me to be
sent around the world by Ch 4noey M.
l)epl'W next Saturday night. The
great inventor said that while he was
Kperfectly willing to play operator for
one night, he had his doubt as to his
ability to do so, as it was years tince
he had tried to read a messageowr the
w i rc.
,'r\eral electricians and trrieams
doubted his ability to receive, acid
some jokingly said that they did not
believe that after so many years away
from a key he could distinguish be
tween a dot and a dash.
Mr. Itldion replied that while he
might have forgotten, he was certain
he would La, able to pick up his old ao
colmpliuhment with a little practice.
After the fluoroscope exhibition Mr.
Edi.,n accepted an invitation to try
his hand as an oiperator in the tele
graph room of the Journal. When he
entered the rooms, with the dozen or
more instrum.ents rattling otT messages
from all parts of the world, he glanced
around. smriled and said: O()h, I guess
I'm all right yet."
A key was selected. and pen,' ink
and telegraph blanks were given him.
The in trument commenced toclick and
Edison to make the usual cabalistic
signs.
'l'he crack ol",raturs who expected to
see the man who was bss of them all
thirty ,ears ago "-break" in his work,
looked on as Edison wrote without a
break.
When the signature was given, he
commnenced to repeat the message just
to see' how he could send.
'l-That's the tirst message I'vc re
ceived or sent in twenty-six yers,"
said he. as he leaned back in bis chair.
"-1 think I could receive or send if I
lived to be a thousand. I do not be
lieve a man ever forgets it. It reads
just like copper-plate, but it kept me
s'ratching to get it down. Now. if
those. fellows want to turn loose Satur
day night, why I guess they can."
A Phosphoreccent Tea.
A phosphorescent 5 o'clock tea was
recently given in Paris. The house
was darkened asi the only light used
came from the ceiling, floor, chairs,
teacups, plictures, flowers, etc. The
ladies wore pho:sphores'cent dresses,
and their facets and shoulders radiated
light. M henry, of the Academy of
Science, has invented a phosphorescent
starch which the women used. and
which imparted a moonlight radiance
to the face, which was extremely be
coming. It is discouraging to know
that the brilliance of the entertain
ment was all on the outside, and that,
as far as the conversation was con
cerned, it was just the same as at
other 5 o'clock teas which still retain
the charact, riatics that made Dr.
Holmes describe them as "gobble, gab
ble and git." Science can make the
chairs radiate on such occasions, but
not the conversation.
A Baccessful Doctor.
We take pleasure in calling your at
tention to the advertisement of Dr.
Marsh with regard to his cure for the
opium and morphine habit to be found
in another column of this paper. The
doctor has been engaged for twenty- 1
five years in this specialty, and is well 1
and favorably known for the cures he *
has made of these habits. We take 5
pleasure in commending him to any P
and all who need his services, having 0
been personally acquainted with him fi
for the past twenty-five years. t
Flalshlsg Teaches.
The German kaiser has turned his
late battle paintings over to the fa
monus painter of military subjects,
Herr Roechling, who will put a few d
finishing touches on the imperial mas
terpleces, and incidentally fit them for
exhibition. t
Any man who talks about his great 3
ability in any line is a fraud.

The Coleman syndiclate prepared a bill
I for the opening of the re.eruatlon andt
sent influential democrats to Washing
ton to pash its passage through con
gless. It passed Feb. 13. Coleman
immediately went to the mine. The
rights of the "sooners" being question
ed, it was decided that a nian must be
stationed at Marcus to receive the pews
t f the president's signing the bill and
then ride as fast as he could for the!
claim. The other morning McCool
was at Marcus awaiting such a tele
gram from Washington. The Russell
syndicate, equally clever, had Mark
- Gilmain at Marcus to perform a siml
lar service. Early in the afternoon the
expected telegram came. McCool and
f Gilmain started at a break-neck pace
on their lonely fifty-mile race.
Each covered the distance in less than
five hours. Gilmain got there first, but
he did not post any notices. Judge
Coleman was in possession. He had
with him an Indian and an Irishman
and they were prepared to use artillery
if needed to keep unwelcome visitors
away. Gilmain is quoted as stating
that he did not post any notices, be
cause he did not wish to get shot.
McCool soon came up and immediately
put up notices. The Le Fleur claim is
situated on Fourth of July creek and is
said to be the richest claim in the re
glon. It is estimated to be wdrth $2,
100,000 as it stands.
A Paper's Death.

mourning. In this journalistic funeral
procession will be a trio of weeping
lady compositors, who will sing in e
dulcet strains that sad, but well known
'him,' 'Down Went McGinty to the Bot

career of the deceased. The ceremon

No Money but Will Have Some,' in
which the entire audience will join and
the remains will be lowered into a grave
eof its own construction. Thus ends
a fair young life that promised every

YOUNG AT FIFTY.
l HOW A METHODIST MINISTER
g CARRIES HIS YEARS.
le From the Times, Oswego. N. Y.
in Probably no man is better known ,:
In more highly respected in Oswego, N. Y .
than the Rev. William Young. of tf
ry Methodist church. Mr. Young holds a
V- responsible position with the Osw,.go
j( City Savings Bank, where he has been
an employe for the past twenty years.
In the spring of 1894 Mr. Young
a looked as if his time on earth was lim
n. Ited but, instead of failing as was pre
t- dicted, he soon gained a more healthy
look and appeared stronger. As the
n- months went by this improvement con
rt tinued, until now he is as rugged and
m apparently as healthy as a young man
of thirty, although his gray locks de
a note a more advanced age. A Tim*-*
It reporter, determined to find out what
had made this great change, called
I upon Mr. Young at the bank and put
rl the question direct and received the,
Ic following reply:
Ii "In truth I am a changed man, and I
owe my present good health to Dr. VWil
liams' Pink Pills. In the spring of
r-94 I was all run down and had corn
Il menced to think that my time had
come. I had to ,be prescribed for by
nphysicians, and although I received
it teml,orary relief, the same old trouble
i. came back again and I was worse than
before. I had no strength or appetite.
and physically I was in a miserable
condition. After my work I would go
s. home, but the general lassitude which
11 hung over me left me without any am
bition, and when I would go to the table
d to eat. my appetite failed me and I
would have to leave without taking
, hardly any nourishment. My kidneys
were also badly affected, and I was in
n utter despair. One day, here at the
e bank. I happened to pick up one of the
local papers, and my eye fell on the ad
vertisement of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.
The advertisement gave a description
s of a man who, afflicted as I then was,
I had been cured by using Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills. I was not a believer in that
ekind of doctoring, but concluded as a
I last resort to try a box of the pills, mak
ing up my mind that if they did not
help me I certainly would not be in
I jured any. Going to a drug store I pur
k chased a box of Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills and commenced taking them ac
cording to directions. Very soon after
e I began to feel better and I saw I had
I made no mistake in trying the pills, and
e before the first box was emptied I felt
so much improved that I immediately
purchased another. I had taken seven
I boxes of the pills, and at the end of last
summer I felt I was entirely cured and
discontinued their use, but always keep
a box handy if occasion requires. I
I am now entirely cured. The lassitude
has left me, my kidneys are all right
and my appetite-well, you should see
me at the table. I am a new man
B again, and instead of feeling like a man
of fifty, which Is my age. I feel like a
youngster of twenty, and I give Pink
Pills the full credit for this great
change. I have recommended these pills
to several of my neighbors and ac
quaintances, who have been relieved of
their complaints."

Gladness Comes
W ith a better understanding 'of the
transient nature of tihe many phys
ical ills, which vanish before proper ef
forts--gentle efforts-pleasant efforts
rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge, that so many forms of
sicekness are not due to any actual d is
ease, but simply to a conatipatedcondi
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millionsof families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that itis the
one remedy which promotes internal
eleanliness without debilitating the
organs on which it acts It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene
flcial eftects, to note when you pur
chase, that you have the genuine arti
leo, which I manufactured by the Cali
foa PFig Syrup Co only and sold by
all reputable druggists.
If in the enjcyment of good health,
and the system is regular, laxatives or
other remedies are then not needed. If
ailioted with any actual disease, one
may be Oommended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxatirve,
one should have the best, and with the
well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Fi, stands highest and is most largely
sed and gives most general satisfaction.
