Sabbath Day. except those which in
their nature have to run
continuously on Sunday, giving their
men one day’s rest every week. The
reasons stated are purely and coldly
commercial, —the saving of time and
money in the long run by lessening
the wear and tear on machinery. It
is even suggested that the same con
servation process, applied to the hu
man machines, may increase their ef
ficiency.
It is hard to know whether to feel
contempt for such unblushing com
mercialism, or to admire the steel
trust for its refusal to place the Sun
day closing plan upon hypocritical
grounds. However, the substantial
benefit to the employees will be too
great to cavil at the reason for the
rest. The absolute necessity of the
Sunday rest cannot be controverted
and the law should enforce it as a
matter of imperative public policy.
It is beyond question that the men
who needs must work without cessa
tion cut short their lives by many
years and railroads, street car com
panies and all corporations which
take advantage of the fact that their
business must run on Sunday as well
as during the week to keep their em
ployees continually on the job are
public enemies in maintaining a sys
tem that simply makes widows and
orphans. By the employment of
enough men. and arranging neces
sary shifts, there is no reason why
each employee should not have one
day off in seven, whether it chances
to fall on Sunday or not.
Some systems do this, at least to a
certain extent. In Atlanta, however,
as one instance, no provision what
ever is made for any street railway
conductor or motorman to have any
rest, except at his own expense, and
usually then only under a sort of
protest. Eleven, or twelve, or thir
teen hours a day, week after week,
must not only shorten the actual
years of life, but renders church go
ing or social pleasure or comfortable
family life practically impossible.
And there are more systems akin to
this in greed and heartlessness than
there are systems which embody
saneness and humanity.

German government had submitted,
upon request, a line of statistics for
the information of those who, osten

When Germany framed its present
tarff, a trained body of men worked
for five years in adjusting the sched
ules. Consequently, it offered its
statistics in childlike belief that they
were extending a valuable courtesy.
For some reason, the careful and
conscientious Aldrich felt that the
public would be far better off minus
the information in question and deft
ly secreted the German document.
That should have ended the matter
happily for all concerned, but cer

to openly charge Mr. Aldrich with
wilful suppression of facts that

indictments were found by the Fed
eral Grand Jury at that point against
six or seven minor employees of the
American Sugar Refining Company,
anent which the counsel for that
company delivered himself of the fol

“The officers of the American Su

as the United States attorney can be
that these men and any others shall
be punished if they are guilty, and
that they are and have been co-oper

The discharge of these men from
the employment, in which they re
ceived a paltry few dollars a month
more than their fellows who had no
dirty work to do, has aroused more
general indignation even than the
gross frauds resorted to in order to
cheat that government which had al
ways pampered this trust. Mr. Loeb
has done well in exposing the fraud

of the criminality ceases with the
petty employees it will be another

another for the poor.

so far as the progress of the trial to

successfully resisted being dragged

Judge Anderson has already held
that in an action of criminal libel,
such as they are charged with, ex
press, not implied, malice must be
proved.
“Os course, there is back of this
their intent,’’ said Judge Anderson.
“The owner of a newspaper might
very well be held civilly for any
thing appearing in his pages, be
cause the men who put it there are
his agents; but when it comes to a
question of criminal liability for pub
lication of an article, it is a very dif
ferent thing. Suppose,” continued
the court, “the proprietor of a New
York paper should be off six months
cruising in his yacht. During his ab
sence there was a vicious article ap
peared in his paper. Should he be
held criminally? It does not appear
to me that he could be held crimi
nally liable.
“I am speaking about the ultimate
fact. If the owner is not present he
actually knows nohting of the publi
cation and could not possibly be held
guilty of the crime.”

The trip to Seattle would be, in
itself, a liberal education, and it is
hoped that many will utilize their va

Particularly ought our Southern peo

with those of the West, who are their
natural friends and allies. The two
great sections have common interests
and similar problems to work out,

steadily be strengthened. There is

much pouring of money by all sec
