Some Thoughts
N YOUTH it is natural to hope
and to look forward to bet
ter things, without any defi
nite idea as to how the better
I
things are to be brought about; in
middle age, we learn that the only
way to make things better is through
our own exertions, and that if we
want them to come, we must make
them come through the power of our
own work and will; in old age, w r e
learn that somehow there is often
a power that perverts even our very
best efforts toward better things, and
that they will not come, however
much we may try; then we become
either philosophical or bitter, accord
ing to whatever temperament nature
may have bestowed upon us. In any
event, we cease to hope or to expect
anything, and merely live out, or
bear out, the days, as they come,
caring little what they may bring, so
they pass quickly and give us the
final, eternal rest. Infinite, everlast
ing sleep, unconsciousness, inability
to feel anything, is the greatest bless
ing we come to care for. When the
end does creep upon us at last, there
is frequently a queer physical shrink
ing from dissolution, but as for want
ing to really continue in existence, it
seems to me that such a thing is al
most beyond belief. There may be
some people to whom life has been
something other than disappoint
ment, heaped upon disappointment,
but this comes only to the very few;
the vast majority, looking back over
life, can find little that one would
wish to go over again. Youth, what
is it? A ceaseless, restless, dissatis
fied yearning for what may (?) come.
Love, what is it? A mad, unsatisfied
desire for what will never be given.
Passion, what is it? A sinking into
self-indulgence. Reproduction, what
is it? A bitterness of disappointment
in our offspring. Work, what is it?
An eternal, unavailing grind. Death,
what is it? The most welcome guest
that can come into the average life.
Then, why should we keep this guest
at bay so long? Why not seize it
whenever we desire to stop the throb
and anxiety of living? Yes, why?
Who can say what is the force within
us that stays our hand when we would
drink the cup of oblivion and be done
with all the fret and worry of ex
istence?
There is but one possible answer
to all these questions, and that is
duty. The only possible thing that
can bring any satisfaction into life,
and that is but a grim, stern satis
faction, without any of the beauty
and softness of happiness, is the
sense of having tried in some meas
ure to do one’s duty. Not to have
done one’s duty, for no one suc
ceeds in doing this, but just to have
tried in some measure to have met
the obligation nature has put upon
us as men and women. As to what is
one’s duty, the individual must an
swer for himself, and in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, he will screw
duty into the semblance of some
thing he wants to do, such is the
perversity of human nature, and, of

course, will necessarily miss even the
grim satisfaction coming from obedi
ence to nature’s laws. Nature has
so made us that we must suffer if we
infringe upon her laws, yet she has
so made us that the most invit
ing things to us are those which
break her laws. It would seem that
she is determined that we must
either give up all sense of satisfac
tion in the doing, or we must be con
tent to suffer in the consequences.

Daybreak
4 S the faint dawn crept upward, gray and dim,
Z-l He saw her move across the past to him—
Her eyes as they had looked in long-gone years,
Tender with love, and soft with thoughts of tears.
Her hands, outstretched as if in wonderment,
Nestled in his, and rested there, content.
“Sweetheart,” he whispered, “what glad dream is this?
I feel your clasp—your long-remembered kiss
Touches my lips, as when you used to creep
In my heart; and yet, this is not sleep—•
“Is it some vision, that with night will fly?”
“Nay, dear” she answered; “it is really I.”
“Now little sweetheart, it is you, I know!
But I knew not the dead could meet us so,
“Bodied as we are —see, how like we stand!”
“Like” she replied, “in form, and face, and hand.”

Silent awhile he held her to his breats
As if afraid to try the further test—
Then speaking quickly: “Must you go away?”
“Dearest” she murmured, “neither night nor day!”
Close on her bosom, then, she drew his head,
Trembling. “I do not understand” he said;
“I thought the spirit world was far apart. ..”
“Nay!” she replied; “it is not now dear heart!

“Quick, let me close your eyes with kisses ... so .. .
Cling to me, dear! . . . His but a step to go!”
The white-faced watchers rose, beside his bed;
“Shut out the day” they sighed; “our friend is dead.”

ed for two reasons; first, that it is an
entirely adequate expression of the
experience of one capable thinker,
and as such worthy the attention of
others; and, second, in the hope that
it may lead some one to give us a
brighter answer, equally adequate, to
the riddle of the universe.
RECIPE FOR “RAISED” BREAD.
The recent Patten corner in wheat
caused flour to go up 40 cents per
barrel. In several large cities the
3 and 4-cent loaves were no longer
made, and the ordinary 5-cent loaves
went up to 7 cents. In New York
city (the city of the biggest “bread
line” in the world—the city with the
most nearly straved poor population)
the union bakers at this interesting
juncture struck for higher wages.
Proprietors refused, on the ground
that high flour and consequently di-
Z3l)e. 3effersonian
minished profits made “raised”
wages impossible. The bakers walk
ed out. Strike-breakers, “scabs,”
took their places, and in many—most
—instances the baking went on with
but little interruption—until the de
livery wagons started out with their
precious freight driven by non-union
workmen. As if their own condition
(out of work) was not bad enough
and with no consideration for others
poorer than themselves, who were
making honest money; utterly re
gardless of the starving, whom high
bread had rendered even more desti
tute, these strikers attacked the de
livery wagons, beat and otherwise
abused the drivers, demolished the
wagons, and, in view of hundreds
of people (most of them hungry,
many of them without the price of a
loaf) threw hundreds and hundreds
of loaves of bread into the muddy
street and trampled it into the mire.
Little children were there, and tots
in arms who held out skeleton hands
for just a crust that a gaunt-eyed
mother nor a frantic father could buy
for them!
“Man’s inhumanity to man!” Mr.
Patten evidently hadn’t cornered
that.
Can any sort of legislation remedy
such conditions?

“WHAT SAYEST THOU?”
(John viii, 3-11.)
We have saved the soul of the man
that killed,
We have turned to shrive the thief,
We restored the pride of the man who
lied
And we give him our belief;
But for her that fell have w'e fash
ioned hell
With a faith all stern and just—
It was so of old; and no man has told
What our Lord wrote in the dust.
We have sighed betimes of our broth
ers’ crimes
And have bade them be of cheer
For the flesh is w r eak, and the soul
grown meek
May yet read its titles clear;
But we draw away from the one
astray
As the truly righteous must.
She is cursed, indeed! —and we did
not read
What our Lord w r rote in the dust.
And the men who thieved, and w r ho
killed and lied—
Who have slain the woman's
soul—
We have worked and prayed and
have seen them made
All clean and all pure and whole—
But we drive her out with a righteous
shout
In our Pharisaic trust.
So the man goes free —but we did not
see
What our Lord wrote in the dust.

SAVE THE RICE WATER.
When the milk supply is limited
for any reason or there has been any
unusual drain upon it in the menu,
save the water in which the rice is
boiled. When this is allowed to
stand until jellied, it makes an eco
nomical substitute for milk that can
*be used in many dishes, instead of
the real thing.
In the making of cream soups, it
can be substituted for the milk, and
the trouble of thickening with butter
and flour is obviated. In casse-roles,
patties and many other viands it
adds to rather than detracts from
the richness. A cup of rice will yield
about a pint of jelly.—lndianapolis
