Our Duty.
No government, as history teaches,
can or will prosper when its citizens
or a large part of them, are restive
under rule from either real or imag
inary causes, and all revolutions
have sprung from some small begin
nings; beginrings that might, with,
wisdr, and forethought on the part
of rdTers and ruled, been easily set
tied, had such heen shown. We had
reached a point in the government
of Louisiana, wherein we could no
further suffer without ruin beyond
repair, and degredatiou without hope;
unable to retreat we were forced to
tare upon our enemies and try the
last issue with thewa. Our success
against Kellogg and his .government
would have been certain without the
interfer!ance of a more powerful phy
sical force, and when this was ap
plied, although vanquished, we pre
served our honor untarnished. The
government of the United States had
set up the Kellogg regime against
which we contended, and seeing after
two years trial, that we did not pro
pose to yield to it obedience, Gen.
'Glint deetlared to Mr. Zachelry, .that
he.inteuded to "infuse life into that
government." What is meant by
that, is certainly cltuprehensivre to
the dullest mind. Was it our duty
then to resist the genieral govern
ment, knoiring the certainty of failure
Certainly not. On the contrary, pru
dence, patriotism :,nd regard for our
families, demanded that we should
not commit self-sacrifice. The com
pro:mise was offered us, which we ac
cepted as wise mien should when we
could do no.. better, and now comes
oUR DUrr under the new order of
things, created it is trie, in opposi
tion to the will end wishes of a large
number of our most wise and patriot
ic citizens.
Our duty 'under the new position
Kellogg has now assumed towards
us, calls into play, not the feelings of
passion 'or prejudice, nor yet our ha,
tred to the man and the manner with
which he was foisted upon .us. Thew
are questions of the past-they are
our dead hopes and shonldbe bbhiied
Ifrom sight, for we can make nothing
by hugging to our bosoms their cold
4!nd inanimate corpses. We are now
called upon as citizens to yield obe
dience to a gqvernment however odi
ous, we have not the means or pow
er to subvert, and in assuming alle
gience we do not propose to abandon
our opposition thereto politically, but
simply for the sake of peace in fu
ture,.and.. our impoverished condition
at present, we propose, and it is our
duty to support the Kellogg govern
ment in all acts '.wlhiOK wee consider it
does to benefit our people, (the tax.
payers).
We find oniselves in a terrible po.
sition, it Is true, in choosing between
what our feelings prompt and our du
ty demnands we should do, but we
would not be deserving the name of
honest patriots should we hesitate in
a choice. The government we are
living under has plundered as, it is
true, has oitraged us, but will repin
ing and refusing to assist our friends,
when we. now control at least one
third of the government, and. hold
command of the purse-strings, will
this do'lHts 'good; or is it the pbliicy of
wise imen, patriotic citizens, to come
forwardsand build up the material
interests .if our State even should
these persons so obnoxioius, assist tms
in so doing. :
To our mind, our duty is clear.
We should aot hesitate in this matter
but come forward with our iunteli
geunce and wealth, and by this pr.es.-,
ence over-awe the ignorant and vi.
cious of the Republicans from com
mitting fauther aggteasi~i poii; . our
liberty and our proqperity, and keep
ouit from. representing as that rajA
eiousl class in our mids.'kndow asot
fcee seekets.. We can rest astAled
that unless the people om.ue forward
and iasume to control ..their: wa6af
tfAir, there will be found men reallv
ti.i gmsie cnMrol nlolegs'toeiwhose
aets we shall be at least respinsibl,
for, however reprehensible or hewer
er much we may disclaim thim.
Natchitoehes parsih has lost Uoth
iug by tile stand she took-in .174, or
by the compromise; .on thi contraryr
. we have gained much. We have suo
ceeded in ridding ourselves o~fboullt

Admitting that our good citizens
are williog to accord to Gov. Kellogg
their support in carrying opt such
measures for the beneglt of tile State
as may be enacted; the call session,
now being held in Neo Orleans is the
time.fotlhim to pass such laws with
the assistance of the Conservative
.House, that will tend to convince us
of his deterluiuation to work in his
official capacity for the beniit of the
people. Unless this is done and the
valuable tile wasted; and we be
"Condemn'd as needy supplients to,
wait,
r While ladies interpose, and slaves de
bate.'
then it cannot be expected of the tax
t payers to listen in future to. any of
Gov. Kellogg's protestations of his
good intentions. The support of the
people to his govornment, and when
we say support, we mean toleration.
depends upon his action and that of
his friends daring this call session.
So far, we have naught to complain
of save four days spent in organizing,
whieh should have been aeconmplished
in one ; six days remained after that
t and at this writing, (Wednesday)
three more have passed, and unless
something has been 'done ere this, ito

I Quite an excitement was produced
in our Otherwise quiet town, on Mon.
- day last, by a crazy negro "rnnuing
e a muck." After chasing ladies and
a childrenUthrough the streets with
f sticks and brickbate, and ,oming
- near seriously injuring tetm,;', h'e
e finally broke into T. Maonett's ibar
room,.on Jefferson street,, and pro
ceejied to demolish the establishnient.
n Deca'ters, bottles; &c., were btrcken
s and h lrled at an!y one, who attempted
f to enter, and Mouetto being in his
billiard room in rear of the bar, the
wild ieAn niAde a dash at him, armed
e with bottles of bitters- anid decanters
e of whisky, and proceeded to destroy
d the new billiard table :ii the saloon,
g lie was finally shot in' two ' places,
j but not dangerously, by Mopnette, and
SMtI', reneatux, our. efficient: Chief of
Police, arriving.at" .this. opportune mo
ment, he was captured and lodged in
The shooting nws done purely in
n self defence, and had the negrobeen
t killed, Monette (also a coloted 'lean)
would have been .justified. The re
n lationa. of these crazy people .who
r suffer them to run at iarge should be
i made to etit'~ for 'their coudult, as
t the chances to 'kill.omne .one by this
. an were good, and how some es
caped injuyyor deathl, is a mlraole.
o We are using oar humble efforts,
and will continto to do so, to bring
before the northern and western farm
er the fact of the productiveness of
the soil, the healthfulness of the cli
e mate and the general reasons for a
settlement in Louisiana; and if ably
seconded by the owners of land in
Natchitoeches parish,. we feel assured
of being able to induce some imni
Sgration here, at least.

The Compromise.
So far, nothing canu be said to de
tract from the wisdom displayed by
those Conservatives who supported
and carried through the award offer
ed by Mr. Wheeler. On the contrary,
their action is being each day more
and more applauded, and we venture
to assert that within the year the
most bitter opponents of this com
promise will be its firm and unyield
ing defenders. The defeat of Mr.
Wilts for Speaker of the House by
Mr. Estilette, may be safely placed
upon the ground that Mr. Wilts was
an extreme anti-compromise man;
vehement in his opposition to any
adjustment, and consequently did
tnot represent the views and opinions
of the majority of the Conservative
mnembers, when Mr. Estilette did,
hence the choice of the latter gen
Stlemen.
We should remember one thing,
that we are now striving to do good
" for Louisiana, and as we are unable
to do so as a party, patriotism de
mands that we should make consist
ent consessions to the Republican
) members of the Senate who really fa
v vor reform, and are willing to lend
° their aid -t good legislation. Mr.
Estilltte, undodbtedly' by his elec.
° tion as Speaker, would relieve those
persons of any apprehension, should
c it exist, of our intention to enter into
political legislation, and our latest
advices show that the appointment of
a conuitteos by the Speaker, and his
action thoughout has met with the ap
g proval of the entire body of Conser
va atives, and they now present a solid
ii front on all questions of reform. This
g removes any apprehension of a divis
e ion of our people.
r Taking the matter all in all, we
thinkour people have much'tnuse to
. cougratulate themselves [.upon, at
a least a quiet season of repose, and a
1 hope of future good legislation for
a our State.
d We learn that the hail storm of
. Tuesday did not extend any distance,
either above or below the city. Tihe
corn which was up, on Col. Wm. Ii.
ILevy's plantation, adjoining the low
d er end of the city, we understand,
If was entirely destroyed. This is bad,
. for Col. Levy is one of our model
u farmers, and we had hoped no back
set would occur to his fine and grow.
n iqg crop.
Gen. Phil Sheridan has gone to
Galveston to look into the Mexican
border affair. We hope his ken will
e be as'Idiseerning, and his action as
prompt as it was with us on the 4th
of January, 1875. We believe that
the Mexicans, however, are not term
ed "bandits" and consequently Sheri
dan is "not afraid.,"
g We call the attention of our citi
zeus living within the city limits to
,f the fact, that the election for Mayor
. and City Council, takes place upon
Sthe first Monday. in May. Do not
Sfail to boon hand, as you value your
3 city government.
i The people's favorite, that Queen
of Packets, the Steamer Bart Able,
arrived at our wharf on Tuesday
evening last. Cap-. Dick Sinnott
Slooked as. pleasing as ever, and his
Shost of friends were more than hap
a py to meet him. That genial gen
tieman, Capt. Geo. Hiamilton was
greeted by all; for all are ,his friends,
in the nmoest cordial manner. Ship
pers should bear in mind 'that Capt.
Siunott's line is a fixture, taking
freight at the lowest rates, both dir
ring high and low water. The travel
ling publle will consult their comfort
Sby patrionizingthe HBart Able, where
Severything will be done to meet their
wants.: Mr. Jules E. Messi, is the
Sagent of the line.
' We would be pleased to know
l how the members attending the
I call session are to ibe paid. The
, amount appropriated to cover the
expenses of 111 members in the
r lHouse and 36 members of the
a ~enate, has long since been ex
k hausted.
: The N . O ep bliahla rebukes
x the citizens of Alabama for not
attending the speaking of Pinch
back, at MIobile, the other day. If
Sthe white people of any State in
the Union have not heard enough
of Pinchback ere this, we think
f tlhejy must be deaf to all sOund.
SThe fellow has bore~d Louisiana to
, death within the past six years,
a and we are glad to know that he
a has fitted his "auger" in some

POLITICAL CIIIS IMMINENT.
New Orleans, April 19.-Mnch dis
cussion and excitement produced in
political circles to-day by report
which if proves true that conserva
tire caucus had resolved to seat in
the House, Charles l)elhommer and
Felix Voorhies, of St. Martin, O. L.
Collins, of St. lelena and G. B.
Burkhart, of 7th Ward, of New Or
leans, all democrats, and who were
declared elected by the returning
board, in place of Martin Cocheran,
Floyd and Richard, republicans, who
were seated in the Hahn House, af
ter the withdrawal of Speaker Wilts
and his followers, in January. The
conservatives contend that all con
servatives returned by the returning
I board, were under the award, to be
seated, while the republicans contend
that these four men were not to be
disturbed. Marshal Packard stated
to-day that if the four republicans
were ousted he had instructed his
men in the Senate to adjourn for
three days, and if at the end of that
time they were not reseated, the
Senate will adjourn sine die. The
seating of Delhommer, Voorhies,
Collins and Burckhart in the House
will give a conservative majority on
joint ballot. Colonel Packard says
i the republicans did not and would not
agree to any arrangement which
would deprive them of a muajoity on
joint ballot. Another political crisis
imminent. There ,seems to be no
doubt about the seating of these mem
bers to-morrow or Wednesday.
Upon Tusday last, 20th inst., our
city and vicinity was visited with a
most terrific hail storm, accompanied
with wind and rain. The duration
of the hail storm was about half an
hour and it fell at a heavy rate, cut
ting foliage and limbs from trees,
breaking window glasses andserious
ly, if not fatally, injuring the fruit
crop. We see many peach and ap
ple trees almost'stripped of fruit! and
we fear damage to a great extent has
been done the growing corn in the
country. Some of the hail stones
picked up in the streets measured as
much as four and a half inches in cir
cumference.
The country cotemporaries of the
' great light, the N. O. Republican,
anxiously await the time when it will
sound a "bllast upon its bugle horn,"
in relation to the compromise. Up
to this*writing the country press of
the Radical faction have remained in
a state of masterly inactivity on that
question. Come, "head centre," give
your small fry an opening and let
them know what cane be done in re
lation to the adjustment.
We close with this week's issue,
the publication of the testimony of
s the Radical witnesses before the Con
gressional Committee.
5 E. L. Pierson, however, retracted
that part in his testialony relative to
Sthe hiring of persous to assassinate
himn by Col. Wm. M. Levy, although
- te statement at first was too palpa
Sble to be credited.
, The entire testimony speaks for
Sitself, and can be preserved as a
rmatter of record how men can false
'ly testify for party purposes.
We hear it mooted that a Grange
will shortly be established in this
city. This is as it should be, for we
are farbehind in this matter. Granges
Shave been established at nearly every
tpoint desirable in the parish save
Supon the river. Farmers will do well
to consult together in this matter and
it will befound conductive to their
Sinterest to establish and keep up
these associations all over the South.
- Our mails are getting in a condition
Sto call forth maledictions both loud
- and deep. We were kept from our
- regular Shreveport Times three days
t during the last week; and to a peo
Sple upon the "ragged-edge" of ex
r peetancy for yte news, this is getting
to be monotonous. Cannot something
be done to put through thie mail mat
teri The carriers come bit bring no
!papers.
Meslrs ..G4rsia & Raggio, from the
people's favdrite family grocery store,
on second street, are prepared to
Sfurnish fish of the most delicious
!quality and fresh from their native
• element, each Friday. Put in youear
orders and be served.
Our old frieid, Mr. Joseph Levy,
has opened a retail family grocery
store,. corner Horn and Front streets,
where be will lie pliised to attend
the wants of his"~pmerous friends.
We receive th9 PUblic, a month
ly, published at Washington city in
the interest of the Bepublican party,
which is brim fall of ably written
artieles to show that the southern
people are all rebels and traitors and
deserve nothing less than banging.
We would bet there was not a "ilendn
in the concern near enough a "rebel
line" during the war to tell the color
of their uniform.

What means the non-veto of the
bill amending our city charter ? Gov.
Kellogg, unless he appoints tire per
Ssons chosen by the people, will have
a hard time installing his pets here.

SCol. McClure, of the Philadelphia
Times, goes for his friend Blaine as
- follows:
Blaine was in at the death in Con
r, necticut. He seemed te have a tidle
a of blunders upon hiam just now. He
a blundered in either not defiantly as
" sailing the Administration when he
assailed its measures, or in not ac
cepting its policy and championing
ge its policy and championing its ':h
is ors. He blundered when he ahioweid
Ir his head to be bared to Admiuistra
tion blows by becoming the center of
Sa presidential movement in dubious
'- circles in Philhuelphia, and he blun
re dered when, after having been hound
1 ed by the President's organ, he yield.
ed a half-way obedience to the ar
rogance of power by repeating old
ir time seetienal speeches in Counecti
p cut.
b. He should have gone there to go
through with the party-Force bill,
third term and all-or he should have
an staid at Ihome, for in the wreck that
id foilowed bis campaining there he is
r i blamed by both aides for having been
a neither cold nor hot. If Blaine were
running any one else for the Presi
Sdential candidate can afford to be
- silentmost times, and can afford to
g speak sometimes, but can never af
g ford to speak and mean nothing; and
when, for fanst of something sensible
to say, he declared that be desired
o the Republican purty to fight its own
battles on the issue of eternal see
tional hate-"to stand," as be say,
"e "i 76 and '80 and '84, and in many
other campaigns where oar brothers
stood from '61 to '65." lie fairly gets
Sdown to the political level of average
a carpet-bagger legislative candidates
e in the South, and of men of aider
Smanic and constabulary ambition in

have it sabon, or a onee most promis
