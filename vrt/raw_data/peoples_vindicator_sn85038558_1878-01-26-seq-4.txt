IDESSING UNDER DIFFICULTIES. X
Scanty Toilets of Confederate Belles--
The Cost of Fancy Goods.
Mrs. M. F. t1andv in Phila. Weekly Times. 1o
Daring General Sheridanl's last raid a
General Custer and his staff slplped
over night at the honse of a phlanter in th
Fluvanna County. Viiginia. lianugh - h
tily, yet courtel usly, after the fashion li, i
of well-bred peopI wiho can not heelp at
themselves, the lest in the hoese was e
placed at their dispousal. Among tl e a
Arst of Cestcr's requirements was i
bath, and tubs aend water, with honme
made towels, were readily folthconm
log. Not so, however, were sponges
and Turkish towels. At this the t.
General showed some anger, stppos- J -
sing the neglect intenti onal. Whenc
his servant was assured by the lady
of the houise that her stock ief yseMht
articles was exhausted anid could not
be replenished % ithin the Confede- 4
rate lines, miaster and lman were in
tensely disgusted, and Custer.express- ,i
ed his astonishment that civilized ,
people could exist without them. f,
Sponges were not to he had at any 4
price in Richmond during the war of ,
1564 5, the few inmported to Charles ,
toun ad \\'iluingtoin being kept for
hospital use. The ladies knit bath- e
ing gloves of course cotton yarn in c
garter-stitch, making a close ribbed c'
surface with gave tihe desired fiiction.
The cargoes brought by the blockade
runners consisted chiefly of munli- t1
tions of war, medicines and staple .,
dry goods. Only occasionally a pack
age of fancy goods was included, and
these were soon exhansted- -the de
mind far exeeeding the supply. hair
pine, needles, pins, scissors, conmbhs,
&c., brought fancy prices. In Janu
ary, 1865, a common guttapercha c
tuck-comb bought to order in Wil
mington, N. C., cost $50-equal to
$1 25 in giold-at which price the
purchaser was glad to obtain it, Rich
mond and Charleston having been
previously ransacked in vain in search
for one. A great deal of smuggling
was carried on across the border,
principally by women, and the stores
bought by the sutlers in the Federal
army were solme small compensation
to even the most rebellious women for
the presence of the army under
whose shadow they came. .Quilted
petticoats were the fashion then, as
now, and many of them were made
to order for smuggling purposes. In
one the filling was skeins of tewing
silk, in another papers of quinine,
and on with every thing which could
be crowded into small compass. La
dies who came through the lines un
der flag-of-truce were rigorously
searched; nevertheless, a great deal
that was contraband of war came
through with them. A school girl
acquaintance of the writer displayed
much ingenuity on such an occasion.
"I brought my waterfall cushion full
of morphine to Dr. --," she said
"The morphine was in tissue paper;
over that I laid dark cotton batting,
and over that curled hair in an inviri
ble net. They made mue take my
hair down and shake it out. Miss
Kerr carried dispatches to Beaure
gard in hers, you know. I tell you,
though, I was seared when the wo
man who searched me ran a hair-pin
through the cushion. I had dispatch
es, too, on thin paper, folded and
sewed into a pocket pin-cushion, buit,
as they were wsitten with invisible
ink and I had taken care to soil the
cushion, I didn't feel frightened
about them. It was a risk, though,
for if they had found them I should
have been sent to the Old Capitol
Prison."

Ages of United States Senators.

I have taken considerable pains to I
collect and compile the ages of Sen- t
ators. One familiar with their faces
and figures will be very much sur
prised with tihe result, as some of the
oldest-looking men are the youngest
in years, and some of the most aged
show less than their younger collea

appropriately for the Wandering Jew.
Ferry, who sits behind him, and is
one year older, looks young enough
to be his son ; so does Booth, who is
two years older.
Dorsey is the youngest man who
ever sat in the Senate; hle has been
there nearly fire years, and easne in
at the age of thirty ; as young as is
allowed by the constitution.

Donald, Anthony, Burnside and Cam

Cattle in Winter.
As the years run, farmn work will
not press this m0onth, and yet, if the
weather shlionl chance to be mild
iatld ,l)wn, Ihe re will be no need of
any 1oss of time for want of some
thing to do. The chores about the (
bIarn, in tihe woodshedi and the tool
house will occupy a large share of F
attentio n, and they c(anlnot hle nieglect- i
eid. Thie liiv st k of every kinlld is
entiiely depenldeit upon us at this
seasin, and the thrift and profit of 11
(cows, horses, sheep, pigs and pioultry,
S.ill lits or tall in propoirtion to the
care which they teceive. some foill:s
think, or seerm t tthicik, that if they
give cattlet enough to eat in toil
weatller, it is all the cain do. But
IS 11iIan does not live by bread alone,
the cattle that inilisteri to his coimi
fort and supply his wants, do not
Ihrive by hay alone. IIuly may keep
them alive, but to secure thrift we
must study their comfort ill eveiy
way, antid this requires us to look out
for cleanlitness, good air, good water
anid enlough of it, witlhout exposing
time to the extremel cold of stormy
weiather. We think the card and the
cuit'y comb ought to have exercise
every day, and they aglee with a
cow's back uncommoilnly well. A
change of variety of food, also,
seems to be, desirable, though thllee
Iliy Ie some ditference of opinionu on
- this ioilit. We prefer to have a few
Ciroots to feed, or pumpkins, and if
we hadn't tlhese we should waniit to
i give a simall allowance of meal or
shorts in addition to the regular ra
tions of hay.
The obl style of wintering cattle
in very many, if not nIiost of our
Scoluntry towns, was not calculated to
brinig cattle out very well in the
Ssprling. They went into the winter
e usually on notling but swale hay
' and often not a very liberial supply of
" that. Farmers had a large lmow or
I two of coarse bog hay that tlhey
thought miust be eaitte up, anld they
r, resoued that it was best to get rid If
it first, in the early part of the winter,
l and they fed lout this coailse hay, the
I poorest they had, in December and
' J;anuary, so as to lelive the best, or
Englisli ihay, till spring, and they
d, usually continued to feed ithe young
15 stock with it all through the winter.
te If they got cattle through alive they
n were apt to think themselves lucky.
ig In a large majority of cases their
e, stock was poor, and Dot unfrequentllly
i they were nothing but skin and
- bones. There has been vast improve
in aent in the wintering of stock in the
I1 last quarter of a century, aud, though
al there are cases of neglect and bad
Smaiiagement now, here and there, we
Sunderstand the priiciples of feeding
d lbetter than our fathers lanld grand
e* fathers did, alnd cattle, as a general
dil rule, are far better winteled than they
dused to be. They are less exposed to
r; cold storms than they used to be.
"' They are not purposely left out to
. "tOlgheln," ais they used to be, and
ii so they cole oiut in the spring in
as better condition.-IPlowtiall.

Consomme--Rich broth, clarified,
becomes consomme. It is the best
and most nutritious food that can be a
given to old people, because it is
easily digested, and does not require
any mastication: it is, in fact, to old
people what milk is to the infant.
Consomme is best in a liquid state,
having the same nutritive properties.
After having strained the broth, put
it back in the kettle with (foi two
quarts of broth) two onions and two
carrots in slices, two raw eggs, a few
ounces of chopped, lean beef; beat
the whole well together, set on the
fire, and boil gently until clear. The
process will take about half an hour ;
then strain, arnd it is ready. If it is
wanted very nutritious, use more
chopped meat.
A Nice Way to Cook Venison.
Cut it up into pieces and stew tender,
taking care that it stews dry. Whlion
done season with pepper and salt,
I add some butter or fat and let it fry
and brown in the kettle, turning the
pieces occasionally; take out the
meat, pour in water, thicken and
season for gravy.
To Cure IHams.-Let them be thor
oughly rubbed with salt ; be sure that
every part is completely covered,
pack them on a table or inl a barrel,
and let them remain one week ; then
brush off the salt, smoke, and they
are ready for use. Hams cured in
this way are much more tender and
sweeter than when placed in strong
brine and allowed to remain for
w.eeks, then soaked for several days
in cold water before smoking.
Frosted Lemon Pie.-Take the
yelks of 3 eggs, 1 cup of sugar, the
grated rind and juice of 1 lemon, 2
spoonfuls of corn-starch, a small
piece of butter and 1 cup of sweet
milk; bake; then on the top spread
the whites of 3 eggs beaten to a stiff
froth, with 3 spoonfuls of sugar; put
it back in the oven and brown 1 min
ute.
Aunt Nancy's Corn Cake.-Two
enps of sweet milk, and one of sour;
three cups of meal, and one of flour;
one-half cup of molasses; one tea
spoonful of soda, and one of salt, and
steam two and one-half hours.
To Remove Ink Stains.-Ink stains
in cotton or linen goods can be re
moved by washing in salt and water.
This should be done previous to
washing the fabric with soap.
Potato Pie.-Boil common or sweet
potatoes till well done, then mash of
strain. To each 1I pints add l pints
of tuilk, a little melted butter, 2 eggs
with sugar, salt, and nutmeg or lenm
on to flavor.
Pennsylvania Flannel Cakes. - -
quart of milk, I teaspoonful of salt, 3
eggs, the whites beaten separately to
a stiff froth. Mix milk, salt and yelks,
then stir in the flour till a batter is
made suitable for griddle-eakes, then,
when ready to bake, stir in the whites.
-A Nice Way to Cook Venison.
Cut it up into pieces and stew ten
der, taking care that it stews dry.
SWhen done season with pepper and
salt, add some butter or fat and let it
fry and brown in the kettle, turning
the pieces occasionally; take out the
r meat, poor in water, thicken and
season for gravy.
