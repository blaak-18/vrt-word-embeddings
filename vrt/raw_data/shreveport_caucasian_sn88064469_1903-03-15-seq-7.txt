It i true this power was vested in the
Governor to safeguard the people at a
tinte when the State was in peril, hut
there is now no danger since the people
who have the right to govern are in full
r possession of the State. Under the pres
ent system of appointment the people
are not only relieved of the authority of
electing officers to positions appointive,
but in a vacancy such as sheriff, for in
stance, the wishes of the people may be
nullified altogether, as was practically
demonstrated in Lincoln parish recently
where there was a vacancy resulting
from the death of the sheriff of that par
ish. In such case, under the law, the
coroner of the parish assumes charge
until the vacancy is filled. When this
vacancy occurred the citizens of Lin
coln expressed a desire to have such
vacancy filled by one who would repre
sent the majority of the Democrats of
the pitrtsh, and naturally requested the
Democratic parish committee to order a
primary election, at which the Demo
crats would be given an opportunity of
declaring their choice. It was under
stood and agreed to that the man receiv
ing such majority should be the sheriff.
Accordingly the Democratic parish com
mittee fixed a date for such primary,
which provoked the ire of Governor
Heard to a degree which surprised his
friends. The Governor immediately and
unceremoniously squelched the commit
tee who had advised him and desired a
delay in the appointment until-the people
could speak. Not only were the people
willing but the several candidates read
ily acquiesced in a proposition which
was fair and Democratic. It is unneces
sary to quote what Governor Heard said
except that he declared that the people
had no authority and that he had al
ready apiointed the man, Mr. Mayfield,
and-he intimated' that no other need ap
ply. There could be no objection urged
against Mr. Mayfield, a geatlenian es
teeme4 tor ais persotn wo ith, an4 who
had been the dead sheriffs chief deputy,
and it is not this appointement as the
would-be rebuke of Governor Heard to
the' Democrats of, Lincoln parish for
their assumption of -a hority which is
vested in home ahone, which should be
egikasized. "
It is true a primary would have re
h qfred, a delay in compliance with for
malities and technicalities, and in "a close
malities aid technicalities, . ald in a
close constradion ' of the law th4
acting sheriff "cald not have col,
!acted the rtms due and also tha
such delay woeld have perhaps incon
vepienced people who desired to liqui
date' their debts to theoparish and State
bemt the Democrats of Lincoln committed
no act to which Governor Heard should
have taken offerse. The power which ii
exercised by the Governor is supposea
to be from the people, who are some
tnnes flattered as sovereigns ,and are
sovereigns whey they determwine to be.
It is clear to our mind that the apologies
anw egplanations in favor of the Gov
tenor can add little to his credit, and he
Lm. forced himself in a position which is
not in harmony with his declarations
and enunciation, of all tights being
vewed. i the people. But our purpose is
not so much a -cti icsm of the Governor
for Aercising a prerogative given him
by law as it is to call the people's atten
sion to and to emphasize the necessity of
rtfievig the Goiurnor of imuk if not
all the appointive power he insesses,
and wilt this had other issues before
which the claim. of individuals are
minim sd. The one mian power is no
loqer .a ecessity. The people am the
power mnd the power must be reirned
to the -pie. If not, why not?

A Ghont Tent.
When you think you see a ghost,
how can you tell whether it really is
a ghost or not? A recent writer gives
the following scientific method: "We
assume that n person sees an appari
tion. It may be objective-i. e., having
existence outside the observer's mind
or merely a creature of a disordered
brain, subjective. The seer, while look
ing at the vision with both his eyes.
gently depresses one eyeball wit u his
forefinger from outside the top eyelid,
so causing a squint. If objective,
whether bogus or not, two ontlines of
the 'ghost' will be seen, but one, of
course, if it be subjective. One may
prove this by trial any time with any
object, near or far. I mnntion this be
cause of the many nervous and brain
wearied people who see spooks and to
whom it would be better that they
should know that the trouble is with
in themselves and so seek a capable
doctor than eontinue to be haunted, as
they believe, by the supernatural."
The Rocking of Lake Erie.
The 250 mile trough of Lake Erie lies
approximately in the direction of the
west to southwest winds which prevail
in that part of the country. Thus the
lake offers an excellent opportunity for
studying the effects of the wind upon
a large body of inclosed water, and
very interesting these effects some
times prove. Rhythmic gusts produce
a rocking motion and great blows from
the west or southwest sweep the liquid
body of the lake eastward and some
times cause a rise of eight feet or more
at Buffalo in the course of a few hours.
As soon as the maximum force of the
gale has passed the water swings back.
Continued rockings nvs observed on
days when the strength of the wind
fluctuates.-Youth's Companion.
Fabric of Daily Life.
It is not of lofty or heroic deeds that
the enduring pattern of character is
woven, but rather of the seemingly
small things of life. Little unheralded
acts of helpfulness, slight self denials
that bar against selfishness, conscien
tious attention to trifling details of du
ty, standing firm to the right in spite
of banter and contempt (really the most
difficult thing for young or old to with
stand), adherence to scrupulous hones
ty In word and deed even in what oth
ers consider of no import, sticking to
principle though one may be called
"old fashioned," "unprogressive" or
"puritanical" - these are the golden
strands which, woven into the fabric
of daily living, make men and women
invincible.-Success.
Mistake In the Locality.
That keen rivalry which western
towns feel Is probably responsible for
the story about Seattle. which may well
have been said of some other place at
some other time. It concerns a Seattle
man who died and went to the here
after.
"I don't see." he remarked, after a.
casual survey of his new quarters.
"that heaven is so much better than
Seattle." -
"But this isn't heaven," explained a
bystander.-New York Tribune.
How the Ameients Regarded Iron,
The ancient Egyptians believed that
Iron was the bone of Typhon, the ene
any of Osiris, and for this reason it was
conskldered impure. No one could make
me of It even for the most ordinary
requirements of life without polluting
his soul in a way that would cause
him harm both on earth and in the
other\world.
Resadig.
Were I to pray for a taste which
should stand me in stead under every
variety of circumstance and be a source
of happiness and cheerfulness to me
dIuring life and a shield against ills,
however things might go amiss and
the world frown upon me. It would be
a taste for reading.-Sir John Herschel.

"Have you ever written anything,"

world happier or better?"
"Rather," quoth the insurance agent
