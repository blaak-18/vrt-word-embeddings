CONCERNING PUNCTUALITY.

People Who Are "T'oo Previous."

housemaids and their own discomfort,
who greet their host and hostess with
a re'ironchfull "\1'e have been down
sOen time! '
Thou there is the fussy host, who
speeds his partite guests half an hour
too soon to catch a train, thus Inflict
ing on his victims a long wait at a dull,
drafty station till they are bored and
tired before they commence their jour
ney.
Life is too short to spend so nuoch of
it in unnecessary waiting as is done by
these "too previous" spirits tand the
unfortunates they drag in their train.
Punctuality does not consIst In always
being too soon for everything, as those
householders seem to think who keep
their docks habitually ten minutes too
fast. The happy knack of real punctu
ality, Is a royal gift, the outcome of
forethought and kindly consideration
for the feelings of those with whom we
have to do.
As it has often boen remarked that it
Is nevei safe to count upon our deaf
Biends being always dull of hearing, in
the saIne way it is not wise on all oc
etsions to reckon even on the most con

New silky velvetciis enrry the day.
Mingled with smooth or shaggy cloths
or without any such additions such
suits promise no emil of smartness.
This new velveteen is so pliable that
the skirts plait admirably. All silk
velvets have their appoimted full dress
elegance, and emnpiuemements of fur and
passementerie orunna leis will combine
to make their smanrtest trimming ef
fects, together with Chenille and silk
short fringes and passcnmenterie drops.
Besides all this variety are the lovely
laces In black and white, in cream and
pearl tones, which are used for velvet
coats.
As an example of velveteen and
cloth is a lovely myrtle green two
piece suit.. A broad squirrel stole and
huge muff, both lined with white satin,
insure the extremely modish air of this
suit.
