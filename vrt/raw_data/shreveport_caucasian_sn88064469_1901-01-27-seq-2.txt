dial a nature that many Surrey folk
are thinking of going there and starting
In the newspaper business themselves.
Mr. Har.-isworth's home here in Sur
rey is known as Sutton Place. The
manor and estate was purchased by
him recently, and it eclipses almost all
others in the British isles in size and
historic r0b-rest. It Is situated (our
miles from '7uilford and an equal his
tance from Wl(oking. It is also with
in easy readi uf London.
Sutton Place is one of the otlest
existing noncastellated residence- in
England. It was one of the first man
or houses built after the feudal age.
when the ioesd of dlefi use seemed to
have passed away. The estate was
given by Henry VIII to Sir Henry
Weston. one of his privy councilcrs.
who began the construction of the
house in 1323. An extraordinary fact
is that from the time of Ilehry VIII
,nntil it recently passed into Mr.
Hlarmnsworth's possession It had re
juainsd continuously in the same fani
ily. Another reumarkable fact Is that,
although the Westons were devout
t'atholies and royalists. their house.
within a half hisur's walk of a stout
Puritan towtn and likewise close to
Winchester and Rasinghouse. has not
an escutcheon defaced or a window
broken after all the religious and po
Iltical revolutions through whiell it has
passed.
Mr. Harmsworth attributes much of
his success in the various ventures he
kas been connected with to the splen
did business qualities of his brother
Harold. who will shortly visit the Unit
ed States, and to the work and sug
gestions of his wife. Harold Harms
worth is some three years younger
than his brother. It was lie who made
the deal in paper prior to the Boer
war by which the Harmsworth family
netted an enormous sum. In addition
there are Cecil Harmsworth, Leicester
Harmsworth, now member of parlia
ment for Caithness, Hildebrand
Harmsworth and St. John Ilarnms
worth, a remarkable and dkevoted band
of brothers, who are all taking an
active part in the management of the
thirty odd papers and magazines un
der the control of the family.

In its well bred softness and the beauty
of its fluctuations. She has helped
In the smallest as well as the largest
ot her husband's undertakings and has
ubdeared herself to the Surrey folk by
tier unaffectedness and her hospitality.
Mr. Harmsworth's rise to the ranks
of the multlimillionaires has been term
ed ibeteoric by those associated with
hlim io his different enterprises. Twelve
yeirs ago he had not a penny other
pan his unateady earnings at story
writing. In May, 1888, he conceived
the Idea of starting the periodical
known then as "Answers to Corre
spondents." Of the first number only
. 1.300 cpies were sold. The proprie
tor then concluded that the name was
too long; and cut it down to Answers.
Then the paper commenced to move
ahead slowly lut surely and in the lat
ter part of 11'P hadl a weekly circula
tion of 4 AKKI.
The greatest hit of all was yet to
cone. In Tanui:ry. I1 Mr. IIarmc
worth aunounci d that Answers would
rive ono pound a week for life to the
person guesting nearest to the amount
of money in the Rank of England at
a stated tiie. Each comipY.titor 'as
obliged to attach to his guets the name
and address of five friends. In this
manner the paper was brought to the
attention of Ib tween ti-e :s ~ four
million rseo'l . ihany of wi hiii sot .
became sul scrihers. The success of
Answers as a money ma:ring concern
was now established, and it supplied
the capital enabling Mr. lHarmsworth
to become a control lug factor in the

blouses or shirt waists. And I have
seen tons on tots of shirt waists with
in the last two weeks. Why woun!
the manufacturers go to such trouble
and expense if postilion lastlues were
to take the place of all other things?
I dare say there will be Sette of thiel
intended for strictly tailor suits, but
the very shape of the corsets shows
that the loose front is the one thing
now to be considered. The same con
tortion of the body to push the front
forward and to make the hips prom
inent is fashionable, and until that
ridiculous fad is over \ve need not
fear tight basques, for they would
not "go" with the present shape of the
female form divine.
Besides, there are the belts, and
never did I see so ainny kinds and
sizes and inventions. That is a word
proper to use, for some of them are
really quite as complicated as ma
-"hinery. They are like harness, and
they have pulleys. and it is easier to
say what is not than what is. But the
very fact that there is such a move
ment in furnishing new styles of belts
and ceintures goes to show that
Basques are as yet in the minority.
The wide draped belt is covered with
silk, satin, velvet or. as it is in some
NEW BELTS AND GIRDLES.
cases. just with gold braid laid on the
foundation. one line above the other.
This style is for young ladies or very
dressy matrons. The general utility
belt is made of leather, and there are
many shapes for them. The most are
straight and of the same width all
around, but others again have the
back much wider than the front. All
have harness buckles. Some of these
buckles are so heavy and ordinary
looking that if they were not so stylish
they would not be tolerated for a mo
ment.
Novelties show a straight front and
the back to be cut and stitc:'ed in vari
ous forms, the illustration showing two
of the most curious of them. These are
made of seal, alligator, morocco. patent
leather and several other kinds of
leather. They are cut so that the
strain comes on the center of the belt,
and so it does not curl up.
The made belts and girdles are rath
er more dressy, and, as It is quite
possible for a woman to make these
for herself and so that each one may
match a dress, I shall tell how they
are made. A silk model is shown
here, and this is cut it three pieces,
the front one being double breasted
(to use the word signifying a garment
which is fastened to one sides. One
row of gilt buttons is set on one side
and buttonholes on the other. The
center is fastened to the underside of
the belt by small buttons, and there
is a row of the large ones to which
the others button. The shape can be
easily understood and is sloped to fit
the figure. To get the shape one could
cut one out of a stiff paper anti try It

're cut from stiff btuckranm and itoned (In
