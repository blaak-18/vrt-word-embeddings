V1NECAR BITTERS
Grateful Thonsands proclaim
V inegar B itters the most wonder
ful Invigorant tbat ever sustained
the sinking system.
No Person can take these Bit
ters according to directions, and re
main long unwell, provided their
bones are not destroyed by mineral
poison or other means, and vital or
gans wasted beyond repair.
Bilious, Remittent, and In
termittent Fevers, which are so
nrcvalont in the valleys of our great
rivers throughout the United States,
especially those of the Mississippi,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee,
Cumberland, Arkansas, Red, Colo
rado, Brazos, Rio Grande, Pearl,
Alabama, Mobile, Savanuah, Ro
anoke, James, and many others,
with their vast tributaries, through
out our entire country during the
Summer and Autumn, and remarka
bly so during seasons of unusual
heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, aud
other abdominal viscera. In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to D r . J. W alker's V inegar
H itters , as they will speedily remove
the dark-colored viscid matter with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
stimulating the secretions of the lirer,
and generally restoring the healthy func
tions of the digestive organs. t
Fortify the body agaiiist dis
ease by purifying all its fluids with
V ikkoar B ittkrs . No epidemic can
take bold of a system thus fore-armed.
Dyspepsia or Indigestion, Head
ache, Pain in the Shoulders, Coughs,
Tightness of the Chest, Dizziness, sour
Eructations of the Stomach, Bad Taste
in the Moutb, Bilious Attacks, Palpita
tion of the Hoart, Inflammation of the
Lungs, Pain in the region of theKidceys,
and a hundred other painful symptoms,
are tho offsprings of Dyspepsia. One bot
tle will prove a better guarantee of its
merits than a lengthy advertisement.
Scrotal», or Kin
Swellings,
Neck, Goil
Indolent Inflammations, Mercurial affec
tions, Old Sores, Eruptions of tho Skin,
Sore Eyes, etc. In these, as in all other
constitutional Diseases, W alkkr's VlK
roa r B ittkrs have shown their great cur
ativo powers in the most obstinate and
intrnctablo cases.
For Inflammatory and Chronic
Rheumatism, Gout, Bilious, Remit
tent and Intermittent Fevers, Diseases
of the Blood, Liver, Kidneys and Bladder,
tbeso Bitters havo no equal. Such Dis
eases are caused by Vitiated Blood.
Mechanical Diseases.— Persons
engaged in Paints and Minerals, such as
Plumbers, Type-setters, Gold-beaters and
Miners, as they advance in life, are sub
ject to paralysis of the Bowels. To guard
against this, take a dose of W alker's
V inegar B itters occasionally.
For Skin Diseases, Eruptions,
Totter, Sal t- Khcu m, Blotches, Spots, Pim
ples, Pustules, Boils, Carbuncles, King
worms, Scald-head, Sore Eyes, Erysipe
las, Itch, Scurfs, Discolorations of the
Skin, Humors and Diseases of tho Skin of
whatever name or nature, are literally
dug up and carried out of the system in a
short time by the use of these Bitters.
» Tin, Tape, and other Worms,
lurking in the system of so many thou
sands, are effectually destroyed and re
moved. No system of medicine, no ver
mifuges, no anthelmintics will freo the
system from worms like these Bitters.
ForFcnialeComplaints, in young
or old, married or single, at the dawn of
woinauhood, or the turn of life, these Ton
ic Bitters display so decided an influence
that improvement is soon perceptible.*
Cleanse the Vitiated Blood
whenever you find its impifrities bursting
through the skin in Pimples, Eruptions,
or Sores; cleanse it when yon find it ob
structed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse
it when it is Joui ; your feelings will tell
p the "
it tbo sys
Q R. H. HeDONALO A CO.,
you when. Keep the blood pure, and the
health of tho system will follow.

For two years past, tbe UNIVERSITY,

still it survives ; and with the dawn of

of its patient endurance, under long snffer
