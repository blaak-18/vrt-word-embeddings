day that the bridge over Mine's

Money being very scarce just now
it takes special inducements to make
people part with some of their
wealth. L. Levy & Son offer the
special inducements at their store

very lowest possible price. Read
what they have to say in another
part of this paper.
Protracted meetings have been
held at the Methodist church since
Saturday and will continue till to
day noon. The "cowboy" preach
er, Rev. Mr. Montgomery has stirred
up the sinners very effectively and
many accessions to the church has
been the result. Mr. Montgomery
is a strong, lucid, and effective
speaker and his whole soul is in his
work. The resident pastor was
much pleased to see the large num
ber of people attending the meet
ings-in fact the number was so
large that Thursday evening many
could not secure entrance inside the
church.
G. R. Wilson, of Houston, Texas,
representing the old firm of P. C.
T''omson & Co., Philadelphia, Penn.,
has been in our city selling the fa
mous Hoc Cake Soap. A laundry
soap that softens hard water, and
washes the clothes whiter, cleaner
and in one-third the time required
when using yellow soaps. It is said
to please every one. Give Hoe
Cake a' trial and you will use no
other laundry soap. Call on your
grocer for it. The merchants we
understand will have it on sale in
twenty days.
A Singular Accident
Last Saturday night, at about zo
o'clock, in the neighborhood of
Ridge, a serious and singular acci
dent halppened to two young men.
It seems that four young men were
riding together when D. Hoffpauir
suggested that he take one of the
young men home with him for the
night, and H. Hoffpauir take the
other. This was agreed to, and.
they then separated. After going
some distance on their several ways
they decided, co-incidently, to turn
back, and gave their horses free
rein. WVhen near a copse, and
owing to the shadow, they did not
see each other, and coming at full
tilt D. and H. Hoffpauir ran into
one another, and from the collision
each had a leg fractured. It ap
pears that the young men have a
habit of racing their horses, and
these young men were but indulging
in a usual pastime when the unfor
tutiate accident occurred. Dr.
Yottng, of Rayne, due to the inabil
ty of Drs. Clark and Lyons, of that
locality to respond, was sent for
and attended to the needs of the
young men, who, late reports aver,
are doing fairly well, and, luckily,
amputation will not be necessary
It looks as if our friend of The Gazette
is rather doubtful of our railroad to Lafa
yette. Is Iberia going to be the winner?
Don't give up the ship so soon Charley;
keep your ground.-Valley of the Teche,
Breaux Bridge.
Friend, due to the crew congre
gating together on the forecastle the
old ship (railroad) has taken a lurch,
and is sinking. We have simply
jumped in the life-boat (refinery)
and hope to reach the shore of
Prosperity. At least our chances are
far better than remaining
striding the gunwales of the old
ship which will soon take a plunge
down to the bottom of the deep sea
of oblivion. That's all.
Advertising in Bad Times.
There is one kind of enterprise
which pgys even better in such times
as theseithan in good' times. This
is enterprise in advertising. Skilful
and persistent.advertising is useful
and profitable at any time; but now
adays the man who keeps the bar
gains he offers most conspicuously
before the people especially profits
by it. In these days people are
looking with uncommon sharpness
for bargains. They iont to spend
their money to the best advantage,
and notwithstanding the cry of hard
times, there is some money, and
more soon coming, to spend. The
merchants who do the most and the
best advertising will get the most of
it and will have business to do,
while those whe seek to save money
by refraining to let the people know
what they've to offer to them, will
likely find that the buying public
will not hunt them up to ascertain if
they have got any bargains.
