The most delightful vacation home is
- log cabin. There are log eabins and
log cabins, of course, from the pailace
like establishment of the Adlirondlack
millionaire, which resemubles a eabiin
only on the outside, to the hImible
shaback of the hunt-r. All. however. are
equally fascinating if they are fur
lDished In the right way so that the
rustic "woody" effect is not lost. Nit a
single piece of wood should be painted
either within or wit hout the cabin.
The most effective furniture Is on the
bent woodl order, and ranch of It can Ie
made from the young forest trees. The
trees themselves stripped of their foli
age andl with their branches cut down
into little knobs make very effective
pillars for the rustic veranda, and they

represents the interior of the living

This room is long and low, with a
heavily beamed ceiling. There is no
attempt made to cover the walls, and
as the logs are smooth and beautifully
oiled they add to the effect. The floor
Is of hard wood, brightly polished. The
furniture in this case is of pine,. stained

ISystematic Plans to Destroy a South
western Peat.
[Special Correspoudence.]
SA5 ANTONo. T'ix.. Aug. 13.-South
cn Texa, is being overrun by grass
I lFoppers-gras- ipprs of an extremely
Vorai:olls il:ractor andl numerous
enough to havs. hI-re ne a menace of
the gravest nature to the crops of that
portion of tihe slate. In fact. rnmay
farmier. are :n lbstair. 'riTey see the
grain wither ant fail as thouogh blight
ed. while tihe merry grasshopper. hay
Ing eaten all there is to eat. passes on
to fresh fields and pastures new.
Not only in Texas. but In norther-n
states, notably Colorado. Wyoalinug and
Nebraska. has th!. grasshopper provel
a plague to the farimer. Now the agri
culturist finds some grains of comfort
in the fact that the federal governinent
has ldeclared wa-or on thie pest, and that
means are at hand whereby the insect
can be successfully combaited.
To the farmers of southern Texas
have come bottles of disease germs.
fatal to the grasshopper. prepared
under the direction of Professor L. O.
Howard. chief of the bureau of en
tomology. The disease germs are of
the nature of a fungus. obtained from
South Africa, where it has been used
with the greatest possible success.
whole armies of grasshoppers being
literally exterminated by it Were it
necessary to send continually to South
Africa for the fungus, it would prove
a costly remedy. but it has been found
possible to propagate it artificially by
applying a little of it to a sterilized
prepamtion of blood serum and gela
tin, on which the germs propagate
rapidly. The germs thus prepared are
corked in glass tubes. and each tube is
carefully packed In a pasteboard cylin
der, directions for using the contents
accompanying every package.
On receiving a bottle of the fungus
the farmer puts a number of live grass
hoppers In a wooden box, together with
a small portion of the fungus. Soon
the hoppers become infected, and all
but half a dozen are liberated. The
half dozen, when dead. serve to give
the disease to other hoppers placed in
the box later on. The liberated ones
quickly spread the infection among
their fellows, and the work of destruc
tion proceeds apace. To get the best
results the "plague house" should be
covered with netting to admit air.
One thing Is certain-the farmer
alone cannot successfully cope with the
hoppers. The insect is one of the most
srrlons problems connected with the
agricultural development of the west.
Nothing short of fire will check the
progress of an army of hoppers on the
march. Water, unless In wide bodies.
is absolutely no bar to their progress.
The plague comes and in a twinkling
the fields are brown and sere and the
unfortunate farmer sees ruin staring
him in the face.
The grasshoppers themaslves grow
as the crops do, planting in one season
the eggs which are to be hatched in
the next. The female drills a hole in.

abdomen, and in this hole lays about
20 eggs, which are bound together by
a mucus. The burrow is then filled up
with the same menas, which makes it
water tight The eggs are enveloped
in tough little capsules. When new
born, the yonag grasshopper is covered
with a sort of reiL which soon splits
along the back, and he easily gets rid
eof it. As long as th' e is plenty of food
In the neighborbood he takes things
easy and declines to travel far, but once
the provender Is exhausted he starts
out to hunt a new larder. Thus arise
the great migrations of grasshoppers,
narrations of which have caused skep
tical easterners to hold up their hands
I amamsement.
Pefore there was any thought of
waging war on the hopper by scien
tide means the farmer used many
schemes of his own to avert the pest.
His best chance was to destroy the un
hatched eggs. and many schemes were
devised to accomplish this, the most
effective possibly being to slice off an
inch or so of the top soil, dry It and
pass It through sieves to separate the
egg mrasses, which were then burled in
deep itas LEowaan BADwwn.

crime. The Buddhists and Brahmans
of India believe that animals hare
souls which are reborn again on the
earth in like manner with the souls of
human beings. If a horse suddenly,
without any apparent cause, turns upon
Sa man and bites or kicks and tramples
him to death, the Buddhist says it is
because the man tortured the brute in
a past incar:::cton. tilled its animal soul
with thoug'tts of fear and revenge,
which never left it until it was able to
wreak its vc:.,eance long after, for
Hatred ceases not with hatred.
Sounds fanciful and silly, does it. the
Buddhist idea? Well. it is a thousand
pities that so called civilized white
people could not believe it too, for then
the hearts of really civilizdtl white
people would not be harrowed up day
by day with outrages and awful cruel
ties they can do nothing to prevent.
Yon never thought of it probably, but
women are the ones directly responsi
ble for cruelties practiced upon cats
and dogs, upon horses, birds and cattle
and all the tortured live stock proces
sion that follows wailiug and crying
in the wake of the humiuan rare.
Mothers andl women teachers could de
velop the tendernuess that is latent in
the soul of every chi!d. They could
show the children that kicks. cuffs,
burns, starvation and thirst hurt the
animal exactly as much as they hurt
the human.
If the history of every murderer
could be traced back to his childhood,
it would be found nearly always that
he was a boy who stoned cats and
kicked dogs, who neglected to give food
and drink to helpless dumb animals
tastened up so they could not get it for I
themselves.
--4'he other day a lady saw a horse
attached, to a heavy wagon that was
It6pied near a drinking trough. The
poor horse's mouth was parched with
thirst, he was pa ting and qu4veriug
with the beat. be W-as striving desper
ately to reach the water. but the check
rein prevented. The fat brute of a
driver sat upon his perch too lasy to
descend and loosen the rein.
"Do give that horse his head so be
can et a drink," said the lady. The:
two legged brute leered at her impo
dently and said, "Miss. you 'tend to
your business and I'll 'tend to uine,
see?" And the wretched. suffering
horse got no drink. But the lady went
at once and joined the Society For Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals and got
a badge showing her to be a member
of it Next time she sees a human
monster refusing water to a thirsty
horse she will show him that badge
and be t Ill be forced to loosen the
checkrein or be arrested. The dumb
protest of that one tortured horse did
good to his sanering brothers, anyhow.
If the two legged beast who drove
the four footed one had his story told
from childhood, no doubt it would be
found that when his mother moved
away from one house to another she
left the family cat bo starve in the
abandoned home or to be stoned to
death by street boys. Probably, too.,
his woman teacher wore upon her hat
the tender breast of a rare plumaged
bird, torn from it to satisfy the whim
of a bloody. awful fashlou. Perhaps.
too, his'grown up sister wore a fur boa,
with the head, natural and lifelike, of
a mink or a fox dangling from it for
ornament Ornament! Heaven have
mercy on the children whose mothers,
teacbers and sisters do these things!
