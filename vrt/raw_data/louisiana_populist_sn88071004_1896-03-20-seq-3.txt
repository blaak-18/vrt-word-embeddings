Capt. Pharr at Coushatta
March 12th.
Col. Ashl,y styled a '('onfu~ion
ist." Anlti-Foster De'mocra's
well plea-ed.
Over 9)0 men and women of all
ages, assembled to hear the "old
Swamper." despite the dirty nmeth
odIs resorted to by the Fosterites
to kI ep them away. They report
ed small pox in ('Coshatta, and
even haltedi meni at the quanrantine
line from the northern part of the
parish further away from the small
pox than themselves. They said,
"keep 'em out boys, the grand old
Dem,, racy must win, and if they
hear Pharr speak they will vote
for him."
But it did not prevent the house
and the stage from being crowded
with anxious listeners.
We were called to the char and
had tLe pleasure of introducing
our handsowe and eflici, nt nultimIee
for State Supt., Dr (;. A. M.
Cooke, who explitined the political
s tantoan in Louisiana, and spoke
in behalf of public education.
C:'pt. Pharr was then introduced
andl I is short but pointed and for
cible speech for free silver and
protection to Louisiana industries,
brought out prolonged applause.
Col. H. 8. P. Ashby then took
the floor, and never since we have
b.*en in politics has it been our
plea,; re to hear such a speech.
9-tenths of the audienci were sor
ry to see him close. After the
meeting everybody was enthusias
tic in his praise except the C~u
shatta Democrat, which dubbed
him a "confusionist." However,
the Coushatta Citizen says his
spweeh was mostly sound Demo
cratic doctrine, and differed only
in method of applying remedy.
That dreadinl disease, small
pox, has stopped our canvass. (for
the present) in DeSoto f r the
Senatorship, and kept our State
ticket out of several phlces whete
the people were anxiously awaiting
them.
We will carry North Louisiana
for Capt. Pharr.
D. G. FREEMAN.
From Ward 5.
Editor Populist:
The Democrats of this parish
are scattering circulars all over
this (the fifth ward), and I supose'
the rest of the parish as well,
containing an extract from a
speech recently delivered by Cap
tain Pharr in the city of New Or
leans, wherein he said that he had a
been reared with the negro and I
had worked side by side with him,
etc. At the bottom of the Cap
tam's remarks the dreadful ques
tion, "White men of Natcbitoches
parish, can you vote for a man
who boasts of having been "rais- I
.1 with negroest" (or words to
that eteet) is asked. That ques
tion is without doubt a "stunner,"
sad would change the mind of any'
man who did not have enough
se·ne to set a goose on the side of
a hill Why, in my mind's eye, I
see the samint who fatbered that
masterpiece of idiocy stretching
his trembling hand on lugh when
he asked that touching(l) question,
a-d atthe same time turning the
od gates of his isehrymsl canal
loame s entirely that the whole
Leor ao his offoe was Inundated.
I Sml sure that the scene most
have bees a toaching one. The
tl killsr must have ben on the
tk list on that day, or else he
shirlked his pain duty, otherwise
the dmoerati party woulakd have
bed to empltoy amother empaign

'mat thle nh'_' of this circular
:u: no ex(i tion to the rule, and
" ill be o, treated Iy every self
'es twct.tl I  I.
If these duners think they can
change a single vote biy such rot,
they are to, I pitied rather than
censured. Just about all the ef
fect sail circular is producing up
here, is to g:ve our pleople a good
opportunity to work off some of
their gool humor in a hearty
laugh at the folly of such simple
tons.
It seems to me that when the
average old I:arty politician can
find nothing more dam iging against
the opposition to use as politic a
thunder than that the opposition is
telling the truth, he is, with his
party, hanging on a very low
limb with nothing but "tail holt"
and that in an uncertain condition.
To sum the whole thing up in a
nutshell, the Democrats have got a
gigantic piece of stealing to do if
they are to be continued in office,
and they are trying to pave the
way by pretending to use argu
ments to change the minds of the
people. These little dodges will
be followed up with reports in the
old party press that the people are
just fairly falling over each other
with their desire to get back into
the "grand old democratic party."
The finis will be an attempt to
count everything in and out of
sight for the candidates of that
"grand" old party. At this junc
ture the fun will begin, and some
of our blooming ward heelers are
going to "wush they was to hum,"
or some other friendly locality.
The people are thoroughly pre
pared for such a crisis. The pea
pie are weary of being "monkey
ed" with by men who should be
wearing stripes instead of contama
nating society with their polluted
association, and the time has come
to emphasize their objections to
such a regime, which they are sure
to d. on the 21st of April. The
same m n who exterminated car
pet-i aggery in this State will crush
out ballot-box stuffing. If the
Foster gang lave any doubts on
this line, they will be relieved of
these d ,ubts in short order if they
try to thwart th, will of the peo
ple by their old practices.
One of the ward h elers of this
ward has already remarked that he
wou'd rule the ballot box with his
gun I He is a coward and did not
mean anything he said, for he
knows full well, that if he were to
make such a play that there would
not be a greasy spot left of him
within two minutes after the ball
opened. Let him try that game if
he feels so disposed. If we must
fight for our liberties, let it come;
the sooner the better for mankind.
