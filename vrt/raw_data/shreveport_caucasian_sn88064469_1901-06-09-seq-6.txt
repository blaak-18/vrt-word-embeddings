uarseoms' Thread of Cellald.
Celluloid now is put to a new use
that'of making surgeon's thread-and
Its employment, Pay medical men,
marks a decided aIAance in operative
surgery, especially abdominal surgery.
This thread does not slip, it is easy to
thread and easy and supple to stitch
with. Its tensile strength in propor
tion to its caliber is astonishing, and
the necessary process of sterilization
serves only to strengthen it still more.
It may be boiled several times without
deterioration, and after boiling it
swells only slightly, and the little wa
iter which it absorbs can be eliminated
by preserving the thread afterward in
alcohoL
While this thread is not absorbed by
the tissues, yet its use for several
months has shown that it is "organiz
ed" over and buried aseptically by the
issues. It is predicted that it will su
srede silk entirely, as it is cheaper,
re trustworthy, stronger and work
with more easily.

telo'lr of M.lu. the l Isim ad wihre the
ulltll of the lrelio llit .es l t llouett
that timn a young Aintirillan went froit
Manila to thle jort of Jolu. which was
not so hard to do. The sulinn of Sulu
was far Inland. The American re
soilved to visit him. The sultan had
heard of the United States and had an
Indefinite Idea that there were a few
American soldiers In Luzon. He made
up his exalted mind that'he would
whip out the United States and settle
things. He had his army all ready If
any white soldiers came his way.
This was his state of mind when
-oung Mr. Albert Lawles, the Amer
can. appeared with an Interpreter be
fore the gates of his grass palace to
make a friendly call. But the sultan of
Sulu swelled bimself up like the frog
and a&oumed a high and haughty mien.
He ordered the venturesome white man
t be put Into prison for that night and
o be put to death next morning. The
sentence would certainly have mate
iallsed only for the nerve and re
sourcefulnes of Lawles. He. too. as
Bmied a haughty mien and demanded
o be led before the sultan. It is be
ond dispute that there is something
bout a white man that cows a savage.
Lwles' reqouet was granted. He be
pon t once tellin the druky lord to
CEIZFI
the isles how big and great the United
States was, assarig him In the most
solemn manner that if be himself
should be put to death white soldiers
would come and wreak such vengeance
that not a grass hut would be left to
the Sulus.
"But I have my army all ready to
meet them and kill every man if they
come," said the dusky despot.
Lawles made a grimace of contempt.
"How many soldiers have you?" he
asked.
"I've got 1.500," replied the frog,
puffing himself up.
"Well," said the American. looking
him in the eye, "do you know that in
Luzon. in Panay and in Mindanao the
United States has already 40 times as
many men as you have in your whole
army, and it can send here as ny
more wmen as there are stars in th -y.
You touch a bair of my head, and the
white soldiers will wipe the Sulu is
lands off the earth. This is the truth.
It is better for you to make friends
with the great white sultan. If you
do. and if you treat me well, the Amer
icans will stilt let you be the ruler of
Sulu. I shall tell the great white sul
tan that you are the friend of the
Americans, and he will let you stay
where you are."
Lawles was talking for his life, argu
ing against tine, and he spared not
lurid coloring, but laid it on thick, and
he wasted no moments. Hle talked to
the sultan till 2.o'i-lok in the imoruning,
arguing, threatening, describing the
ghastly consequences to the sultan of
Sulu If he should put himpself in oppo
sition to the bnited States. At length
he prevajled wkh the "nigger' king.
who releed hir with honors ani as
sured him that Siuu would not wile
out the American nation. Amnd this is
howit lappened that the southern na
tives welcomed Americans. i .
