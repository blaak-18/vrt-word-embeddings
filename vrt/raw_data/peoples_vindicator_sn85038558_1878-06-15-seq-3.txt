EIITOR OF VINDICATOR:
Sonme people would say that it was a
rathearsingular coincidence, that at the
very iuoiieiint when I was closing lettier
No. 2. h rcalling public altention to thei
fa;t that our reform Governor had np to
that moment been utterly silent in re
gtard to the Louisiana State Lottery, the
ellfiremlient by tlhis Inonopiyol of the
arbitrary a nd nlltonstitutiionl legisla
tion in its heh'alf was rapidly culhnina
tiug in a Iheavy blow at its own exis
tence. So rapid was the culnination
that I fo10,d myself in dlty bound to
nporarily abandonl th regulal.r conltext
otf ini" let te's. ami to de'vote letter No. 3
to a el.hrnoicle of the great event of the
Now,\\ I do not regardl this event as a
ilattel of coincidence am all, but as a pure
case of cause and effect. The Lottery
ten are only of the average run of their
splec'ieS. They are engaged ill all enter
lprise that recolnlllend itself to them in
but one aspect-the making of money,
anll a plenty of it. It is clear that their
priniple of action is-"the end justifies
the nmealns,'-and the means they deter
milied inl their calculations to be mnost
etlicient was to invalle successfully the
pridne natural rights of those around
them l and the rest was plain sailing.
To eth-et this, they laid their foinda
tion sagaciously, and all their calcula
tilons were solllund, save one, They made
no prolper calculation against two char
;cteristies of lman, or they were igno
rant of tlheil--viz: patriotism and oh
stinay--tlle latter, at the present day
I, iing often called "plue cnssedleess."'
There aret very good reasons why they
should not have calculated on eneouut
ering the first namloed trouble. In tile
first ph'Ie, they have clearly shown that
they have none of the characteristic
themlselves. III the second place, their
perfect control of the existing adminis
tration ftrnished the best reason why
they should doubt the existence of such
a thing in others.
But it is not so easy to aceoalt for their
miscalculation on the second count. There
it no doult that the State authorities
had ladl' tile path as smooth as they
could for the Lottery, but tlhey ought to
have knlwnI that man is possessed of at
least as much pride as a mule, and that
there are some liberties you cannot with
impunity take with a mule. Any planta
tion negro will tell you that.
"Pure enssedless" on any subject is to
be expected of man, but it is pre-eml
nently apt to be displayed if you ruth
lessly invade what he calls his political
rights; and more especially if you un
dertake to confiscate his private shot
gun, or to stick him in the parish prison
because he sells Havana lottery tickets
ol commnission, in order to feed his fami
Iv. And then there is another thing.
If yot' find your next door neighbor or
dei'ing around and utilizing, as against
yourself, the servants whom you pay to
do vOIlr own work, your "pure cussed
ness" is almost sure to assert itself. This
is what Charlie Howard was doing with
our Police, and, notwithstanding, the
Legislature and all the rest of the authori
ties sustained himn, the people kicked in
the traces. And so will it be to the end
of the world. Charlie Howard will
learn before lie gets through that it is
one thing to run a lottery, and another
to run a State.
It was not a mere coincidence then,
tllhat the Agosti Haibeas Corpus case oc
curred just a1s I was engaged in crititei
sig the course of our adlministration
towards the lottery. No, tie whole
thing occurred under the direct rules of
cause and efftect-just as much so as the
occurrances of the fourteenth of Sep.
tember. The seed was planted by the
Radicals, the tree has been nurnsed and
cherishedl hy our administration, and
this es the bitter, but legitinmate fruit.
But I proceed with my analysis of the
platform on which the State is being
conducted, and which I have stated in
Letter No. 2, under 9 different heads.
Under head No. i, I charge that the
policy of the administration is thle con
tinned fostering of monopolies.
No man can gainsay the truth of tile
charge. In the case of the Louisiana
State Lottery, the most gigantic and
most dangerous of these monopolies, the
proof is overwhelming., In regard to
any other monopoly, I defy any man to
show that the weight of one legislative
or executive finger has been raised
against one of them-and if these great
evils exist, and are so repulsive that the
people considered their representatives
bound to attack them;antd yet they
have not been attacked, but have, to a
greater or less extent, put the powers
that hie under intagined obligations to
them; I, therefore argue that they are
fostered by the governmenlt, in dlirect
violation, both of the will of the people
and of the pledges given by those en
trlusted with State control.
Head No. 6, says tile policy of the
powers that be, is "no Radical inrold on
the State Constitution; consequently no
Conveution of the people."
Surely, no man can deny this feature
of the policy of our rulers; and it is one
of tile most repulsive of all.
If there be one feature of reformation
above all others on which thlis people
had set their hearts, which their judge
ment told them was above all others
necessary, and which they considered
their chosen rulers solemnly pledged to,
it was the asneembling of a Constitutional
Convention for the purpose of estab
lishing an organic law elmanating fromn
the people. The organic law under
which we have for years been living is
the spawn of military despotism, and
shows I:te despicable parentage all over
its hideous face. It has been loathed
and cursed by every intelligent and
thoroughly patriotic man in the State
ever since its birth, and its utter annal
hilation has been the nightly dream of
all who love country for country's sake.
I undertake to say, that not one of the
servants of the lpeople now holding of
tice from Governor down to Constable,
could have procured a nomination if he
had proclaimed himself opposed to thor
ough revision of the Constitution by the
people in Conventiou assembled-and if
any one of them, in the face of all we
have suffered at the hands of despotism
and lawlesseeness, bad dared to suggest
that we were electing a legislature that
would arrange the present Constitution
for us, to the extent of twenty amend
meats -leaving untouched the most obÂ·
jectionable features-I think that indi
vidual would not only have failed a nom
ination, but would have been put in a
Lonatic Asylum by his friends.
It is very difficult for a man who reads
and thinks, and is at the same time at
all zealous for relief of his State from
bad government, to speak or write tem
perately of conduct in public ofieials
like this we re considering. I cannot
do either without a rising of the gorge.
I am indignant at the utter faithlessness
exhibited, and I am disappointed at the
delay put upon our material reactiont;
or, fl I am to believe for one moment in
the sincerity of these men, then I am
shocked at the utter dearth of political
sagacity exhibited.
But, I do not believe in their sincerity,
and, therefore, for their intelligence I
have more respect than they care for
mb to have. No, the conduct of these men
amounts simply to either amazintg po
litical cowardice, or to wanton abandon
ment of the general interest in favor of
that of the few, or to both. I believe
that it is both. Ilam sare that some of
thes men never sought the positions
they hold, except to w.,rk for udi' iduaI
ends or the ends of "rings," and the.'e
men1 have preyed on the weakness of+
others. But, I do not ottffer a word of
apology for this weakness. On the con
Strary, I despise it, and I regard it as
morel' dangerous to liberty and the cause
of go .d governmentI, than dishonesty it
self. 'Tlhere is sonlething declared about
a dilihonest man; he is a warning in

you gave rue credit for common sense
now you have otlher Iasters to serve,
and I am a d--n fool."
And this is the whole thing in a nut
shell.
Let the people of Louisiana not be de.
ceived on this great and underlying liles
tion of a Coustitutional Convention. All
objections to it conies from "the money
power," the holders of unnecessarf of
tices, and the receivers of exhorbitanut
public salaries or perquisites in office
and those public officials who have thus
far defeated the public demand for a
Convention are either the instruments of
one or all of the elements, or else are so
feeble of opinion as to be worse than ac
tive enemies.
Another every day argument of the
anti-Conventiou otlicials I must not
forget to record here. All of them speak
the little speech as glibly as the ten
years old school boy does his commuence
mient platform exercise, though not as
innocently. This so-called "argument'
is, that in 'the present excited state of
the people-tiushed as they are with
hard won victory over a relentless and
despotic political foe-they Pre not to be
trusted in Constitutional Convention;
they would surely run into excess. After
awhile, when the cool anid sober second
thought posses them, it may be right to
hold a Convention."
If this "argument" were uttered in
sincerity, I should be forced to brand it
as insensate twaddle, and worse than
unworthy of real men; but there is no
sincerity in it, and if the people do not
mark and punish every holder who has
dared thus to insult their patriotism and
intelligence, then they deserve to wear
the collar of servitude all their days.
Talk of the people of Louisiana going
to "excess" in Constitutional Convention
assembled !-What part of the history of
this people thus characterizes them I
On the contrary, does not their conduct
under Warnothianl and Kellogian rule
prnve tlhen to lie Ilhnost crininally pa
iientl Look back to the 14th of Sep
timber, 1874, when with aroms in thui
hands they strangled despotism in ali
hour and paid the price of the best blood
in the land ! Who, then, was guilty of
"excess'," not onCe man. And was not
that the hour for "exceass," if it was ever
to come i Could we not then have wip
ed out of existence the last villain who
had had his accur ed foot upon our neck i
And if we had done so, even though the
haunts of unreasoning and ravening
Radicalism would have seethed and boil
ed over with howling condemnation,
would we have found no hearts to have
symnpathized with and approved the act i
"Exces" indeed! Would it be "ex
cess" to frame a Constitution like thpt
of Pennsylvania, or like unto any other
in this country that has emanated from
thinking and patriotic people ? And do
the people of Louisiana desire a Consti
tutiou worse than that of Pennsylvania i
Out Iupon the faithless political huck
ster in oilice, who, while holding lucra
tive or honorable position at til hands
if the people he has flattered aid ca
joled into trusting him, plays basely
false in their hour of need, and even
insults their manhood and intellhgence! i
If additional proof were wanted in re
gard to the woiderful patience and for
bearance of the people of Louisiana in
matters political, it is clearly to be found
in the calmness with which they have
received the hitherto unheard of action
of the late legislature in virtually resolv
ing itself into a Constitutional Convei
tion, and offering their usurpatory apawn
to the votes of their constituents
Let us hope that the calmness with
which this outrage is received is no inu
dication of suhbmuission to the indignity or
acquiescence in the wrong. On the cou
trary, let us hope that it is but that
calni which precedes the storm, and that
through the ballot box this fall, the men
who composed the last legislature will
receive a rebuke which will make them
hang their heads in shame and confiu
sion.
It will never !o for the people of
Louisiana to even appear to sanction the
outrageous usurpation attempted by the
last legislature in offering to their votes
some twenty amendments to a Constitu
tion which the people never framed, and
at the same time retaining intact the
most odious and oppressive features of
the instrument. Even if the amend
ments included the elimination of every
objectionable feature, a people tenacious
of their rights and watchful over their
liberties will never permit servants
whom they have appointed to perform
specific duties to so far transcend their
functions as to attempt the manufacture
of an organic law for them.
In the past ten years I have passed
with my people through all the deep
humiliation that attends subordnlination
to resistless military despotism, and this
ordeal is the great erucible which tries
the metal of which we are made. I have
seen niany fall on the wayside, sick at
heart, weary, fainting, yet loyal in spirit.
I have seen others die from sheer exhaus
tion. And I have seen not a few desert,
go over to the enemy, and become the
worst persecutors of their former friends.
But the great army of the people has
clung together and waited patiently for
that day of delivery which was surely
to come as a reward for faithful adhe
rence to the undying principles which
underlie legitimate and beneficeial gov
ernment. The people have been faithful
to themselves in the face of a foreign
foe; will they be less faithfnl in presence
of the foe that strikes from within
Will they use their ballots to rivit chains
upon their wrists more galling when
realized, more ditficelt to rend asunder
than those just broken to pieces and
cast at the feet of our foes
I will only believe in the quiet sub
mission of my people to domestic usur
pation when I see them cast their blI1ote
