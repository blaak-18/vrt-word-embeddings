28. That five by three feet is the
hest distance to plant corn on medi

29. That pulling fodder does not
unriously injure the corn after it pass

30 Thlat superphliosphiate is the best
",rtilizer for leguminous plants, not
lnecauise it is a preferred food, but
teeaose available phosphoric acid is
hdefiuient in our soils.

Lni turnips and fertilizing the soil, as
well as for the wool and mutton, and
