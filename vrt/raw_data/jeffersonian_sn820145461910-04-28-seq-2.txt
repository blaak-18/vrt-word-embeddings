FROM ONE OF THE MANLIEST
MEN THAT EVER TROD
SHOE-LEATHER!
My Dear Watson: —Find my
check for $2.10 enclosed. Send the
weekly Jeff to William Clifton, Da
rien. Ga., and the Magazine to E. J.
Limehouse, 1008 Montgomery street,
Savannah. Ga. The range of your
guns lias reached at last the circle of
the globe.
It now looks as though I will make
a clean sweep for the Legislature
from Effingham. If T do, one of the
old guard, as in days of yore, will be
on the firing line, and you will be re
lieved at least of some cussing; I will
divert their attention, at least, long
enough to give you time to reload.
You know my lifelong devotion to
you, that grows with the days of my
age.
I do not believe it is necessary or
wise, that you waste your time and
strength, I mean out of the State,
speaking to entertain the gangs of
politicians that fill modern conven
tions. The battles that you are now
fighting, for the common people, and
the sweep of the tremendous and
ever-growing sentiment that you
have kindled, is reaching in many
sections a condition of panics, and
your enemies must be watched. I
am, sincerely yours,
DON. W. CLARK.
Savannah, Ga.
ENOCH GILES IS ALL RIGHT.
Dear Sir: —As you have no “bat
tle” in your district to fight in the
present Congressional race, will you
please help us put in a new broom in
this, the first? T want Mr. Edwards
next out, and I believe that if you
will give him a write-up, as you are
able to do, it will go far towards
helping us out. I want your to pour
it into him, hot and heavy!
I don’t know just what there is in
Mr. Giles, his opponent in the race,
but if we can get him in, it will be a
new broom, and T believe that The
Jeffersonian can help make him
sweep clean when we get him in.
As you told Bro. Lengee Brough
ton, “give us a yell or three on this
line”. Set The Jeff to lumbering,
and see if we can’t get Charley start
ed ong roat to Salt river.
Yours truly, A VOTER.
Ed Comment: — Confidential infor
mation has been given me by one
who knows, and who has no axe to
grind.
In consequence of this, I am able
to assure my friends that they will
make no mistake in supporting
Enoch Giles against that slippery lit
tle deserter, Charles Edwards.

THE HIGHER OFFICE AND THE
WIDER FIELD.
My Dear Sir: —Once more, I am
about to worry you; but, to begin
with, beg you to only read my
thoughts, put the letter in your trash
basket, and use your valuable time
as you see fit, instead of answering,
<Hid I shall continue to think just as
much of you.
I don’t know how to write my
thoughts without being a little per
sonal, so pardon personalities.
Mr. Watson, T travel the First and
Tenth Congressional Districts, and if
the rest of the people of Georgia are
like they are in my territory, you
could get a majority of votes for
anything you would ask. “Things
are coming your way”. Why not be
Georgia’s greatest Governor? Geor
gia needs a man with “backbone”,
one who will enforce the law, if the
law is against selling whiskey, and T
believe you would do that, or quit, as
you did the Democratic party when
they were going wrong. You refused
to follow such a party, against the
people, and I firmly believe you
should have the credit for getting
them a few steps toward right. For
the sake of the people, run for Gov
ernor. Your friend,
ROBERT J. VIDETTO, M. D.
Answer.
Dr. Robert J. Videtto, Augusta, Ga.
My Dear Friend: —I appreciate
your interest in my work, and your
highly complimentary opinion of my
self; but you don’t quite understand
me. I don’t want any office, and I
have no axe to grind. Were I to an
nounce myself as a candidate for any
place whatsoever, I would immedi
ately lose a portion of the influence
which I have earned as an independ
ent, unselfish friend of the common
people.
What could Ido as Governor? It
is one of the least of opportunities.
The duties of the office are circum
scribed, and hardly any initiative is
possible. Were I in Congress, I
wouldn’t be as free as I am now:
were I in the Senate, I couldn’t
reach the people whom I reach every
week and month through the two
Jeffersonians. The fact that things
are coming my way is largely due to
the conviction that is spreading
throughout the country that I am
not after money, and not after office,
but am consecrating the remaining
years of my life to this work, which
makes for the good of my country.
It would be nothing short of a ca
lamity to lose this prestige, and take
rank merely as an additional office
holder.
Very truly yours,
THOS. E. WATSON.

BOYS LIABLE FOR ROAD TAX.
Dear Sir;—Some of our old friends
are under the impression that a boy
under tw r enty-one years old is not
subject to road tax. Please state
whether or not, under the road law,
he is subject to pay or not in your
next Jeff. lam a subscriber to The
Jeff. All for T. E. W.
Your friend,
Avera, Ga. J. F. DIXON.
Answer.
In my judgment, the road law now
in operation in this State is not only
a cruel hardship in many cases, but
is unconstitutional. It is alost uni
versally disliked, and it is a marvel
to me that the people do not come
together, County by County, and
chip in to raise a fund to employ
some good lawyer to test the consti
tutionality of it. Until that is done,
it will have to be obeyed.

THANKS FROM A YOUNG MAN.
ATy Dear Sir: —Will you please ac
cept the sincere thanks of a young
man for the third chapter of your
editorial, “Socialists and Socialism”,
which I have just read in your De
cember Jeffersonian?
Sincerely yours,
CHAS. O. JAAP, JR.

Is your neighbor taking The Jef

WORKS SELF TO DEATH.
Des Moines, April 14.—John Bar
kis, aged sixty-five years, was found
dead in bed this morning. His son,
the only support of the aged man
and the son's wife and family of
children, died recently and Barkis
worked himself to death, trying to
care for the family.
Dear Sir: —The above clipping
from a daily paper suggests heathen
dom in our midst, and demands an
other broadside from your big guns.
Go after the responsible ones like a
cyclone to awaken the sons of Cain
who would ask: “Am I my brother's
keeper?”
Twelve or thirteen years ago, or
before the Spanish-American war,
and under Cleveland, Harrison, et
al., if you met a Democrat he would
tell you that had produced so much
that there was no market for it; con
sequently, you could get no money.
The next man you met, if a Republi
can, he would say if you had produc
ed anything to sell you could get
money.
History says we had 13 dollars
per capita. Cleveland piled up the
silver under the Sherman law, the
war came, they coined, they bonded
us, to buy more bullion to coin mil
lions more, 16 to 1. Gold was coined
free, they bonded us to issue Nation
al Bank circulation, they issued mil
lions of treasury notes, greenbacks,
etc., under Roosevelt; it had increas
ed to 30 and 31 or so, now the esti
mate is near 35, or more perhaps,
and we have increased in numbers
91,000,000 a year, and I read in to
day’s press that the pleasure-seekers
are so numerous that all sterage is
exhausted for months to come, which
proves to my mind, first of all, that
the money is comeatable to pay for
it. I also read that, people who left
America on account of the panic of
1907 are flocking back. Why? Be
cause of the demand for labor and its
products—prices for labor high,,
prices for products to live on high,
because the money is flowing at least
a little more freely just at present.
While wages have advanced abroad
of late, they have advanced more
here. I read all this in today’s pa
per, and Bryan clinched the whole
thing in his doubtful letter, that I
also read today, in his last paragraph
and turned the tables on the Repub
licans. And these, one and all, com
bine to prove that it is the money,
first and last, that gives impetus or
stagnates the system, with all the
minor ills croping out here and there
to breed blighting disease when the
blood begins to stagnate, which is to
the interest of old Dr. Gold Standard
Bond, advocate interest sapping
money shark and the father of
all trusts. As long as labor is in
demand and the money ready to pay
for it let prices soar as long as it is
at a supply and demand price. But
when money begins to soar at a sup
ply and demand price, then cometh
swift destruction.

NEVER KNOCKS THE WRONG ONE
My Dear Friend: —I say “My dear
friend” because I know that your
large heart is a friend to everybody
even if in deadly hostility to many
things.
You certainly are a “Knocker.” A
Master Knocker, sure and certain.
And what is worst about the Knocker
(on the knocked, of course), is that
he never knocks at the wrong door,
whether it be of “White House”, or
Mission house.
Os all the grand things that you
have said, and are constantly saying,
to my way of thinking, the grandest,
is, “I am holding a po-
sition and doing a work that I would
not exchange for any office on this
earth.” If I could fill your shoes-I
would shout a hearty amen, “ditto
in dis corner.”
Yours very truly,
JNO. B. BATT.

A PLEA FROM A PREACHER, FOR
THE GUILTY POOR.
Dear Mr. Watson: —I am a Bap
tist preacher, who has given the best
part of my life to. frontier work, with
little compensation for time and la
bor rendered. But I appreciate your
move to stir up our people to see
after our own needy and poor. I have
nothing to say against Foreign Mis
sions, but I have much to say against
present methods. But there is noth
ing appeals to me as much as the
needs in our own land. We have not
only thousands of poor and needy,
but many are even more vicious than
many in heathen lands. Many are •
ready to slight them for that reason,
but if they are vicious so much the
more they need our pity; God helps
the Christian poor. My prayers are
continually, going up for the guilty
who are suffering. The Christian
poor have the sunshine of hope to
help in troubles. The guilty who
suffer are wretched indeed. Pity, by
all means, the innocent who suffer,
but pity far more the guilty. The
mark of the murderer’s hand may be
on the tenement wall, but I fear God
only sees that hand through the more
favored homes of the rich and those
who through neglect fail to do what
they can to remedy these sad condi
tions. Just why our people, espe
cially our church people, have gone
mad over the benighted heathen,
while they don’t seem to care about
the “benighted” at home, I can’t tell.
