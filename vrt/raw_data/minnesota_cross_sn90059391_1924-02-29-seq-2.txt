(Barr.nu of I’ubllralktn and education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 19.
Borrowers of money, producers and
•ther ultimate tax payers interested
In the tax measure now pending be
fore congress will be given an oppor
tunity to express their views on this
legislation before it is written into
law. It is planned that a number
«f tax congresses will be held in all
sections of the nation in the near
future, as it is realized that this
measure is up now in the house of
representatives and will soon be up
in the senate.
It is proposed to hold these meet
ings in Richmond, Va., Asheville, N.
CL; Salt Lake City, Utah; Portland.
Oregon; Omaha, Neb.; Detroit, Mich.;
Pittsburgh, Pa.; Boston, Mass.; Dal
las Texas; and Jacksonville, Fla.
To Held General Congress.
Following the state congresses, a
general ccngress will be held in
Washington, when the findings of the
body will be presented to the senate
finance committee. Dates for hold
ing these meetings have not been an
■ounced but will be fixed in the near
future.
The meetings will be non-partisan.
Jo it is stated, and the purpose of
the gatherings will be to assemble
accurate and comprehensive expres
sions of the people for the informa
tion of members of congress in deal
ing with the subject. It has been
decided that the first meeting to be
held at Richmond, Va., will be held
an Saturday, March 15.
The invitations going out for these
sectional meetings read as follows:
“We invite those who borrow,
those who lend, and those who invest
in productive enterprises into a citi
■ens council to discuss fundamental
problems of government, and we are
going to invite leading members of
congress to join with us in these
deliberations. The issue has no place
in partisan politics, and our discus
sion will be economic and in the
public interest."
Want Taxpayers’ Views.
All taxpayers are urged to attend
these group meetings for the purpose
•f expressing their views on tax leg
islation now pending before congress.
And in the house this week the
members are voting. So far it looks
like the Democrats aided and abetted
hy the Republican insurgents are
carrying the day over the regular
Republicans. The insurgents in the
Bouse and senate holding the bal
ance of power, are using it whenever
they see fit to do so and the major
ity party is at their mercy. It’s an
interesting situation.

Little grains of “sand,”

DAUGHERTY HOLDS ON
TO CABINET POSITION
Attorney General Will Not Give
Up Without Putting Up
, a Strong Fight
(Rurenn of Publication and Kducatlon)
WASHINGTON. D. C., Feb. 23.
Attorney General Harry M. Daugh
erty is not going to quit the cabinet
without a fight, so he says, and those
who know him best believe what he
says. The attorney general’s in
clination and present intention is to
fight. He feels 1 „• has committed no
wrong, he feels he is clear in the
oil mess, and he believes his admin
istration of the department of jus
tice will stand the test of any in
vestigation.
He has asked the senate commit
tee to investigate all it pleases and
he is urging it be done at once.
Those who know Daughertty real
well admit he is a fighter and that
he will not be forced out of his po
sition without a cause being shown
and proven against him.

Cross Suspended
In Air Blazes at
Klemme, lowa
KLEMME, IA.. Feb. 20. One of
the most unique innovations in the
burning of a nery cross that has yet
been tried, was carried out here last
Thursday evening when the blazing
emblem of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan was suspended in mid-air
on a wire stretched between two
buildings. Apparently there was
nothing supporting the cross, and it
made a most impressive sight to the
people in the street.
The cross was burned near a dance
hall where a disorderly crowd is in
the habit of congregating. Thursday
most of those in the hall came out to
view the cross. Five dancers, young
men from Goodell, lowa, a towm near
here, attempted to tear down the
cross.
It was not until the town marshal
learned of their activities that they
ceased and were ordered to leave
town.
Two aerial bombs were exploded,
and it was only a few moments until
hundreds of people filled the street
COUNTRY IS READY
FOR TAX DECREASES
Time for Congress to Quit Play
ing Polities and Get Down
to Brass Tucks
(Run-;in of l*u hi lent lon and education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 18.—
The country is unanimous for tax
reduction, no matter which party is
sitting in the saddle, and people are
heartily tired of both parties play
ing politics while the folks back
home are bearing the burdens. Hence,
the cry goes up: “Quit playing poli
tics and give us a genuine tax re
duction.”
Aroused by the action of the Dem
ocratic caucus of the house of rep
resentatives in making the Garner
rates in the pending tax measure a
test of democracy, the American
Bankers league, through its presi
dent, issued a statement calling up
on its membership to repudiate the
actions of any party caucus, by de
manding of congress a non-partisan
consideration of the measure.
“We challenge the authority of
any group of congressmen to de
throne the judgment or despoil the
wisdom of their colleagues or to
render invalid the constitutional
right of a sovereign to instruct his
representative in congress,” the
statement read. ,
“The Garner rates are no more of
a test of democracy than they are a
test of religion. Such procedure
strikes down free institutions and
makes us a government by politici
ans, instead of a government by the
people. If this government is to
maintain the confidence of the Amer
can people, congressmen must con
sult them on fundamental princi
ples and must realize that those
who pay the taxes have an equity in
this legislation that cannot be
abridged by a political caucus.”
In other words its time to quit
playing politics and get down to
brass tacks. If we are going to have
tax reduction its time for men of
all parties to get together and put
through he needed legislation. Mem
bers of congress are not fooling the
people back home about this. The
way to get tax reduction is to vote
it and quit making so many political
speeches about it for home consump
tion in the coming political cam
paign.
Alabama. The personnel of the sub
committee is as follows:
Senators Moses, of New Hamp
shire; Edge, of New Jersey; Oddie, of
Nevada; Heflin, of Alabama; and
Trammell, of Florida. The first three
named are Republicans and the lat
ter two belong to the Democratic
party.
This is the subcommittee whieh
R. B. Creager, Republican national
committeeman for Texas, said would
never be named as he gave out state
ment after statement to the press
that Senator Heflin was only bluff
ing and that nothing would ever
come of the investigation.
This subcommittee will meet in
the near future, organize and begin
holding hearings on the alleged Tex
as land frauds, whether Mr. Creager
likes it or not. Creager is the man
who charges all this muss up to the
Ku Klux Klan, as his company is
mixed up in the investigation, and
naturally he does not like the no
toriety and publicity.
Mr. Creager is also the man who
says he is going to have the Repu
blican and Democratic parties in na
tional conventions assembled this
coming summer insert planks in
theiri respective platforms reading
the Ku Klux Klan out of existence.

THE FIERY CROSS
PRESIDENT LIVES
UP TO HIS NAME
OF COOL CALVIN
History Is Being Made in
Words Since Oil Was Dis
covered on Potomac
VANDER‘S’LI>S TALK
Borah Tells Daugherty to His
Face He Is Embarrassment
to Administration
(Rurtau of Publication and education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 20
A good deal has been said from time
to time about history being made in
Washington. Now this word history
has been changed to hysteria, and
Washington is full of it ever since
oil was discovered on the Potomac.
Hysteria has driven Secretary of
the Navy Denby to resign his office
after the senate tried its best to
get him to resign. Now hysteria is
after Attorney General Daugherty
and it may get him as it did Denby
before the end of the fight; Hysteria
has besmirched prominent candidates
for the presidency, it has soiled the
chances of young ‘Teddy” Roosevelt
for the time being in his ambitions
for the gubernatorial nomination in
New York in which he had hoped to
tread the path taken by his illustri
ous father. It has likewise involved
one public officer, and it is said that
a prominent U. S. senator has gotten
his fingers oiled up, but for some rea
son the senate committee has not yet
given to the public his name. The
people will, no doubt, demand to know
who he is just the same as the names
of all the others have been made pub
lic. There is no legitimate reason
why a senator should escape in this
dragnet. This senator is said to have
profited immensely in speculation in
Sinclair oil stock on account of the
tips he received through a broker
age house.
Mr. McAdoo may come back, but
his coming is uncertain. One man
of prominence says that “McAdoo is
eligible but not available.” That may
hit the nail on the head right now.
A New Slogan
President Coolidge seems to have
emerged from all this hysteria and
oil excitement without being smeared
to any great degree. Here is a new
slogan originated by a Washington
man the other day: “Calvin Coolidge
trusts the country to trust him.”
That will be verified or disproven
next November when the voters have
their say at the polls.
Right now Attorney General
Daugherty is in the spotlight on the
American stage. Will he resign or
will he not? That’s the question the
people are asking. He says he won’t
retire under fire. That’s a good one
if he can make it stick. Senator
Wheeler, of Montana, is after him
with a resolution and vitriolic at
tacks in the senate. By the way,
Montana seems to be coming to the
front in these investigations. It was
Senator Walsh, of Montana, who
pushed matters in the oil cases and
got Denby’s goat in the wind-up.
Now his colleague, Senator Wheeler,
serving his first session in the senate,
has started after the legal head of
the government. Montana seems ap
parently a monopoly on starting
these investigations, all of which
makes good copy and interesting
reading nowadays. Senator Borah, of
Idaho, has joined Wheeler and others,
and wants Daugherty to move on.
The Idaho senator went up to the
White House the other night to talk
it over with the president, and much
to his surprise found Mr. Daugherty
present, but that did not stop the
senator from Idaho, who never lacks
courage in anything he undertakes,
whether right or wrong. He told
Mr. Daugherty to his face, in the
presence of the president, so it is
reported, that the country had ap
parently lost confidence in Mr.
Daugherty and that he ought to get
out and save embarrassment to the
president. That was a little raw to
say nothing of being unpleasant, but
Borah thought it his duty to speak
out in meetin’ and he did.
Washington newspaper men seem
to have reached the conclusion that
at this time Mr. Daugherty has
ceased to be an asset to the Coolidge
administration and becomes a lia
bility.
Insult to Cummins
In reviving his resolution, Senator
Wheeler has openly insulted Senator
Cummins, president pro tern of the
senate, by insisting on naming the
committee to handle the Daugherty
investigation according to the view
expressed by some of the regular
senators. It has always been the
custom to have the chair name such
committees, but in this instance Sen
ator Wheeler wanted to name the
men and he suggested that the Daugh
erty committee consist of himself as
chairman; and Senators Brookheart,
of Iowa; Jones, of Washington; Mc-
Lean, of Connecticut; and Ashhurst.
of Arizona.
Hysteria in Washington has cre
ated a new name for Frank A. Van
derlip, prominent banker of New
York City, who testified here before
the oil committee recently. He is
now dubbed "Vanderslip” on account
of the terrible break he made in tra
ducing the memory of a dead presi
dent. All of the ugly, nasty, muss
he stirred up over former President
Harding selling his newspaper in
Marion, Ohio, and trying to hook
that deal up with the oil troubles,
fell flatter than a flounder. There
wasn't the slightest foundation for
such nasty rumors, and the truth
came out in unquestionable testimony
Klan Plans to
Educate Race ,
Ne&ro Is Told
MONONGAH. W. VA., Feb. 25.-
That the Knights -of the Ku Klux
Klan is planning a program of pro
tection for negroes against putrid
politicians and is fighting for better
educational facilities for colored
races was made kxown here today
when Mrs. Mary Lewis, an aged col
ored woman, of this city, made pub
lic a letter recently received from
the great American organization set
ting forth the plan of the Klan.
The missive was written following
the burning of several crosses and
the explosion of many bombs in the
vicinity of the Lewis home. In the
note the Klan made it plain to the
colored woman that it is the plan ot
the Klan to help and not oppress the
colored race. Officials of the great
American order stated in the letter
that they believed putrid politicians
throughout the country had used ig
norant colored folks to further the
plans of politicians at the polls.
“Fairmont, W. Va.,
“February 11, 1924.
“Mrs. Mary Lewis,
“Monongah, W. Va.,
“Dear Madam:
“The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
have on several occasions burned
crosses and exploded some dynamite
in your neighborhood, and have un
derstood that you were uneasy and
perhaps wanted to know why this
was done.
“We take this method of giving
you the enclosed cash token of friend
ship. first, to show that we do not
hold any malice against the colored
race, and more especially against
you, and hope you will receive this
little token from us not for its in
trinsic value, but in the spirit in
which it is given. It comes from
men who are really interested in
your race of people and are trying
to help instead of oppress. We be
lieve that the corrupt politicians of
our country have used may of your
people, who are ignorant, for their
own political purposes, and we pro
pose to see that you folks have an
education and are protected from
those who have used you for their
own interests. Believing, of course,
that the white race should and al
ways will remain supreme.
“Second, we take this method of
letting you know that you have I
many unknown friends in Monongah :
who are praying for a speedy recov
ery in this, your illness. With these
thoughts in mind we hope that when
ever there is a cross burned or dyna
mite exploded in your community,
you will know that it is not meant
for you or any of your race in par
ticular.
“Very Sincelery yours,
“Fairmont Klan,
“Knights of the Ku Klux Klan."
from men who knew the inside of that
newspaper deal.
This will 9erve as a valuable les
son to others who let their tongues
wabble around on rumors circulated
by scandalmongers who have noth
ing. not even a reputation, to lose.
The surprise in this case is that a
man of Mr. Vanderlip’s standing and
reputation should stoop to give ut
terance to ugly rumors which had
no solid foundation. The committee
made him look like thirty cents when
he was on the witness stand, and he
too has learned a lesson, but through
a tremendous sacrifice to himself.
It’s bad enough to say such things
about a living president, but when a
man attacks the dead who cannot de
fend, it’s stooping to a level to which
no man, let alone a banker of promi
nence, cares to descend.
Insurgents Insurglng
The house insurgents are again in
surging by joining the house Denifo
crats to defeat the Mellon income
tax rates. The 17 insurgents spurned
all the amendments offered, and vot
ed with the Democrats, and they,
holding the balance of power, gave
the regular Republicans a licking to
the tune of 222 to 1%. The Garner
Democratic income tax substitute
was adopted instead. It provides
normal taxes of two per cent on in
comes of less than $5,000; four per
cent on incomes between $5,000 and
$8,000; 6 per cent on incomes exceed
ing SB,OOO.
A graduated surtax scale beginning
at 1 per cent on incomes between
$12,000 and $14,000, up to a maxi
mum of 44 per cent on incomes ex
ceeding $92,000. Exemption of $2,000
for single persons and $3,000 for
heads of families.

Substantially all of the ballots ob
tainable in the Texas senatorial
election contest have arrived in
Washington where they are under
lock and key and are being guarded
day and night by three guardsmen,
hired and paid by the United States
senate. These guards work eight
hours to a shift and they are armed

the rooms where the ballots are
kept except the guard while on
duty.

COURT ACTION IN OIL
CASES TO START SOON
Attorneys Pomerene and Roberts
Confirmed by Senate to
Prosecute
(Bureau of Publication and education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 19.
Now that the senate has confirmed
both Atlee Pomerene, of Ohio, and
Owen J. Roberts, of Philadelphia, as
attorneys for the government in the
prosecution of the noted oil cases,
injunctions will be filed as quickly
as possible to retain the Doheny in
terests and the Sinclair interests
from extracting any further oil from
the leased areas in Teapot Dome and
Elk Hills reserves, it is announced.
After a conference with President
Coolidge the attorneys said: “We are
going to move swiftly in this matter,
but with the proper amount of cau
tion. Whatever we do, we want to be
as near uncriticizable as possible.
The biggest task ahead of us is to
sift through the immense amount of
evidence adducted to the Senate in

going to take some time.”

Teapot Dome Scandal Out-
Shines All With Sensa

BORAH PLAYS WITH RE
Wets Would Have Anti-Saloon
League Probed as “Pernicious
Political Machine”
(Bureau .f Publication and Education)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 19 !l
hverything in Washington nowadays
is investigation after investigation.
Ix>oks like we had turned into a gov
ernment by investigation. No less
than 30 formal investigations by
standing or special committees have
been asked so far this session of con
gress and the end is not yet in sight.
The Teapot Dome investigation has
them all beaten so far as to sensa
tional disclosures but there are oth
ers brewing that promise as big
sensations when things get going, so
it is predicted. The investigation of
the Veterans’ Bureau will reveal a
lot of sorry stuff and abuse of power
if it ever comes out in open congress
like it is expetced to.
Committees Busy.
Secretary Denby is now out of the
cabinet or at least he is going out
and now the Democrats and insurg
ents are after Attorney General
Daugherty. His scalp is now de
manded. Senator Borah is digging
into Russian propaganda in our
country. Senator Copeland is inves
tigating the alleged fake diploma
mills. Senator Reed, of Missouri, is
investigating the Bok peace plan.
The j investigation of Senator May
field’s election to the senate from
Texas is now under way and Senator
Heflin has gotten under way his in
vestigation of the alleged Texas
land frauds
Over in the house end of the Capi
tol the lower branch of congress too
has caught the fever to investigate
things. Fully 20 investigation have
been sought in that body. Liquor
seems to be a favorite topic of in
quiry in the house.
Idle Six Years.
Representative Blanton, of Texas,
wants to call together the house
committee on alcoholic liquors; this
committee is said to never have held
a meeting during its six years of ex
istence. Blanton wants to probe the
reports thal high government offi
cials in Washington are customers
of the bootlegging fraternity. Repre
sentative Hill, of Maryland, would
have a committee dig into alleged
scandals in the U. S. Prohibition bu
reau. Representative Tinkham of
Massachusetts, another pronounced
wet member, would investigate the
Anti-Saloon League of America as a
pernicious political influence.
Representative Jeffers, of Alabama,
wants to probe certain income tax
funds made by the treasury depart
ment. Representative Carter, of Ok
lahoma, would pry into the alleged
wholesale swindling of Indians in his
state. And Representative Bloom, of
New York, would investigate the the
ater ticket speculators throughout
the country.
