In locked lip both night and day,
And when ma wants to open it
She send» 1110 ont. to play.
I stole a peep one afternoon,
AItlioiij^h it wim not light ;
But, oil ! the little tilings I saw
Were such » pretty sight.
Tli« cutest, nicest little dollies,
Just, bijf enough for doll—
Ibit then I knew they're not, for her—
She needs them not, at a'l.

"Have yon got the nomination,:'
Squills, dear?" . '
I knew fcllO had seen the evening

mildly as if convention« und

Hiiares were beneath my notice.
"Not got the nomination, Ml',

"What fellows' throats !"
"Your friends who have been
trampling in and out of my house,
Mr. Squills, and borrowing yonr
poor children's money, and running
you in all kinds of disreputable
places to hunt up votes, and sneak
ing you off Into the country to bar
becues ftnd other infamous resorts,
paying for buggies atul making
ridiculous remarks which I know
you paid the reporters to work np
into a, speech. A nice tiling you
have done for yourself ami me, and
the poor children, and then, after
nil, not to get anything for your
pains. I'm ashamed of you, Mr.
Squills; I would blush for you, but
I can't, and what's more, I won't.
"Don't tell me Squills, that you
don't want me to blush for you, ami
you sitting there just as mad as a ;
iiatful of hornets. After telling me;

too, and the dear child, that slu
hhould have anew silk dress when,
you got the nomination you've
und those fellows who took ;
money ami whiskey, just, laughing
at you. and thinking what a fnoi
you arc tor believing them. That's
what hurts nie in the tenderest
point, Stjuills."
I put out tho light, and tumbled
into bed, and prepared to go lu
Bleep, but Mrs Squills stil! kept at i
it with a forty-Ä'quills power.
After a time exhausted nature
gave way, and she was silent.
Then I felt a certain riggling of
the lied, and 1 turned round and
naid :
"Mrs. Squills, is that, you?!
What in the world are yon doing;
that for ? If you want to laugh,]
laugh, and don't shako as it you
bad the buck ague.
Oh, wliat a politician you aie,
Squills!" said she. "Two weeks
canvassing, and then to be shunk
ed by a tadpole !"
"To keep peace in the family,"'j
said Squills ! "I had to promise;
that dress, or honiething else.
ami
for the tadpole business, what car.
you explain to a woman."
