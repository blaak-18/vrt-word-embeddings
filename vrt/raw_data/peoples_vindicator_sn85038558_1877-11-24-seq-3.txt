One of the most popunlari offlee men
k ever in the Grand Ecoi-e trade holds the
g reins in the business department of the
iBart Able. It is not flattering to say
e- that C8pt. George Hamilton is in every
way worthy the unlimited confidence
u- reposed in him by the entire business
le community of the trade. Honest to a
a- Mult; closely attentive to all matters
re intrusted to his care, polite and a thor
et ough gentleman, are qualities which
have rendered him deservedly popular.
SHe is the commission merchant for hun
Sdreds hr small farmers along the river;
in sells their cotton and buys their goods,
bf and that too Without charge; while he
er is the banker of the whole arniy of cot
ton buyers in the towns along the river,
bringing them hundreds of thousands of
Sdollars every season. If the Grand
le Ecore trade wete to lose Hamilton, it
would be Seriots to contemplate, ahd we
er hope he will long retnain among friends
is who know his worth and appreciate it.
