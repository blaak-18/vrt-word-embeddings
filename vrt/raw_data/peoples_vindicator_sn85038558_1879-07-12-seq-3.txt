The Pollee Jury has passed a war or

A Collation Robbed.
The Rev. Walters of the Methodist
Colored Episeopal Church reported to us
this week that during the last night of
his collation at Lacoste's Hall, some
young men of the African persuasion,
instigated by his Satanic Majesty blew
out the lights in the hall, robbed him of
wines, siests, ete., and made their escape. I1
lie says, being a stranger bhere, he doesn't a
know who the parties are, but thinks i
thoeegh he will be able to have them ar- P
rested. We hope he may.
Crop,
The weather for the past week has T
been good for cotton.
We have been atnfeued that in some ft
localities in this parish the cotton boll1
is fully developed, open and ready for
plekig,. No caterpillars have an yet
apeared in this parish, and farmers
are ubilant over thei cotto prospect.
Some of our planters will commence
picking about the lt of August. The
stand is good and the yield will be pleao
tiful.
The farmers on Spanish lake are jobi- 0
ant over the heavy showers they re
elived on the 3d instant, and the result ti
will he that they will reap a rich harvest

general interest thallt hardly anythlng
else is talked altml. It is the snicidle
tof Mr. Jewl Scudder, a rich tfarmer,
connected with somll of tlie oldest
and best people of t he islahed. T'le
eircumetnraces attending his death are
of a peculiar nature and not without
din cle-leite.' of relanolce.
Abeut five yeas ;ago old Mr. Israel
-Scudder died.l leaving a largep proper
tv to be divided between six children.
Two of the girls were married, but
the three hbrs were baehelors. Joel
and George Scudder h tght ot ot the
olther heirs, and for somea years the
homlestead faram, and prodluctive ne,
was run in p,artnership. After a while,
however, Joel bought out his brother
anid took upin himself the entire
management of the estate. The tin
married sister, Delia, lived with hliu
and kept house. George also resided
with him. After a while there were
runmors of occasional family misun
derstandings, and some time ago
Wallionu build a new house, intoe
lwhichl' (some lime in July) le was to
have moved with his saster and brotlih
et George, leaving Joel alone. The
latter Iwealne melancholy and coin
plaiied bitteily of Isis intended de
.ertion. It waesommronly whispered,
however, among his neighbors that he
would not be long alone, as he was
paying marked attention to the.
,laughter of a prominent resident eof
Cold Springs. This was the state of,
,lfairn on Sunday afternoon when
Joel went to his stab;es, and select.
ieg his favorite horse drove away in
a buggy to Cold Spring. There he 1
visited 1eis married sister, and after
ward the lady to whom gossip hadl,
reported him engaged.
He had told lhis brother when lear.
ing that he wonld not be back till
late. 'Ihe family were therefore
somewhat ansprised when he returned
at is e.'clck. Putting his horse itn
tle stable, lie went slewly up the
brick walk to his honuse and, entering ,
the dining roem.l found his sister sit.
tihug near the table, supper beiang
over. She said, "Joel, we have bad
,n, tea to.night ; it we varm, so we
did not put the kettle on." He toe
plied, "Oh, that is nothing; I don't ,
care for any." He then walked to
Ihe table and took from it a piece of
cake, which lie ate, and afterward a
drank a glass of water.
TUI BOOTING.
Miss Della then whent up stairs to a
her brotlher Genege. Before she went,
huo ever, she saw Joel go to a closet i
and took out a very handsome double t
barrelled breacbhloading gun and
play with it a. moment. He also took
aot a large dri box of eatridges. She
had been up stairs but a moment
when both she and her brother beard t
the report of the gon. They eharried
down, and, not finding Joel ladeors, e
hastened to the back of the house, I
where they discovered him lying up a
on hias side quite dead. He had plae
ed the bmrrel to his right temple, and
with the cleaning stick of the guns
pressed the trigger. The cartridge
was a large one and the entire top oft
his bead was blown off. T brainsi
were scattered for six feet ashnd and
piese of the skull were thrown up
fully thirty fee' agalust the wall of
the house. Pbhyaciaso were at ones

ounfortunate mn had not moved st
ter the lst sheek. He was lying
peaetaully on his left side, his feet
croraeed, and bl ftee, as far am could
be told, bearting not a trace of pain.
His body was horse to his rsidence,
and Judge Rolph, in tihe habsence of
the Coroner, immediately impanmel.
led a jury. After ezamiinga a few
witnenes a verdclet of suieide was
rendered. The aftair has eaned tice
deepe rerent tbrougloau the Mor

was widely known and uilversully
repeeted. Penm the fact that short
ly befoae he shot himselfhe had made
arrangerents to btorrow a hoerse for
use ,m his farm to-day it i lferred

the last moment. He died' lteiate,
and the property which he ha s a
quired by prehase froem the heirs of
his father's estate will now return to"

The lady to whom the unhappy
man was prayoing his addresses is tihe
eldest daughter of Mr. Joseph Bnuffet,
living about three miles from Mr.
Scedder'a farm. She is a comely
woman, perhaps tweaotyve years
old. 8he was greatly alhocked by the
news of her suitor's rush ct. In
aeply to the qunesticans d a Herald re
