CHASING ROBBERS.
It Is Reported They Are Surrounded on
People's Creek Near Helena.
Helena, Mont., July 12 - Reports
have reached here that the Great North
ern express robbers have been surround
ed on Peoples creek, south of the Little
Rockies, with seven men guarding them
awaiting the arrival of Sheriff Griffith,
who is on his way with a posse of 40
men. It is known the robbers crossed
the Missouri river not far from Peck
Agency, Mont,, on Monday evening
and that they were riding fresh horses
secured either from relays provided in
advance or by theft from the ranges
which they passed. From the vicinity
of Belknap Agency they headed south
and are in a section- of country where
they can make good time. This inform
ation indicates the robbers have some
other haven in sight than the "Hole in
the Wall country. having gotten far
east of that section.
Sheriff Benner of Great Falls, has
also organized a posse to assist Sheriff
Griffith.

In i1.:: the craze was at its height.
Tournomtents were held throughout the
country, and the people seemed banjo
mad. Charles E. Dobson issued a
"challenge to any player In the worlI
to compete with him in plaking for a
$t4he gold medal." Steinway hall was
padeig l to its doors to see him defeat
eight candidatess with the redoubtable
Horace eeston at their head, and the
next d iy the papers gave the perform
ance columnus.
With the original Spanish Students
who appeared at Booth's theater came
the mandolin, and its tremulous tinkle
marked the first Jangle of the baijo's
deatelknell. The Students made a
tour through the country' and the first
wedge to knock out the banjo had been
driven in. And, alas, where is the ban
jo now ?
The career of George Dobson as a
banjo player is full of pathos, for it is
the general history of the rise and fall
of a very picturesque instrument. If not

Carnegie'. Reward of Pluck.
I Starting in a smuall way 13 years ago,
Seattle began building up a public li
brary. It was moved fromn plac. to
place as it grew until on the night of
Jan. 1. 1901. it was destroyed by tire.
The next morning the library commis
sion telegraphed to Andr-ew Carnegie.
They asked for $200.000. Mr. Carnegie
answered: "Atlanta has more popula- i
tion. I gave her $123.000." They an
swered: "Increase population 1890-1900: º
Atlanta. 37 per cent; Seattle, 88. Se- I

A Juvenile Gemins.
A little Russian girl named Tyna r
Helman beceme a pupil in the Wells
Grammar school of Boston last at.tumn.
She did not know a word of English,
but she could speak a little French and
Spanish and her own native tongue
fluently. She was placed In the- lowest
grade in the school, but in a few weeks
her teacher thought that she would b
probably gain more in the next higher e
grade. This was repeated until the
principal advanced her to the highest
class in the school. When it camine time
for the last examination and the Ii

Giant.' Kettles.
In the Interstate park, near Taylor's
Fields, Minn., has been discovered a
singular group of "giants' kettles" or
potholes, covering ani area of two or
three acres and ranging in diameter
from less than a foot to 23 feet and in t
depth from a foot to 84 feet. Thee
have been bored in exceedingly hard Si
rock, and in many cases they are like T
wells in shape, the ratio of width to
depth varying from one to five up to to
Dne to seven. (C

There, too, was Mrs. R'oman's
Righter, now happily passed away.
She went in for woman suffrage. for
the higher education of her sex. pra -
tically also for their emancipation from
domestic cares, for she made her uf-
band do the housework. She heeroredi
and henpecked him Into an early
grave, yet to the day of his death he
was her devoted slave. She made wa-
man's rights' spee-"hes, in which she
abused the tyrant and monster man
till not even he could recognize hbIn
self. Now. the wise woman who wants
to get her legal and civil rights froths
wen will not abuse them for erev
thing that is bad, will she? Rather
will she "jolly" them a bit. Mrs. We
man's Righter made herself so offen
sive to the masculine sex that by the
score she turned them against the'
cause. Instead of building up the
beautiful temple of liberty for woman,.
she merely scored men. When she
was buried, there was not a man at
her funeral as a mourner, not even
her sons-in-latw. who might have been
expected to be present on the occasion
with espeeial zest. `o the masculine
sex got Ceen with her at last.
