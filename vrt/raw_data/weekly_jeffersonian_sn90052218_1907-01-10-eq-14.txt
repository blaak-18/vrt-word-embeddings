SENATOR CULBERSON ON THE
NEGRO AND THE SOUTH.
(Continued from page 5.)
certain Texans and had reflected
particularly upon Capt. McDonald,
the Ohio Senator said he did not
know what McDonald resented, un
less it was the term “gentleman.”
Mr. Foraker read from the Cin
cinnati Enquirer an account of Capt.
McDonald’s resentment, commenting
freely as he progressed. Among
other things Senator Foraker said:
“I don’t know why Capt. McDon
ald would charge 4 hell with one
bucket of water’ unless it was that
he had no other use for the water.”
Again after reading the statement
of McDonald that he was willing to
meet Foraker, but did not inted to
make trouble for him, the Ohio Sen
ator exclaimed: “What a relief that
is to me.”
Another account, taken from the
Houston Post, pictured Capt. Mc-
Donald as a great “man killer” in
the cause of justice, and told of the
manner in which McDonald had con
ducted his investigation of the
Brownsville affair at the request of
the governor of Texas. Mr. Foraker
concluded his remarks by putting the
interviews in the record and asking
for a vote on the resolution.
Senator Culberson replied briefly
by saying the country was to be fe
licitated on the fact that the Ohio
Senator had turned his attention to
derision of a captain of Texas rang
ers.
Captain on the Spot.
“There is,’’ he said, “one thing
I ought to add to what I have said
about Capt. McDonald in view of the
wish expressed in this chamber a few
days ago to meet him, but which has
bcfcn omitted from the record. It
affords me very great pleasure to say
in the same spirit that he never de
clined an invitation of that character
in all his life, and he is too old to
change his habits now.”
An amendment was offered by (Sen
ator Ixnlge to confine the inquiry by
the committee on military affairs to
a qustion of fact in regard to the
conduct of the negro soldiers, in that
it recognized that the order was is
sued by the president “in the exer
cise of his constitutional authority
as commander in chief.” This
would have the effect of preventing
an investigation of the constitutional
questions involved in the president’s
order dismissing the troops.
