of plenty lavished her gifts upon
him, his charities were numerous,

A bareclue and basket picnic is
spoken of for Sunday, Sept. 8th.
The I<rnludta nine will cross bats

is requested to contribute some
thing, those contributing sharing
the nice dinner. All visiting guests
will be provided for, and the town
residents are not expected to par
ticipate unless they contribute.
While wewe are rot rushed is the
timen to bring in your orders for

Ie too busy to attend to you. Pri
ces on application.
The Populist picenic and public
speaking at Robeline, on Wednes
day, August 25th, was a grand
success. At least five hundred
citizens of this and other parishes
were present. Addresses were de
livered by lion. J. M. Perdue, of
Texas, and G. W. Bruce, of Rap
ides. The audience was highly en
tertained and edified thereby, as
we are satisfied that the speeches
were interesting.
The refreshment stants yielded
sufficient revenue to defray all ex
penses of the meeting. Those
forts of the Enterprise to belittle
the meeting by saying that only a
hundred and fifty persons were
present. The many Populists of
Robeline and vicinity deserve cred
it for making the meeting a suc
cess, and other sections should
profit by t he' good example.
HENRYVILLE, LA.,

Editors Populist :
As Henryville isibooming, will
drop you a few dots from here.
Mr. Henry Rachal, of Proven
cal, will open a store with Mr.
Will Cockfield as manager, and
will treat all his Democratic friends
on opening day; if he treated his
Populist friends he would go broke,
as they are too numerous.
some good Populist should see
friend Jno. H. Henry, as he is dis
ttation, and would make as good a
"Pop" as he is a merehant.
