now renders unnecessary. Women need no cln,_r sufffc" for mode.,!y's sake. Wine of Cardlii bringc
relief to modest women in the privacy of their homes. Many of the best home; in t;is city arec never
without this great medicine. It cures "whites" and falling of the womb and completcly eradicates these
draqging. periodical pains. Mrs. Davis' cure sho-ws you conclusively what you may expect if you follow
her example and take Wine of Cardui. Thedford's Black-Draught aids Wine of Cardui by r:.r',iatin; the
stomach and bowels. When you ask your druggist for these medicines, be sure you get thenp, It was
Wine of Cardui and Thedford's Black-Draught that saved Mrs. Davis' life. Never take a tubsttute.

of "G;raustark." lately published by
Herbert S. Stotne & Co. of this city,
was born in Indiana and Is another of
the young Hloosiers who are making
that state fatuous in letters. He is a
journalist. Tie began as a reporter in
889. and four years later he became
city editor of the Lafayette Morning
Journal, a position which he still holds.
For three months in his early youth he
tried to be an actor, but during his
walk home after this experience he
was cured of that ambition.
