T~E PFOIRTH OF JLULY,
the gratefult Germans some years ago
erected a beautiful st-tue in memory of
their deliverer, Arminius, who now stands in
bronze facing the Rhine as he always did
when the legions of Rome were about to in
lade the marches and forests of the old
fatherland. True, they have not been
blessed with a free and Republican govern
ment as we have, but the liberty-loving
'feutons, as their descendants now do, held
their savior dear in memory and their bards
still sing of "the deeds he did, the fields he.
won, the freedom he restored." The
conqueror of Varus is now the national
hero; the superstitious Teutons worshiped
him, and their descendants now honor him.
-'t" he French have not to go back as far
as the first century to find the (late of their
delivery. The bright sons and daughters of
Sunny France sing that grand Ihymn, "La
Marseillaise," and when all the nations of the
earth will enjoy the benign influence of
)Democratic government, they will join them
in celebrating the Fourteenth of July as one
of the red letter days in tile history of re
ptqblic-n achievements.
When we see the Germans, who do not
enjoy our privileges, commemnorate what
they regard as the beginning of their free
dom, how nluch more right have we to
remember in a proper way the date which
marks the transfer of sovereignty from the
mother country into the hands of our an
cestors ?
Just one hundred and twenty-one years
ago the measure known as the D)eclaration
of Independence, drafted by Thomas
Jefferson, was proclaimed to the
country by Congress assembled. In
this age of sweet girl graduates it would
be useless to recount "the folly of England
and the ruin of America" during the years
preceding the revolution when England so
wantonly trampled, upon the rights and liber
ties of the colonies; but we cannot but
touch upon the fact with pride that we, of
the South, tyok the first pronounced step
toward achieving the independence of the
colonies. The Carolinas and Virgins were
the first to pass formal resolutions virtually
declaring themselves independent, and it
was Richard lHenry Lee, ,f Virginia, who
iamoved inl the Conltin;ental Congress "That
these Unitted States are anti ought to ie free
and independent States, and that all polit
ical connection between tlhem anli the State
of Great litain is and ought to be dis
solved." \Ve should necver forget the fact
that the South was the first to declare our
inldependence, and that it was the voice of
I'atri:k hlenry of Virginia that defended
,with all eloquence almost unparalleled, the
resolutions formally proclaiming a defiance.
True, that declaration did not accomplish
our indclenidticec, but the first step w'as
takenl anl from that time we see the strug
gle for liemlocratic institutions. Independ
ence from England was soon obtained, but
the most critic.tl pei iod of American history
is when the two parties that dii ided America
at that time represent-ed bI Jefferson ai:d
lamniilton, fought out a principle -Jefferson
the dreamier and l[amilton the fultiller.
That same principle has again an.l again
been brought before the American public
Jefferson was the father of that declaration
and the principles it emboidied are his, those
which Ilamilton oplposed in part. IIlanilton
opposed the tyranny of England anl Jeffer
son the principle of a monarchy. Ifa:nilton
wishedt to take British insititutions as a
model, but Jefferson espo,:lsed the principles
of Sydny and John L.ocke, and when he
promulgated that famous document it
startled the worldl-a defiance, coming as it
did, from a colony to the mother country,
and now the liberty-loving people of tihe
carth still delight in it as an assertion of the
rights of man.
]But Jefferson was a dreamer, they say.
Yes, and lie dreamed out this sacred paper;
he dreamed out the principles of the grand
old I cnmocratic party; lie dreamed out the
purttchase of .ouisiana; hle dreamed out the
abolition of slavery, the extension of our
territory, the repulblic.
Hamilton simply wished to free himself
from foreign dictation; he cared not what
form of government the colonies would as
sume, but Jefferson had embraced the new
philosophy of the rights of man, the beauti
ful pritnciple of human liberty.
That precious paper which Jefferson has
bequeathed to us is a supreme trust. Since
thie Civil war there is a tendency to drift
gradually from the principles of Jefferson.
"The decisions of the Supreme Cottrt have
favored IIamiltonianism, and there is ample
reason for our Democratic leaders to go
S)to Thomas Jefferson for the true theory
ofour government. They will find in him
decentralizatiorn, Democracy and toleration
in religion. Chaste as Washington, just as
John lMarshall, he stands the greatest of
them all, the '-Great Commoner."
And now when all over this glorious repub
lic liberty bells are sendiAg forth glad tidings
of renewed prosperity, we should in our
joy. extend our sympathy to the struggling
mLubans. Whatever be their stretgth, they
are rebels against the tyranny of a mnlot
archy and WVashington has made that term
sacued. And it may seem a decree of fate
that Jefferson, whom we honor to-day, said:
"'Erect a column on the southernmost
limit of that island and inscribe on it 're
lus reltra,' We shall- thetn have only to
include the North in our Union, and we
shall have such an empire for Liberty as she
has never surveyed since the creation."
And may his last dream be fulfilled.
Th¢e Ladies' Club.
On Thursday afternoon the L. F.
O. T. Club held a pleasant meeting
at the pretty home of Mrs. A. C.
Young. Miss Adele Young, in a
graceful manner, received each
guest, all of whom were made to
feel very welcome to the hospitality
dispensed. Business transactions
being over with all with one accord
repaired to the lovely dining-hall,
where a beautiful sight presented
itself-dainty vases filled with fra
grant blossoms told of arrangement
by tasty fingers, doiliec and centre
pieces, whose jewel-nock bespoke
an adept at fancy work. Pineapple
and chocolate cream, cakes of all
kinds and tempting cream puffs
made up the menu.
The contents of "The Mystic
Box" provoked much guessing, and
much merry laughter accompanied
some of the "guesses." Finally
Mrs. Darling guessed correctly- a
lace pin-and was also awarded the
prize, a pretty fancy duster. In
strumental music by Miss Cornay,
solos by Mrs. Biossat and Miss
Mudd added to the pleasure of the
afternoon.
Mrs. Bourdier was greeted as a
welcomed guest on this occasion.
One of the most impressive and
beautiful religious services held in
I.&fayette was the mass said at the
Cathclic church Wednesday morn
ing for the repose of the soul of the
late Archbishop Janssens. The
church had been very tastily deco
rated for the occasion by Messrs.
H. Vandercruyssen and Pierre
Gerac, who certainly displayed a
thorough knowledge of the decora
tive art. The following visiting
priests assisted Revs. Forge and
lioulard: Revs. Branche of
IRayne, Guens of Crowley,
Pecters of Jennings, Langlois of
St. Martinville, Malluchet of Port
Barre. Messrs. T. P. Caillouet
and I lenry Gerac acted as ushers
andt did all in their power to seat
everybody.
Tl'he members of the local lodge
of Catholic Knights attended the
services in a body. They were
seated along the aisle where chairs
were placed for them.
Father Malluchet preached a very
touching eulogy on the life of the
lamented prelate.
The Assessltlents.
Last week a few errors crept into
our article about the assessments.
It was stated that an increase of
Stxx,ooo had been made on the
property of the Carencro Sugar
Manufacturing Company. Eight
thousand dollars is the correct
amount.
The assessment of the Lafayette
Sugar Manufacturing Company last
year was $6, ooo instead of $4,500.
This year it is fixed at $15,ooo and
not $S,ooo as stated last week.
We stated that the probable as
sessments of Martial Billaud's prop
erty would reach $37,000. It will
be about $32,000. Last year it
was $19,1 25.
The People's Cotton Oil Mill was
assessed at $1o,ooo.
The 1st National Bank last year
was booked for $18,448. This year
it is $27,000.
Married.
One of Lafayette's popular young
men, Mr. Pierre Landry, son of Hon.
R. C. Landry, was married Thurs
day evening to Miss Idea Landry,
a most charming young lady of
Iberia parish. The marriage took
place at the residence of the bride's
father, Mr. Alphonse Landry, near
New Iberia, in the presence of a
large number of friends and rela
tives. The bridesmaid was Miss
Elodie Landry and the groomsman
Mr. Luciern Bonin. A splendid
collation was served after fhe cele
bration of the nuptial rites.
Mr. and Mrs. Landry left on the
night train for New Orleans. Af
ter a short stay in that city they
went to Biloxi, where they will
spend a couple of weeks, after
which they will return to this parish
to reside permanently.
Adolphe Clotier and Miss Fannie
Iechro were the guests of Mr. A.
R. Lisbony's family this week.

formance will be given at Flag
Town.
Our parish assessor seems to be
"up to snuff " and we trust that he
will go on still further with his
good work, and see that some of
our land barons contribute in pro
portion to their holdings, as com
pared with that of the smaller prop
erty holder. If politics, friendship
and locality is lost sight of, or ig

a reduction of taxes.
The Carcncro Union Ginning
Company is giving their gin a gen

ity of some forty-eight bales.
Judging from the number of
agents appointed and the number of
firms that will compete for the pur
chase of cotton and cotton-seed in
Carencro the coming season, this
should Tprove a splendid market for
those who have either to sell.
We were pleased to greet Masters

was brilliant with lights and was
covered with a mass of tube roses
and jessamines, while upon it re
posed the mitre and baretta, golden
chalice and other symbols of the
rank of the dead prelate. A very
large congregation assisted at the
ceremonies and thus testified their
esteem and loving remembratice of
the beloved dead, who was, and is
conceded by all, a priest among
priests, a man among men, a chris
tian among christians, and by far
the riost superior archbishop the
diocese of Louisiana has ever had.

succeed in giving a very good enter
tainment. The good sisters have
been a source of much Improve
ment to our children, since their
arrival five months ago, and as
their convent building is still defi

their convenience, it is pretty sure
that the generous people of Caren

the small admission fee charged.

To the I.afayctte Gazette:
A very quiet and interesting game
of base ball was played last Sunday
in the 7th ward by the Fourcade
and Meaux clubs. The score was
37 to 23 in favor of the latter.
The game was hotly contested, but
the Fourcades were not in it at all,
and it is safe to say that whenever
they will tackle the Meaux Club
they will meet a similar fate.
The Meaux Club will play the
Abbeville boys at Darmas Brous
sard's on the 3rd of July.
RuRAi. S owr.
Aby Demanade, the young son of
Mr. Felix Demanade, returned
home a few clays ago carrying with
him a diploma as a reward for faith
ful application to his studies at the
well-known Classical and Commer
cial Institute of Prof. I-. S. Chenet
at New Orleans. Aby speaks in
glowing terms of Mr. Chenet's
school and is anxious to furnish
any one with information concern
ing it.
Prof. Chenet is a native of Louis
iana and is a graduate of the State
University and A. & M. College.
He is not only a teacher of much
skill, but he is a gentleman of great
administrative ability, as is evi
denced by the success and growing
popularity of Chenet's Institute.
He is assisted by a very able faculty
and the curriculum is thorough and
complete in every particular and in
accord with the most advanced
methods of teaching.
The Lumber Dealers.
A number of gentlemen com
posing the Louisiana Lumber
Dealers' Association, held a meet

elected the following officers to
serve during the ensuing year:
presiden:, T. L. Lewis, of Welch;
vice-president, A. E. Mouton, of
Lafayette; secretary and treasdrer,
J. T. Callahan, of Washington.
Chicago excells in many things.
The pedal extremities of its women
are said to be hideously large, and
in many other respects the great
city of hogs is aheat of Lafayette,
but the Chicago lawyers, to whomi
Mr. Ferguson was referred, were
evidently not acquainted with the
constitution of Louisiana.
Rev. Root. Howvell, - from
Cheniere, was in L.afa-ctte this
week.
THEY ARE ALRIGHT
Savs the Supreme Coturt-The ~Mu-i,
nicipal Bonds Declared Con
stitutional
And Lafayette Will Soon Have
Waterworks and Electric
Lights.
The Supreme Court has rendered
its decision in the case involving
the legality of the bonds proposed
to be issued by the authorities of
this town for the erection of water
works and electric light plants.
The way this question was forced
into the courts happened in the fol
lowing manner:
Mr. J. M. Ferguson had entered
into a contract to build the im
provements contemplated for thirty
six thousand dollars payable in
bonds to be issued by the town,
provided their issuance be author
ized by the Legislature. The City
Council, then in pcwer, secured at
some expense, the services of Mr.
Crow Girard to go to Baton Rouge
and press the bill to a final passage
by the Legislature which was then
in session. The passage of the act
being accomplished, Mr. Ferguson
desiring to realize on the bonds that
he proposed to accept, went to Chi
cago for that purpose. Of course,
he believed, as well as the town au
thorities, that the bonds would be
perfectly legal obligations of the
town, but .before he could obtain
even a consideration of his propo
sition to negotiate the bonds he had
to obtain a written opinion of a
firm of leading corporation lawyers
of Chicago upon their legality.
The opinion of these corporation
attorneys was that for various rea
sons the bonds were illegal and un
constitutional. The result was that
Mr. Ferguson had to either forfeit
his $500 deposited with the City
Council as a penalty in case he
failed to carry out his part of the
contract, (in that event the town
would get the $500, but no improve
ments) or make a test case of the
question before the courts. We
say test case advisedly, because the
question presented had never been
decided in this State.
In order to bring about a decision
the City Council passed an ordi
nance directing the mayor to sign
and issue the bonds under
the contract. This ordinance
as was previously understood,
the mayor promptly vetoed for the
reasons stated by the Chicago law
yers. The Council, however, im
mediately passed the ordinance over
the mayor's veto, but he still re
fused to sign the bonds. All this
appeared in the proceedings of the
Council. dMr. Ferguson then im
mediately filed proceedings in ihe
district court to compel Mr. Caffery
to sign the bonds. To this demand,
Mr. Caffery, in order to carry out
the plan, answered that the act of
the Legislature authorizing the is
suance of the bonds, was unconsti
tution and illegal, and hence he
could not be forced to commit an
illegal act.
Judge Debaillon, without passing
upon the question raised by the
mayor, decided that having no in
terest individually he could not re
fuse to sign the ordinance, when the
contractor was waiting to accept
the bonds in payment for his work,
and ordered him to forthwith sign
and issue the bonds to the con
tractor. And there the case stood.
Mr. Ferguson could get the bonds
signed, but their legahty yet re
mained a question undecided. He
was certainly in no better, if not in
a~ worse, position. Necessarily the
case had to be carried to a higher
court to obtain, if possible, a de
cistork on the question of their con
stitutionality and legality. The
Council could not mnora,// exact the
acceptance of its obhgations in
layncnt vhtln their legality was sr
riously luestionel andt in ./,jr //
keep the $0oo of thie contractor,
who was in vain doing all in his
power, at large expense, to obtain
a decision of the question.
Anxious to secure a decision and
thereby obtain the erection of the
proposed plants, should he secure a
final and favorable decision, the
mayor appealed to the Supreme
Court and that tribunal has de
cided the question as presnted by
the parties, and maintained the act
of the Legislature authorizing the
issuance of bonds legal and consti
tutional.
We have given the foregoing his'
tory of this case that the people
should know the serious obstacles
and great trouble the old Council
had to overcome to bring about the
will expressed at the ballot by the
tax-payers of the town,
The very satisfactory outcome of
the whole thing is a signal Victory
for Mayor Caffery and the old
Council.
Lafayette will now have water
works and electric lights. We are
informed that Contractor Ferguson
will begin to work at an early day
and that no time will be lost, and
our little city will be in the lead in
matters of public improvements,
