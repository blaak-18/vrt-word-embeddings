The lappy Hour.
The busy day is over,
The honsehold work is done,
The cares that fret the morning
Have 1'ded with the sun;
And in tender twilight
I sit in happy rest,
With my darling little baby
Asleep upon my breast.
White lids, with silken fringes,
Shut out the walinug light;
A little hand close folded
Holds mammas's fingers tight;
And in their soft, white wrappings,
At last in perfect rest,
Two daiunty feet are cuddled
Like birdies in a nest.
All thonught and love unworthy
Nepar' at this sweet hour;
All true and noble longings
Renew their holy power,;
Pot Christ, wio lt,*i Vi~in
Our motherhood has blest,
Is near to every woman
With a baby on her breast.
Hbw Mr rMimpbleuf Kept House
"Not much to do, did you say, my i
dear t" remarked Mrs. Mimpblen. c
pausing before her liege lord, and f
gazing at him indignantly.
"Yes," growled the gentleman;
"it's a mystery to me what women
have to grumble about; especially y
you, my love, with a small house, 8
and only four children to attend to. F
Whereais, we men have an intolera- v
ble burden resting upon our should- a
era, and when we return weary and
perplexed to our homes, expecting to h
find rest and quiet, we are greeted e
with the old, old story--'so much to a
do-tired to denth--children so trou- s
some'-and a thousand other com
plaints."
Mrs. Mimpblenf turned away to li
hide the two pearly tears which rose i
to her large blue eyes and rolled slow- t4
ly down the fair round cheeks, and s
made no reply ; while her husband n
lighted Lis cigar and walked leisure- tl
ly up to his office.
He was somewhat astonished at a
noon by his wife's announcing her in- tI
tention of leaving the house in his 0
care, and accepting an invitation to g
spend a few weeks with her cousin in f
the country. i
"You need a- little rest Jeremiah,
and while I am gone you can close c
your office and stay at home, and t4
and have a nice easy time, with only t1
a few hnsehold duties to attend to," c
declired Bellina, kindly.
Mr. Jeremiah Elijah Mimpblenf h
scowled. e
"Do you mean to say that I am to a
devote my whole attention to house- p
hold matters t Why, madam, I can
easily do what little there is to be
,done, aud-soeeJ aey -neiineessleo." ti
"But the children !" suggested his h
wife. n
'-You will take them with you, of o
course," lihe replied, indifferently. I
"Oh, no! I could't be bothered it
with them," answered Bellina, stiffly."
Mr. Mimpbleuf looked somewhat c
blank at her declaration, but noticing ii
the least perceptible twinkle in her ji
eyes, lie hastened to say:
"Very well, leave them at home ;
four childrep are nothing to look af t
ter, and I shall manage beautifully." t
"Now,' thought our hero, the morn- f<
ing of his wife's departure, "I'll be- d
gin by, straighltening up the dining
room and washing the dishes." n
Two plates, one saucer, and the a
china tea urn were broken in clearing v
off the takle ; but be was not dicour- t
aged, and congratulated himself that I
it was no worse, The fire had gone t
out in the kitchen stove? so that he t
was obliged to use cold watek for
washing the dishes, which only liar- c
dened the grease without removing t
it, and he was in a quandary; for a
Jeremiah was a very fastidious per- v
son, and abhorred a plate that was i
not perfectly cleanh So he rubbed t
and rubbed, but with no success; and I
to make matters more serious- lhe
found himself completely dreniched in I
greasy waters His handsome dres- I
sing-gown was ruined, and his new 1
embroidered slippers wet and soiled.
He built a rousing fire at noon, and;
put the meat directly over it to broil n
the lie rummaged arodnd for half an I
hour to find a cook book, and after ac
complislhing this feat, lie joyfully an-' I
nounced his intention of having bis
cults for dinners . He accordingly got I
all the tinware out upon the table, i
and stcceedled in dirtying some half
dozen pans, three cups, and sis or 1
eight spi0Ds. When they were at
last made, lie referred once more to
the cook-book.
"It abys, 'bake in ar 'quick oven,' "
mused Mr. impbleaf; "I wonder if
ours is a 'quick oven, t' I guess it is,
for Bellina always Ihas irst-rate bis
caits, so here they go," and lie shoved
in the pan.
A flame suddenly bust out all
•around the gtridirons and, after re
moving it, he found that after get
ting well smoked, the meat had burn
dI to a crisp oh thie side neat the fire.
Now, if there was one thing more
than another that Jeremiah was par
ticolar about, Is was his steaks being
rare,. and 'he remembered a certaii
seescion when be had risen firom the
table in disgast, and left the boose in
a rage, because te meat was cooked
a little too much-two of the children
being Ill, and his wife without a ser|
vant. S till, that was no execuse in
the sueiters eyes of Jeremiah Mimp
bilean, and he shptred his gteat dis
pleasure by slamming tihe front dor
forcibly attbr him. and .absenting
himself froom lint... for three days.

ableitafr~bet1 gr , sad a
thick coating of flour on the elbows ;
but he was too desperate to care for It
appearance, and determined to buy a
up a supply of bread and cakes at the ii
bakery ; lihe therefore loked the chil- ft
dren all up in his study and started, a
running all the way. o
In the mean time Sammie, aged s]
seven, amused himself by manufac
taring a kite out of valuable mann
script which lay in the desk, while
Bolivy tore a beautiful steel engra
ving out of one of his father's choice it
volumes to ornament the face of said a
kite ; and Jennie, a pretty, brown,
eyed sprite of three summers, in reach. F
ing up for the bottle of miicilage, e
knocked off the inkstand, which broke, if
leaving a great black stain on the tl
linodsome blue-and-drab carpet. The e
chair on which she stood slipped, and k
in hastening to get down, she dropped ti
teits bottle of paste, which fell in a ti
little shattered heap at her feet mak- fi
ing an additional blemish on papa's a
carpet. tl
Mr. Mimpblenf had always reproved a
his wife for calling the children nmis- d
chievous, for lie never eaw any thing II
at all wrong in their conduct. and p
congratulated himself that lie had the to
best behaved and most interesting 4
family in the country. V
Returing, lie immediately hurried it
to the study, and was horrified IeI p
yond expression at the scene which a
greeted him there. If his wife had e:
permitted such a thing to happen lie a
would have scolded and stormed p
around in a fearful manner, until lie ei
was quite certain that he had mIade Y
her perfectly wretched, and heattily 'i
sorry for ever having married such ti
a great, inconsiderate "bear" as him- P
self. b
However, he viewed the disaster
with anything but pleasure, but be- of
ing very much fatigued .with the ol
Inorning's work, he did not feel equal li
to the esort ot chastising tlreui, and L
so let them off with a feeble repri. ii
mand, and proceeded to distribute th
the bread and enkes,
Providence sent an old lady friend at
around that afternooh, and leaving ci
the children in her care, he rushed II
off to the intelligence office and en- ft
gaged a recent importation from Ger. G
many, whom he brought home with R
him in triumph. tl
Next morning he indulged in a oi
cigar, and walked up street to ascer- C
tal how affairs were progressing at as
the office. On his way back lie pur. I
chased a can of oysters, which lie pre- L
sented to Kathrina, asking "if she li
knew how to cook thelm," to whiich
she replied "Yah, yah I poll them in al
a stew I" and lie seated himself com- t1
placently to peruse a letter from his d
"other self," Mrs. Minmpbleuf. I'
"I ant having such a delightful a
timeo,' wrote is "affinity," "and te -V
hope that you are getting along o
nicely at home ; it will do you worlds n
of good to rest from your labors, and re
I know you are eqjoying it wonder
tully."
Bolivy had tied a rope to one of the u
chairs, and as Kathrina was coming in
in with the soup tureen, lie suddenly o
jerked it, tripping her up, and site a
fell crash into the room. b
Enraged at the boy and scalded by ft
the hot soup, the girl declared her in- d
tention of departing immediately, and a
forthwith did so, leaving Jeremiah to a
dish up the dinner as best he could. fi
After the meal was over he deter- 2
mined to clean the carpef. which was b
a new Brussels, purchased by his a
wife only a month before. Remem- n
bering that Belina used a sarubbilng
brush, soft-soap and ashes to take
the grease out of the kitchen floor,
he decided to try it in this instance.
Providing himself With a shovelful
of ashes, he spread it carefully over
the place where thie snup had been
spilled, then he poor~id a quantity of Ii
soft-soap and hot water on, and as
suemng a kneeling posture (the first O
time since his childhood), began to
scrub. Four square yards were coat
ed over wit lidahes, etc., whereas u',
ly a small portion of the earpoet had
been soiled, but he worked away ,
bravely.
What will Mrs. Mimpblouf say ?"
groaned the rmseerable ulan at last, t
as the mor6 lie rubbed the worse it t
looked. Perhaps a bucket of cold
water dashed over will Improve it," t
he sighed.
Linmpilg mdto the kitchen, and
hbnting for a tin pail, hIe recollected
that he had used it to hold the onilk
the evening previous, all the pans I
being dirty, and he could not find any
dish in the closet now, large enough I
to contain It, a ll tlhat remained to
be done was to pear it into one of the
wasubowla, and let it go. Passing
Sthe stove, his dressing-gown came in
contact with a heavy skillet, which
came down malieiously upon his
Icrm, rnd sant him pranelng ibout

France and the Centennial. drn
six
Among the European nations there als
is not a single government that looks lea
I with a friendly eye on this Republic slt
with the sole exception of one- mi
France. True. the oppressed of all 1i11
countries-the English, Getman, Ital- alt
lan, and all others-love America, as
the home of freedom; but the gov. to
ernments of these countries, those Ain
I known as the ruling classes, look on tig
I this republic with ill concelead his- as
t tility. It could not well be otherwise,
for this nation is a living protest
a against the despotic systems which or
these rulers uphold and defend. They .w
I all respect America, for they dare not ter
Stdespise her ; but France ilone loves a1'
Iher. FraI;nce is the only nation whose cot
I people will be represented at the Cen- ee
a tennial. The grcrerncmets of the oth. prI
er cosntries will be alone represented. blI
While other nations were dilscussing pi
I in packed cou;icils the projects of ex- ble
pending a little money in connection nei
with the Centennial, as an industrial hog
I exhibition, the people of republican till
anid freedom-loving France were dii
I pouring in their subseliptiotis for the bol
erection ofa statue to Liberty in New anI
York bay. And this commendable ind
action of the French people received paI
tite, countenance of the government, I
President MacMahon himself coutri- su
buting to the fund. tea
And now a movement has been set fli
on foot in France, under the auspices sea
of two of the most distinguished of coi
I living Frenchmen, Victor Hiugo nnd no
I Louis Blanc, to represent the work- it
ing classes of the nation, by sending tin
to Philadelphia a deputation of 2,000 ed
French workmen. They will be no ene
I strangers when they come hither to to
celebrate the Centennial of American
I Independence. Their fathers fought I
for our liberty at the Brandywine and wi
Germantown, in the dank days of the cet
I Revolution, They sent to our aid TIh
their fleet, and arms, and ten millions l
of money; and when the Englishl lin
Cornwallis marched with his empty i
scabbard out of Yorktown, he passed I"
between the lines of Washington and
Lafayette. Prance is the friend of i
º liberty and the feoe to tyranny all the
world over; and it is but natural that rý
I she should greet enthusiastically, in "'F
this hundredth year of its Indepen- t.
º dence, the American Republic, whose to
principles of freedom she has herself on
I adopted, and which, as Wendell go

Spleoed Beef,
Procure a piece of thin flank of
beef about ten pounds in weight,
.which salt, and let stand for about a
iweek ; when ready, split it open with
a knife and lay it out flat upon a
dresser, having previously prepared
six onions, chopped very fine, with
about ten sprigs of parsley, and the
leaves of ten sprigs of thyme, the
same of marjoram, two ounces of
mixed spice (without cinnamon), and
half an ounlce of black popper; mix
altogether, spread half upon the beef
as it lays before you, then fold it over
to its original shape, lay on the re
mnainder of the preparation, roll it up
tightly in cloth, boil press, and serve
as directed.
Barley Sugar.-Put some common
or clarified syrup into a saucepan
with a spout, such as for melting but
ter, if little is wanting to be made,
and boil it till it comes to a thickislh
consistence, carefully taking off what
ever scum may arise; and having
prepared a marble stone, either with
butter or oil, just to prevent sticking, "
pour the syrup gently along the mar
ble, in long sticks of whatever thick
ness may be desired; twist it, while
hot, at each end, and let it remain
till cool, when it will be fit for imme
diate use. Tihe rasped rind of lemon,
boiled with the syrup, gives a very
agteeable flavor to barley sugar; and,
indeed, the best is commonly so pre
pared.

sugar, one pint of sour milk, a scant
