*'LIT'LE BROTHER OF THE AIR."
There is a bird I klnow se weU.
It seems as it he tulist h:t1 atta
B~eside my crib whena I wa young:
ltefore 1 knew the way to spell
The namm of even the sesalest bird,
"lsn gentle, joyful song'I heard.
Now see if you can tell. my'dear,
WVhat bird it is that, every ye if,
Sings "Sweet---aweet.sweet-
very merry cheer.''
He comes in March, when *ttds are strong,
And snow returns to hide the earth:
But atiltia warms-his heart with mirth,
And waits for May. He lingers long
While flowers fade; and every day'
Itepea:s his small, oontontod lay;
As.if to say, we need not fear
The iaaeso?'a qhangp, itf love is here
Vflth "tsr.Seet--heet-sweet
very merry cheer,"
He does not wear a Joseph's-Eoat
Of many colors, smiart add itgay:
His sait, Is Qutaker Ibtin and gray.
With tbree.dark patchesaat hcs throat.
And yehot aLl the well-dressed throng
Not one can sing so brave a song,
It makes the pride of loolks appeae
A vafirantl fOolish thing to hOat
His "Sweet-sweet~sWest -
Very merry cheer."
A lofty Iniae be does not love.
But sits by choice, and welt at t'.l.
In hedges, end in Ittlk trbea
That stretch theiP slender arms above
The mtCedow-brook: and there he sings
Till all the field with pleasure rings;
And so he tells in every ear.
The lowliest home to heaven is near
In "weet-sweet-r weet-
very merry cheer,"
I like the tune. I like the words:
They seem so true, so free from art,
So friendly. and so full of heart.
That If but one of all the birds
Could ie my comrade everywhere.
My little brother of the air.
I'd choose the song-sparrow, my dear.
lBecauso he'd bless me. every year,
With "Sweet--sweett-sweet
very merry cheer."

Mlr. lIowser as
_ " he looked up
from his paper
and broke a
silence which
had lasted a
quarter of an
hour--"last night I heard our child
mnoaning in his sleep, and I noticed
that he looked pale and hollow-eyed
this morning. 1 suppose you know what
nils him?"
'"Nothing ails him, Mr. liowser
nothing but too much *y. You can't
find a healthier child in the whole

"I hope it is true, but I doubt it.
Having him under your eye every
hour in the day, you do not notice a

woman came into the office selling a
tbook on 'Ilow to Biring up Children.' I
had only to glance at it to see that it
was just what you wanted. It is full
of--"
"Who wrote it?" sharply demanded
Mrs. DJowser.
''I'll show you the book. It tells all
about mumps, measles, chicken pox
and everything else likely to ail a
child, and also prescribes the cure.
Let's see! It's by Annie Kathering
White. Did you ever hear of her?"
"Never, and I don't want to! It's
ten to one that she was never a mother
and doesn't know a case of mumps
from falling off a fence! For the land's
sake, don't get the idea that our child
wants dosing!"
"Our child may be all right, Mirs.
Bowser, or he may be all wrong. It
won't hurt anything to read what the
woman says. For instance, she gives
the premonitory symptoms of measles,
and says that a mother-' "
"lie had measles three months ago!"
"Well, here's all about whooping
cough. 'Twenty-four hours before
the cough comes the patient is restless.

the eyes-"
"I know all about that, and it will
be quite useless for you to go up to his
bed to see if the whites of his eyes
have turned blue or green. You have
hardly looked at him for three months
past, and now all of a sudden you are
greatly worried over his condition!"
"Mrs. Bowser!" said Mr. Bowser, as
he stood up and flourished the book in
his hand, "do you know that you are
talking to that child's father!"
"Of course, I do!"
"Then don't talk in that way! As
that child's father I naturally love
him. I feel anxious about his health.
A woman who has probably ,reared a
dozen children of her own writes a

But just then young Bowser. whc

picture of good health that Mir. Bowser
sat down with the feeling that he had
lost his case. It wasn't until MIrs.
BIowser was leading the boy back tc

"Death may not have actually placed

Questions of Health.
The popular notion that an athlete,
because of his athleticism, is a healthy
man is a delusive one. Muscular de
velopment is not an affair of the con
stitution: it is an accident. Strong
limbs and a weak heart are not infre
quently associates. Many a "strong
man" dies prematurely of consump
tion. If health may be defined as a
capacity for holding on to life, then in
many cases the weaklings are the
healtraiest. If such a definition is ac
curate, women are healthier than
men: their average length of days is
greater than ours. Hut it is doubtful
if centenarians, merely because they
are centenarians, are the healthiest.
I knew a case of a woman, who recent
ly died at .the age of one hundred and
five, who was slightly paralyzed, even
as a child, and who was practically
completely so for more than seventy
years. Could such a one have ever
been correctly described as healthy?
It is as hard to say what life is as to
say what health is, and the way in
which unhealthy folks are tenacious of
life is not the least of the marvels.-

that the silver question was the upper

cause it had a tendency to hide the
beneftteattiol Of the tariff of 1890, and
the calamities of that of 1844. otsd
the hdrnier is that the contrast be
tween them Will becotle too giating,
and that the offenses of McKinley, as
the chief engineer of the republican
defeats of 1890 and 1893, will be too
freshly bltoight to ~diiid, For it is not
to be denied that thei contrast is s'ery

the latter was bttel' thli the former.
The fact is that the diffeirence bitweezi
them was not sufficient to account for
the industrial Changes here recorded.
'there were other overxiiling etauses,
and among these the currency, or ratil=
er the credit question as dependent
upon the currency question, was by far
the tmost irnortant, The Sherman act,
5ecalled, by which fouir million five
hundred thousantd ounces of silver were
bought each month and added to the
flat money of the country, shook con
fidenec on both sides of the ocean in
the standard of value. Gradually4 but
with increasing volume, capital was
withdrawn from the country, taking
the form of gold exports, which be
came so large that after this act had
been in force two years and a half a
genuine alarm filled the public mind.
The panic of 1893 was the conse
qu.nce. It came just at the right time
to enable the McKinleyites to say that
It was caused by the election of Cleve
land and a democratic congress. They
availed themselves of the maxim Post
hoc propter hoc to the fullest extent,
and they persuaded the workingmen
of the country, who had lost employ
ment and had had their wages cut
down, that this was the true cause of
their sufferings. The workingmen
could not understand the mysteries of
finance, and although the democratic
party, under the lash of President
Cleveland, actually did the only thing
that could possibly restore confidence
and revive business, by repealing the
Sherman act, they voted by over
whelming majorities for a republican
congress.
It takes time to bring prosperity
back after so rude a shock as that
which the business of the country re
ceived in 1893, but the true remedy was
applied and the result was sure to fol
low. It has now come. The McKin
leyites are trying, in a feeble way, to
play their old trick over again. As
they said before that the panic was
caused by the apprehension of what
the democrats would do, although they
had actually done nothing, so they are
saying now that the good times are
caused by the hope of what the re
publicans will do, although they have
actually done nothing, and there is no
chance of their doing anything tariff
wise for two years to come.
This is an argument that will not
bear close examination. It may serve
for the campaign of this fall, but not
for next year. Long before the autumn
of 1890 it will have worn out. 1Most
likely the campaign of 1890 will turn
on other questions than the tariff, but
if the tariff is then uppermost the
most effective battle cry will be to
"let it alone." That will be the fetch
ing argument with the workingmen,
and to a large extent with their em
ployers also. In that case McKinley
will be unavailable, because he stands
for a change-the same kind of a
change that he made before. Es
pecially will he be committed to re
store and even increase the duties on
wool, in accordance with the demands
of the wool-growing triumvirate,
Lawrence, llarpster and Delano And,
of course, any change in reference to
wool must bring in corresponding
changes in woolens, worsteds, mixed
goods, textiles of all kinds; in short,
everything that anybody wants if he
has a "pull" with the committee of
ways and means. Does the reuublican
party want to wake up the spirit that
smote it in 18907 If so, it can be
pretty sure of doing it by making Mc
Kinley its candidate next year.-N. Y.
Post.
Another Natil.
The increased number and prosperity
of the tin-plate mills drive another nail
in the coffin of McKinleyism. Thenew
tariff made tin ore free, and it was be
fore the McKinley bill clapped on the
preposterous and oppressive tae of
t cents a pound. It also reduced
the duty on tin plate from 22-10
cents a pound to 1 1-5 cents. Yet there
are 35 tin works rolling their own
black plates and 7 in course of erec
tion. In addition, there are 30 tin
plate dipping works prospering be
cause of the untaxed metal. The
amount of finished plates will be in
creased this year, according to the
MIetal Worker, from 4,110,000 boxes of
finished plates to 5,500,000 boxes, or
nearly four-fifths the consumption.
The logic of events is making short
work with the theories of high-tariff
men.-N. Y. WVorld.
--If the reduction of the tarif
under the Wilson bill has not been a
leading factor in this wage-advancing
movement, why is it that the advanoe

protected industries? Will some high.

brighii.: fr" tulid demrocEacy, and Its
chances of retaini'f ec-trol of the af
fairs of the country are tlauitebtedly
growing every day. Of course, the
most proitlinent factor in this improve
ment (f drrdition is the return of busi
fiess prosperity, the apparent assurance
of it; Ct itluarcd and the universal
recognition of tild fat that this is due
almost wholly to the eredietion of
bad republican laws from the statues
and to thi irzss and beneficent legis
latiio of thel ifty-third congress, con
trolled in both branches by the demo
4ratie party for tihe first time in al
most fo:-ty years. The utter failure of
the weak Strondg adstatitration in
New York city, emphusire6 by the bit
ter differences that divide tho repub
licari party in the Empire state, makes
a great democratic victory in that state
this fall*a certainty. The olity ques
tion aibout it is the matter of the size
of the majority, and when New York
city is confidently claimed by upwards
of db+eÃ½tt-ive thousand for the deua
ocratic ticket it will be seen that the
majority in the state inas rise to a
very high figure.
'Ihe rccklecs partisanship which was
projected into the Now York constitu
tional convention, arnd which sought to
render permarent the most outrageous
gerxylllander that has yet been at
tempted anywviee by imibedding it in
the organic law of the state, has
aroused great dissatisfaction among
those fair-minded members of the re
purblitti party who have in New York
so often evidenced their independence
aiid integrity, so that this outrageous
piece of partisanship will recoil vio
lcntly upon its authors. It is not alone
in New York that the situation looks
hopeful. The serious divisions in Ohio
and the great dissatisfaction prevalent
against the republican legislature in
Illinois, no less than the great inter
necine conflict now going on between
Sir llatthewv of the Mailed Hand, and
the fat-famed hog combine in Pennsyl
vania, give rise to much confidence of
republican de feat in all those states.
Off years are always productive of
surprises, and it is a surious fact that
the part-y that has met reverses in the
fall elections preceding presidential
campaigns has for many years proved
a sure twinner in the ens:tlug contest.
raversing only the last dozen years
will demonstrate this conclusively. In
18S3 New York and Ohio went heavily
democratic. Then came Cleveland's
first election. All the doubtful states
went republican in the fall of 1887 ex
cepting New York, and in that state
occurred the great democratic split re
sultant upon Henry George's cam
paign, which rendered democratic
prospects discouraging. Then came
Harrison's victory. In the fall of 1891
aswill be well remembered New York,
Massachusetts and Iowa went demo
cratic, clearing the way for the great
victory that returned President Cleve
land to the white house.
So that the early brightening of
democratic prvpects this year and the
promise of democratic quccess this fall
are inspiring harbingers of a great
victory next vear.-Detroit Free Press.
SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE.
Republicans Trying to Dodge Their Own
Arguments.
The republican papers resisted the
improvement in business as long as
they were able. They were unwilling
to admit that improvement was taking
place. They made themselves ridicu
lous by calamity howls even after their
news columns announced the unmis
takable improvementin business. Now
that they deem it inexpedient longer
to deny the fact, they insist that the
democratic party is not entitled to any
credit for it.
.The new attitude is as untenable and
inconsistent as tile old one. Repub
licans have always maintained that
whatever happened under republican
rule was due to republican rule, al
ways provided it was favorable. They
have insisted that whatever occurs
under a democratic administration is
due to the acts of that administra
tion, provided always it is in the
nature of disaster. But these two
positions cannot be held together.
They are absurd. If the repub
licans are entitled to credit for
prosperity when they are in power,
so are the democrats under similar con
ditions. They held the democrats re
sponsible for a panic which began and
ran much of its course before the dem
ocrats had legislated at all. This was,
of course, altogether unjust and un
reasonable. But after the party had
perfected all the legislation that it was
able to perfect, republican papers and
politicians said the laws passed, es
pecially the tariff bill, would ruin the
country. They admit that the tariff
bill cannot be changed for two years,
but still they insist that it has had
nothing to do with the return of pros
perity. In saying this. they ignore or
repudiate the arguments which they
have been urging for twenty years.
Acute observers know very well that
we were near a panic in February last,
and that thle action of the administra
tion averted it. This action was de
nounced by republicans at the time,
but business interests have been on the
up-grade ever since. For this the
democratic administration is entitled
to the whole credit. To deny it is to
cast reflection on one's own' intelli
gence.-Louisville Courier-Journal.
-WVhat some of the glass manufac'
turers called a ruinous cut in the tariff
on glass was made by the new tariff
law, but we notice that the window
glass trust, which controls eighty per
cent. of the western output, has found
in this lower tariff protection enough
to justify a twenty-five per cent. mark
ing up of prices The trust's cry of
ruin from tariff reduction was as
groundless as its claims have been of
making a suppression of competition
