HIGH LIGi-i F OF FASHION.
EmpeeialIly as They Relate to the
New Evening (Towna.
For evening dress we cling to the
soft charms of chiffon, and the spangle
appears to have received a permanent
welcome. A charming .white tulle
Sdress lightly dotted with spangles has
a fringe of pink roses on the hem, and
a black net dress closely covered with
silver spangles, lined with white, bears
applications of white silk roses with
excellent effect.
White silk roses on a white silk dress,
made in lace. with the petals elaborate
ly stuffed to stand gut from the ma
terial, are among prouigal fancies.
Fringe is a noteworthy revival. Si
ver bullion fringe decorates a dress of
pale blue panne, with the skirt em
broidered in pilver. while the sleeves
I are formed of two squares of white
tulle, with a silver tassel at each cor
ner, a novel sleeve, but yet decorative
and most becoming.
The newest paillettes are those of the
mother of pearl description, while the
platinum ones are also recognized,
these latter looking particularly well
in a thick raised design on a back
ground of gray chiffon.
A conspi;uous note on the newest
models is the sloping shoulder. This
outline is easily contrived, of course,
by placing the sleeve below the shoul
dier line, where appears sonme linc of

We are giving more attention to
beauty and hospitality in the portals of
our homes. In the study of decoration
one may well begin, literally, on the
threshold with the example of ade

in our illustration.
This is a fine example of hammered
ironwork of the period of Louis XVI.,
-characteristic in design, yet well adapt

basis.

RIBBON FLOWERS.
One of Fashion's Prettiest Faneit v.
How They Are Made.
Dame Fashion is constantly invent
ing new ideas and capriciously chang
ing her moods and tenses to please
even the most fickle (levotee. One of
her latest fads is the ribbon flower
garniture of marvelous blossoms evolv
ed from a chaotic mass of many hued
ribbons. And such flowers! No arti
ficial flowers, imported or otherwise,
have ever looked so real as these rib
bon creations, and. as they are rather
expensive to purchase. I would sug
gest that the handy girl turn her deft
fingers to account and make her own
ribbon garniture. When I have watch
ed the shopgirls making flowers. I have
taken pains to ask them where they
learned their accomplishment. The in
variable reply has been, "We never
learned; we just commenced doing it."
which proves that nothing is impossi
ble, for "where there is a will there is
a way." says Louise E. I)ew in the La

The chrysanthemum here shown is
pretty for the hair or bodice. It is

tened to one wire so the "stem" will
not be too large. Common wire may
be used, and dark green satint ribbon
may be wound around it for the stem.
However, before covering the wire it
should be thrust through a culio, which
forms the calyx.
One yard of crimson satin ribbon
three inches wide was used to make
the rose. Cut the ribbon in four strips,
crush each strip through the center to
give it the crinkled rose petal appear
ance; then draw the two ends together
at the base and attach to a :toem wire.
Place the "center," or "rose heart," in
position; then twist all the wires to
gether and thrust through the culio.
Wind the stem with dark green satin
ribbon, and, presto, change, when
leaves are attached you have a rose
which will do duty to liven up the
black gown or will be most becoming
worn in the hair! Poppies may be
fashioned in the same way, using the
poppy centers and leaves instead of the

THE LATEST WHIM.
Fashion Promi.es to Take rp thie
Cap-Charming and Not "Cappy."
The cap is the latest folly. There i
so much to be said for it that it is no
to be wondered at that a great deal ;,,
said against it. You see, in the ol,.
days-no, the middle aged days-onr'
wore a 'ap because one was bald or
aged or married or something equally
convincing. *Further back Perdita and
other lovely women wore caps for a
far more charming reason--bectiuse they
looked bewitching in them. Nowadays
-well. nowadatys we have the courage
of our convictions. We are to wear
them and decline to give any "sensible"
reason for so doing.
The varieties of the cap are legion.
To begin with, there is the first step.
You take a scarf of some soft lace
alencon, mechlin, tambour. Limerick -
one of those laces that droop and take
graceful lines whichever way they fall.
With a jeweled pin gather up the cen
ter of the scarf and fasten it just be
hind the pouf of hair over your fore
head. The two ends, hanging like lap
pets, cann be treated in three ways
they can be tied in a little bow well on
one side, they can be tied at the back
of the neck or they can be left loose.
just held in place by an Italian hairpin
behind each ear.
A triangle of lace may be pressed
into the service. One point is pinned iv
front a la Marie Stuart: the oilher two
afford points from whence the strings

bothers one at all. A rather fluffy
type, a frilled edge, a certain irregular
ity of demeanor, is fascinating and
preferable, thougli the Puritan coyness
and demure aspect are undoubtedly
becoming to many women. For hair
dressed high the little round, cap, not
necessarily lace, ii fact. preferably of
a plain material, frilled all round with
a knot of colored ribbon strings, vei7y
narrow ones, is extremely pretty.
Before going on to the more elabo
rate kind, here is one more wrtnkle for
a cap that is not a cap until it is on
your head. Take a piece of lace about
three or four inches wide and long
enough to reach "plain" from lobe to
lobe of the ears when laid over the
head. Secure it thus, pinning the cor
ners farthest behind each ear to the
hair. This leaves the other two cor

ners hanging loosely, and a tiny pearl
drop or some little dangle in keeping
should depend from each. This cap,
again, is improved by a trifling peak i'u
the center.
When we leave the simple lace things
and come to something with a founda
tion, the 3Marie Stuart mode comes back
again and again. This time the wired
front rises above the hair before de
seending into its little peak. Wh~' is
that peak always so becoming, and

and of course this latest whim is a no
tion entirely for the house.
Clam Stew.
One quart of clams; cover with half
pint df cold water and let come to -a
boil; season with salt and pepper; add
three pints of milk, two butter crack

fuls of butter; let it come to a boil and
serve in a tureen, with a hard boiled
egg sifted through a potato ricer.

an attractive finish to that fabric: so

THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.
Optiinism, Ambition and Industry
Keep the Young Folks Young.
Few of us wear the same garments
continuously-the modern tend.n.y is
said to be rather to the other extreime-
and it is natural that the cape of good
hope should not be always on our shoul
ders. Apparently there is not a sulli
cient number of these garments to go
round, for optimism never affects all
the world at the same time. Even in
a household it is sometimes found that
when mother is cheerful father invari
ably retires into gloom.
But if everybody were always bright
and hopeless these clharateristols
would no longer be looked upon as es
timable. and the conclusion one comles
to is that, considering the hurry, the
world was made nearly as well as we
ourselves could have mlade it. One of
Mr. Barrie's charancters remarks that
an optimist is a lazy man. ('ertainly
against the man who fusses about
prophesying disaster the charge of in
dolence cannot. unfortunately, le
brought.
The pessimist gets a great reputation.
because if his dismal forebodings are
not realized in fact no one feels in
clined to blame him, and if by chance
they do occur he takes every means of
proclaiming his amazing powers of
foresight. The prophets of the world
only need doggedness and longevity,
and the law of chances makes it likely
that they will be right some day. Thuis
it*is that a name is earned for indus
try. As a matter of fact, most men se
lect the role which is the easiest for
them to play.
Ambition so often goes hand1 in handl
with hopefulness that the optimist can
not be fairly charged with slothfulness.
No man would waste time in dro:lning
dreams if he thought it were quite im
possible they should ever come true.
Young men studying industriously re
mind themselves that they "may be
president some day." The statement
that it is love that makes the world go
round has been proved by scientific
men to be fallacious. They would have
more difficulty in contesting the argu
ment that it is hope that makes the
world go on.
Bachelors are notorious experts (in
their own opinion) on the bringing up
of children, and that is why I dare to
suggest that youngsters should always
be allowed to be enthusiastic about
something. Unless they acquire the
habit in early youth they will never
get it later on, and the grownup per
son without enthusiasm is so useless as
to be deserving of scorn. By learning
to ride a hobby well in the days of
youth children are preparing them
selves for the more important steeple
chases later on. It comes in the scheme
of training which they-have to under
go. But keep them young, all the same.
while you can. They will be grown up
a long, long time. W. P. RIDGE.
The Wholesome Cellar.
Better a coat of plaster on foundation
walls, inside and out, and a cement
floor than oriental rugs or a piano: bet

consider the second proposition.
Keep it clean.
Of course no one would even permit
such an unthinkable thing as bit:: of
spoiled animal matter to linger in the
cellar. Vegetable matter is nearly as
bad, for the injurious gases generated
by decay float all through the house.
