STATE LEGISLATION IN GEORGIA.
Dear Sir: —As to your editorials,
they are simply fine. But will you
allow a few questions and sugges
tions?
First, I want to say that the Georg
gia Legislature is in session, and that
some very important matters (in all
probability) will be considered by
that body.
' Such questions as are at issue to
day are: The extension of the W. &
A. Road, the building of long public
highways leading from Atlanta in
different directions (mainly for the
benefit of automobiles). A commis
sioner of agriculture for each county,
a decrease in the number of Railroad
Commissioners, and a deprivation of
a part of their power. Bi-ennial ses
sions of the Legislature, and others.
Now these are questions of vital
importance. Why not speak out
what you think of them; let your
power be a live wire in shaping legis
lation in Georgia.
What do you think of the proposi
tion to extend the State’s road to the
sea ?
Would you not consider the author
of such legislation a constructive
statesman? Do you think it would
be profitable to the people to issue
bonds to build public roads from At
lanta to Albany, and other points,
when it is a conceded fact that they
are for the special benefit of those
who own automobiles? (Os course,
we understand that the roads will be
free to the use of the farmer.)
What about a Commissioner of
Agriculture for each county? Don’t
you think that there is something
that we could do of far more benefit
to the farmer than putting another
heavy burden upon his already laden
shoulder?
What about a decrease in the num
ber of Railroad Commissioners; have
they too much authority? Shall thpy
retain their authority, or shall they
be made mere figureheads?
What do you see in it for the peo
ple by changing the meeting of the
Legislature from annual to bi-ennial
sessions?
You know that if the gang that is
now in power can fix the law to suit
themselves, and then stave off legis
lation two years instead of one, they
are more strongly entrenched.
It’s a hard matter to get the peo
ple interested in governmental af
fairs, and then they won’t stay in
terested long.
Out of all these propositions I
don’t think that there is but one
that the Legislature should even con
sider, and that is the extension of the
State’s road to the sea.
The convict bill passed by the last
Legislature is very faulty.
Every county that can not afford
to use their part of the convicts,
should be paid for them by the coun
ty that does use them. What think
you?

on the editorial page some discussion
of legislative topics. We agree with
him in nearly everything he says.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
The Jeffersonian is a national paper,
and we have to be careful not to put
too much stress on what is happen
ing locally.
“CONSTITUTIONAL UNION
PARTY.”
Dear Sir: —In reading “Letters
from the People” I occasionally find
one proposing a new name for a re
organized Reform Party. Populist,
or People’s Party, is good enough
for me, but if a majority want a new
name I suggest the name, Constitu
tional Union Party, which I construe
to mean equal and exact justice to
all, with no special favors for any
man, or set of men, at the expense
and exclusion of all other people.

“WHY DO WE VOTE FOR LAWS
THAT ARE TAKING AWAY
OUR LIBERTY?”
Kind Sir: —Enclosed find one dol
lar, for which send the weekly Jef
fersonian and your prize knife to Mr.
L. S. Giles, Daingerfield, Texas. I
am doing all I can for you and the
principles of the Populist platform.
I see some Populists want to
change the name of our party, but
I think its name is a most appro
priate one, and a change would be
detrimental to the one original
policy.
I never, never, go into a Demo
cratic primary. I never pledge my
self to vote for any Democratic nomi
nee. I withhold my vote rather than
vote for the modern Democrat. When
a man announces himself a candi
date he starts of with, “The Dear
people,” “My Good fellow citizens,
your interest as toilers shall be up
permost in all my efforts, and, and,
and.” But after they are elected it
is, “The people be d —d.” Give us
the initiative, the referendum and
recall. Give us some chance for a
redress, and we will have some show
to displace our trust, corporation
legislators and put in honest men in
«
their places. A farmer has no pro
tection at all, yet the whole people
live by his toil. What did the last
Legislature of Texas do? Nothing
for the common people. What has
our present Congress done? Passed
laws to protect the trust and the cor
poration companies. Who are the
sufferers? The consumers.
Look at this great blow about good
roads. Who will pay for the making
of the good roads? The farmer and
the laborer. Who gets the benefit
and pays nothing? The automo
bilist.
It seems to me that the people can
and do see the great wrong done to
the laboring classes. Then, why
don’t the laboring class band to
gether and make a Herculean effort
to suppress by their vote, and forever
obliterate the powers that are mak
ing slaves of you, your wives, moth
ers, sons and daughters? Is it
through fear of losing popularity, or
fear of public opinion, or is fear of
party lash that drives you to uphold
principles that are slowly pushing
3effersonian
you and yours deeper into poverty
and want and taking your liberty and
freedom from you? If so, may the
Lord open your eyes and give you
courage to rise in your manhood and
contend for that which rightfully be
longs to you.
Hoping that the laboring class may
speedily see where they are drifting
under the aristocratic and moneyed
power and set about saving them
selves from worse slavery, I beg to
remain
Respectfully yours,
R. I. THOMPSON.

HERE IS ONE MAN IN THE
WATCH TOWER.
Jeffersonian:—Enclosed you will
find subscription for the Magazine,
beginning -with the current number.
Please direct the publication to W.
H. Brassfield, Gashland, Missouri.
Mr. B. is a tried and true Populist.
This is the third subscription I have
sent in lately and now I think I am
entitled to the knife, therefore please
send the same to my address.
I admire your pluck in denouncing
the Senators who vote, as such, con
trary to their party platform and
party principles. Senator Stone will
have a hard time in explaining why
he should vote for 2 5 cents protec
ton on iron and then vote to put har
vest trust on the free list.
The Senator thinks a great deal of
Mr. Watson and would like to see his
position sustained politically, but
when he strays from the true Demo
cratic doctrine, and embraces protec
tion for protection’s sake, and then
makes an effort to throttle the trust
in voting for free farm machinery, to
hoodwink his farmer constituents,
he will find when he returns to give
an account of himself —that he has
said something.
Missouri voted for Mr. Taft believ
ing that he was honest in his tariff
views. Now will he use his preroga
tive and veto this tariff bill so much
in opposition to his recorded position
and party platform, or will he em
brace it with its Democratic perfidy,
and place himself in an inextricable
position? Time alone will tell.
Yours truly,

SCORES OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL
SYSTEM.
I have been doing some missionary
work of late, trying to spread the
Jeffersonians, for I love the truth
which I find in them and want others
to see it.
The greatest difficulty I meet with
is getting people to read. Some
haven’t time, others can’t read. We
find quite a lot of the latter, and so I
am driven to ask a hard question:
Why can’t they?
The only logical reason is, they
haven’t been taught. Let us quote
from the Atlanta Georgian of March
9, 1909. In part it says: “Georgia
is doing an injury not only to her
taxpayers, but to her youthful off
spring in not providing some means
for making her expenditures for the
common schools more effective.” And
in the next paragraph we find this,
“The only civilized countries on the
globe which can furnish her a prece
dent in this respect are Russia and
Turkey.” And again it says, “Eleven
millions of dollars in five years is
generous enough it seems, but in
spite of this ample provision from
the State treasury there are 84,380
illiterate children today in Georgia.”
Now what? Don’t understand me
to be doubting the truth of The
Georgian. Ido not.
Eleven millions in five years.
What went with all that money?
Let’s see. Well, it takes a whole lot
to support the system before any re
sults can be counted on. We have a
State Commission and State Board,
at so much per; we have 146 County
Commissioners, at so much per; and
county boards at so much per diem
while in session. So we find it takes
quite a lot of oil to keep the ma
chine in running order.
We should ask the General Assem
bly of our State, “Give us back our
children; we can, and will, school
them. You have been trying to
school them for nearly forty years,
and have failed so far. Your millions
haven’t educated them.”
I am speaking of rural schools.
Most city and town schools are sup
ported, to more or less extent, by lo
cal taxation, so we of the country
are being hurt the more by the pres
ent system.
Let the State take down her sign
as an educator, for forty years is long
enough to experiment on any one
thing.
I remain your friend,
ALFRED MADDOX.

ENDORSING THE MISSIONARY
ARTICLES.
Dear Mr. Watson:—Your articles
in the Jeffersonian Magazine are
causing a great deal of argument all
over the country—and, do you know,
they are opening the people’s eyes as
never before?
All people (almost unanimously)
are with you—they endorse your ar
ticles (except the preachers). It’s a
fact that the preachers are the great
est enemies to the truth. Conditions
now are just like they were in the
close of the Jewish age, during the
ministry of Christ on earth. It was
the established Church (Pharisees)
that fought the truth. It’s so now.
The preachers and priests don’t want
the people enlightened.
I enclose a clipping from the Ala
bama Christian (?) Advocate pub
lished at Birmingham. It is plain
that he offers no argument—only
malice and prejudice against you.
Wishing you success, I am
