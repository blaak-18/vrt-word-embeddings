A SLOW TRAIN. /
I?
I rains are too slow for the impa
tient the world over. On a branch
line in England the restless traveler
inquired frequently of the sleepy por
ter, “Isn’t that train coming soon?”
The weary official was at last able to
say, Ah, yas, sir, it’ll be getting
near now. Here comes the engine
driver’s dog.”
A similar lack of speed is indicat
ed, says a writer in the Washington
Star, in a tale told by Gen. J. D.
Grant of a railway in one of the
(Southern states.
The line was so slow that the peo
ple took to lampooning it in the press.
Thus on Decoration day, a planter
wrote to the Rapier, the leading pa

‘‘ Ihe Editor of the Rapier, Sir: Is
there no way to put a stop to beg

HOT PIE.
For a delicious pie, such as they
make in the peach belt, fill a deep pie
dish with peaches that have been
peeled, stoned and cut into quarters.
Season them with sugar, butter and
a tablespoonful of molasses and, if
it is wanted, a little cinnamon. Put
over the top a rich pie crust and
bake. Serve the pie with rich
cream. The pie is sometimes not
seasoned until after baking, when
the cover is lifted off carefully; while
the pie is still hot sugar and cinna--
mon are sprinkled in and the cover
is replaced.
