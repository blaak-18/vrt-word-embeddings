Kellogg's Government is the "old I
man of the mountain," seated up
on the shoulders of Louisiana day
and night. An incubus-a terror
-.-an intolerable burden. Louisi
ana, gagged and blinded, totters
along with this horrible old man
astride her neck goading her to
movements.
This has been our condition for
four years, and we are asked to
change one old man for another,
and that other in the person of
Packard. A man whose very
name calls up in the heart of eve
ry true and honorable son of
Louisiana, the deepest feelings of
indignation-a brutal, cowardly
United States Marshal, who has,
at the beck and call of his master
at Washington, rode rough-shod
over the liberties and persons ot
the whites of Louisiana. A man
who has sustained the thieves un
der Warmouth and Kellogg in
every vile act they have commit
ted; who is: the prince of Carpet
baggers, and represents Grpnt
with all his attendant horrors to
us.
This is the Reform (!) Governor

FOR GOVERNOR.
The time for the selection of can- wii
didates to fill all our offices is rapid
ly approaching, and it behooves us to imp
look carefully around and select such oui
men for the ticket as possess all the er
requirements necessary. We admit col
that in the past our party has not
looked well to its choice of men, they an
have all been honest men, which in ane
itself is a great recommendation, but "i"
other qualities are requisite to win, w
rat
added to that of honesty,
Character and capability are virtues nj
that are indispei ile, and if availa. nm
billy, as to local fitness, habita- er
tion, and the magnetic power to en
I th
thuse the mnassess be added, we have hi
the requirements combined that are
sure to crown our efforts with victory; ri
without the last, you may have a can- ha
didate pure as the icicle that hung
r Itm Diatl5 temple, and as cold. We th
have the men among us of full fitness fa
for all positions. In great revolutions fit
S in which bodies of society are enga- i
ged, from the womb of the publicer
spring lenders ready armed at the re
call of the hour. Let ns then choose
only such as meet the requirements. la
That man who talks of his person- a
al likes, that attemps to thrust him
self upon us at the suggestionl of his p
friends, is dangerous. We hare a to
battle before us in which success f
means salvation, defeat the opposite, t
and we are not prepared to listen to e1
the claims% of individual preferment ti
in such an hour as this. si
In the selection of a candidate for a
Governot by the Democratic-Conser- )
vative party, we feel assured they ti
will not fail to supply what is requir- n
ed of them by the people. tl
We hear many names mentioned in a
that connection; names full sound
ing, good and true, but among them ,
all we think but few possess all the I1
requirements, which combined, make a8
up the MAN for the occasion. It is not
capability, it is not honesty or char- 1b
acter alone that qualify men for these v
d trying times; we admit the virtues tl
- named are reinisite, but there is one a
S other indespensable to success-for
r what availeth it if we nominate a pure r
man who is unpopular, we cannot E
r rally to his support all the elements ii
in our State which msst be enthused C
to ain the victorv.
S os is no oiary camlaign. -W
ShIMare an enemy opposing as unscru- I
to pulous in villainy-and backed by all t
Sthe legislation to extend their pow
of er that eight years of Warmonth and
ef Kellogg rule could crowd upon the
C- statute books. If this enemy sec
of ceed, we stand appalled at tihe thought
of of the consequences. Four years I
ly longer role of Radicalism would des- t
troy Louisiana, root and branch.
er i
For these reasons, we shllould be
of circuamspect, calm and patriotic at our j
In Convention on the 24th nit. No man
n- should be placed upon thile ticket who
in was not up to all the necessry re
it- quirements of the hour. Packard,
the man of thle Radical party repre

to select a man to represent all the

The Last Appeal. not
-- cer
WILL OUR COLORED FRIENDS IIEED US ?
We do not hesitate to say that great ,
importance to our local atfairs and to no
our State at large hangs upon a prop- Go
er and emphatic answer from our an
colored citizens to the earnest appeal oh
we now propose to make to them. Le
All classes and races of men have no
arrived at the station of citizenship cri
and enjoyed its privileges and bles- kn
sings through hard struggles, through cal
wars and devastation ; and race after ,i
race has been destroyed, by those Sh
more powerful, in their struggles or
without reaching the great end cf Pu
man-to enjoy life, liberty and prop- the
erty, freely and fully, governed by isi
such laws only as protect him in these p
three great blessings and conduce to wl
his happiness thereby.
It has been reserved for the colored an
race to reach this highest summit of wl
man's hopes without these attendent in
horrors. He has been invested of
with a full and free enjoyment of "
those blessings which cost our fore- th
t fathers oceans of blood and millions th
of treasure, with but the loss of an pi
insignificant sum of either. or
This great boon that the negro now
enjoys has been given him by the white
race in fee simple.
All men are his equals before the
law and he per contra is the equal of at
any man. Under the constitution of il,
our country he is allowed the privil A
edge to enjoy life, liberty and the A
pursuit of happiness to the fullest ex- st
s tent--so far can he go in the enjoy- pi
I ment of these blessings that the lati- ti
tude is only limited to the fact that tl
he mrust not inteif'ere with others in the 11
Senjoyment of their rights. And here is ai
t the point, the warning point we de- o0
sire to make-the appeal we do make ai
r as men who inhe'ited our liberty from re
all ages to there who were allowed it a
by us. We ask the calm considera- it
V tion of all thinking fairiminded colored
men to ours words of warning; for n
they are big with import to them all Ih
n and we most sincerely hope that those p
who do read, who do think, and who tl
are fairminded will impress th$ ttuths a
we now utter upon the minds of those c
e less educated, more ignorant and more o
e susceptible to bad influences. fi
In some lower parishes of our State ti
the colored man, much abused and h
long used by the radical thieves as a ii
e voting power to place them in office b
a that they might plunder no and the a
e negro as well, have been deserting p
the republican ranks in large numbers, a
to such an extent in fact, as to give ii
rise to what is called the "Union Rights "
It Stop" organization. An order where- c
ts in every man is sworn to vote the radi- t'
d cal ticket blindly, and without question, 8
and those who do not join, the members a
We have it from ueon stee asntor
- ity that this order is being attenlpted t
11 to be organized in our parish and
u npon this comes our appeal and warn
d ing.
We ask the colored nean if this is
Snot a free country where every man
E be he white or black has the right to
it act and vote as he pleases ? You
rs have this boon of voting and you
. take an oath to kill other colored men
that do not elhoose to ,ole viilh you or 1
for your ses I
e We ask you if that is your idea of
ir justice or liberty "
n Is that fair or honest I
Is it not clanning togethler to mtur
der your fellow man for hAls opinion
e sake !
d, Remember that we are your friends.
e- Whatever others may say to you about
e our intentions regarding your rights,
he we say this;: We intend to preserve
to you all yeour rights ander tim Con.
stitutios of the United Stares. You
ly shall vote as other citizens do, freely
er and fairly, for all ties to come, and to
hy that end we pledge our sacred konor
and our lives.
But we will not submit that white
Syoue enjoy the great boon of doing as
ys- you please as citisens that yon will
3st be allowed to kill and slay those of
ild your race who honestly differ with
b you. We do not intend yon hala or
ganite any such society in this par
n log as the "Urien R1ights Stops." We
ve will not allow any sleh organization
of, to exist for a moment that would
rhind its members to kill those who

' We now ask you to pause, stop and
teliect but one momenton the serious
pet consequenees that will certainly fol
in. low if you should go on with such a
iry society as we have named. No fair
the minded men will hesitate a moment
