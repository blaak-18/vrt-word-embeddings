PAGE TWO
WOMAN, LAW’S INSPIRATION
EFORE the members of the
I Tattnall County Bar Asso
i ciation and lawyers and
I guests from other counties
composing the Atlantic judicial cir
cuit, Judge H . D. D. Twiggs yester
day, delivered an address on “Wo
man, the Inspiration of the Law.”
The judge was given a'vote of thanks
and was warmly complimented upon
his eloquent effort. The dinner was
at Bannon Lodge, Thunderbolt. He
said, in part, as follows:
“When I mentioned to the distin
guished judge of the Atlantic circuit,
whom I casually met a day of two
since, the subject of the toast to
which I was to speak today, he look
ed at me sympathetically, a cloud
gathered on his handsome brow, and
he said, with a tone of deep regret:
“ ‘The committee made a grave
mistake in the selection of a speaker
who had so' little knowledge of the
subject.’
“He left me in doubt as to which
he referred to —women or the law—
but as woman is the inspiration of
the law, I take it that he meant both.
“At all events, I promptly agreed
with him, the more so because I
thought how much better he was
qualified to handle this inspiring
subject. With the mantle of woman
upon his shoulders, flowing with the
ermine he wears so well, he would
have resembled Mark Anthony in the
Roman forum pleading the cause of
the dead Caesar, but with a nobler
theme. Mounted upon woman’s an
gelic wings, he would have soared to
empyrean hights and bathed the
plumage of his thoughts in the
sparkling dewdrops of heaven.
The Story of Eve.
“Mr. Chairman, woman has been
the inspiration of the law, human
and divine, since the morning stars
sang together in tile Garden of God
and Eve became the mother of man
kind. She came from man’s side and
has never left it; she has been his
inspiration in every effort he has
made and in all the great achieve
ments he has accomplished.
“The appearance of the first wo
man on earth, whether the story be
literal or allegorical, is the most
thrilling, tragic and pathetic episode
in the world’s history.
“Were I a poet, I would ask no
greater theme than this marvelous
story of our first parents. For a cen
tury Adam was undisputed master of
the world—a century of familiar con
verse with the Omnipotent and Omni
present God. I say a century, because
we are told that he was more than
one hundred years old when he lost
a rib and gained a wife, and one hun
dred and thirty years old when his
third child was born—three children
in thirty years. Rather a poor rec
ord to start a world with, particular
ly in view of specific instructions to
‘be fruitful and multiply;’ but he
made up for lost time, for after the
birth of Seth we are told that he be
gat sons and daughters.
God’s Most Splendid Gift.
“To a superficial observer, woman
does not seem to have been included
in the original plan of creation—she
would seem to be unnecessary, for if
God could create one man out of the
Subject of Address by Judge H. D. Twiggs
dust of the earth, He could create a
million more, and keep on creation
as long as His dust held out. Indeed*
for a long time, woman was not es
sential to Adam’s happiness and
peace of mind. He had no buttons
to sew on, no socks to darn, no
clothes to press, for his breeches did
not bag at the knees. The truth is
that Eve was not created at the time
Adam was because Adam was made
out of very poor clay, and there was
none fine enough with which to create
God’s most splendid gift to the world,
and for one hundred years, humanly
speaking, Adam was alone.
“Ambition and avarice, jealousy and
passion had no place in Adam’s peace
ful bosom. He is not in the grove of
Daphne, where lust is law, but in the
Garden of God where love is life, and
he is master of every fowl in the air
and beast in the field, and in the lan
guage of the brilliant Brann, ‘The for
est monarch lays his massive head on
Adam’s knee and the spotted leopard
curls lovingly at his feet. High above
the Caucasian peaks a condor poises
motionless in midheaven where the
unrisen sun gilds his wings with’ bur
nished gold. Higher and higher the
great sun mounts and bathes in royal
purple Eden’s virgin splendors, and
God walks familiar with Adam and
spreads before his wondering eye
creation’s mighty plan and God sus
pects that Adam is not content, for
w T e hear Him saying, ‘lt is not good
for man to be alone.”
“The clay of which the first man
was made begins to assert itself. He
watched the panther foundling his
playful cubs and the eagle guarding
its imperial brood on the beetling
crag, and the paternal instinct
awakens within him. He hears the
mockingbird thrilling to his mate
and the turtle dove pitying his lone
liness, and a great longing takes pos
session of him—and yet a helpmeet
had not been found for him.
“Sick at heart he turns away; the
sunset had lost its glory and life all
its sweetness. He heedlessly roams
through Eden’s mighty woods while
the fireflies glow like showers of gold,
and pauses, exhausted beneath the
cedars, whose fragrant boughs are
sighing in sympathy for his yearn
ing. With a feeling of utter loneli
ness he sinks to the earth, pillows his
head upon the sleeping lion and
shields himself from the sharp night
with his tawny mane. A cub nestles
at his heart and love’s brilliant star
pours its splendors upon his face;
and Adam hears, in fitful slumbers
through his dreams, ‘lt is not good
that the man should be alone.’
The First Woman.
“The slumber deepens, the winds
are hushed while love’s emblem
glows like a globe of molten gold,
and God descends, surrounded by an
angelic choir. Then comes a burst
of melody divine, and the earth trem
bles with celestial music. Suddenly
there is a moist, soft perfume upon
Adam’s cheek, sweeter than the rose
gardens of Arraby the blest. There
is a touch upon his brow softer than
the white dove’s fluttering wing;
there is a voice in his ear more sweet
and musical than Aeolian melody,
crying softly, ‘Awake, my lord,’ and
"Olja Jeffersonian
the first created man looks amazed
and enraptured upon the lustrous
eyes, the heaving bosom and the
coral lips of the mother of mankind.
“Mr. Chairman, I commend the
sound judgment of the committee in
selecting not your speaker, but the
theme, ‘Woman, the Inspiration of
the Law.’ The first glance at the
subject showed the intimate relation
ship that exists between the superior
courts and the petticoats, to say
nothing about courtship in general—
besides, I feel assured that the most
of you will bear witness to the im
portant fact that woman frequently
lays the law down to us.
“Time and time again she sees fit
to revive our judgment with a scire
facias peculiar to feminine dominion.
But, seriously speaking, mark how
the noblest conceptions of the hu
man mind have ever been present in
the form of woman. Law is typified
by a woman, blindfolded and holding
the scales of justice evenly balanced.
In referring to law in the abstract
mark again how the'feminine is used.
‘Her seat is the bosom of God; her
voice is the harmony of the world;
all things on earth and in heaven
unite to do her homage. The weak
as feeling her protecting care, and
the strong as not exempt from her
power.’
About the Bible.
“Woman is not only the inspira
tion of the law, but she is the world’s
power-house which controls every
wire in the universe. The human
trolley which moves all the wheels
of progress. Liberty itself is repre
sented by a goddess with the myrtle
entwined about her brow; the Graces
were women and the Muses, too, and
in her influence in promoting justice,
purity and truth, the grand trinity of
the legal godhead. She has glorified
the world until her beatitude be
comes divine in Mary, the mother of
God.
“All I know of the Bible, the law
of God was taught me at my mother’s
knee, and woman’s untiring devotion
and influence have done more to
teach and distribute this wonderful
book—the vital essence and embodi
ment of all law, human and divine —
than all other agencies combined. It
is found in the jungles of Africa; it
is read while crossing burning deserts
and amid Arctic snows. No ship ever
crosses the ocean without this book.
It is found in the hut of the peasant,
in the cave of the hermit, in the pal
ace of the king and in the Vatican of
the Pope. It adorns the altar where
bride and bridegroom meet to pledge
eternal love. In all the courts of
Christendom it binds the consciences
and moulds the convictions of judge
and jury in passing upon the rights
of life, liberty and property.
Woman In Literature.
“Woman is not only the inspiration
of the law, but her influence gleams
like a golden thread in the warp and
woof of all the literature of the
world. Speak of Shakespeare, and
the sublime portraits of Imogen, Ro
salind and Cordelia appear on the
mental canvas. Think of Burns, and
his Highland Mary stands before you
amidst the fragrant blossoms of the
hawthorne, and the whole world
clasps her to its bosom. Think of the
Bible and Rachel, Ruth and Rebecca
fill our souls with love and tender
ness.
“Speaking of Shakespeare and love
reminds me while in England some
years ago of my visit to the home
of the immortal bard of Avon. Not
far from Stratford, across the mea
dows, is Anne Hathaway’s cottage,
and Anne, it is said, was the only
love of the great poet. In referring
to this cottage Stoddard, who visited
the same place, says, ‘lt was the hour
of sunset as I lingered there, and
nightingales and thrushes were sing
ing in the elms and hedges as sweet
ly doubtless as they did when Shakes
peare whispered to Anne Hathaway
the story of his love.’
“What a romantic and wonderful
lover, indeed, must have been the
man who created a Romeo and an
Anthony and whose inconquerable
genius poured forth into song and
the stories of Portia, Rosalind and
Juliet. It was in the following strain
that the impassioned poet addressed
the song birds whose mating music
awoke the sleepers of the cottage;
“ ‘Would ye be taught ye feathered
throng
With love’s sweet notes to grace your
song
To pierce the heart with thrilling lay
Listen to mine Anne Hathaway.
She hath-a-way to sing so clear; *
Phoetyus might wondering stop to
hear.
To meet the sad, make blither the
gay,
And nature charm Anne hath-a-way;
She hath-a-way, Anne Ht. th away,
To breathe delight, Anne hath-a-way.’
Lost Following the Ladies.
“But I suppose you think I have
wandered from the subject of my
text; that I followed the ladies off and
got lost. Well, it’s not the first time
it has happened.
“There was never a law passed for
the purification, the upbuilding of so
ciety, or the betterment of men that
was not inspired by woman. Legis
lators may frame such laws, but they
are warmed into life and being by the
hearts of mothers, sweethearts and
wives. Man may formulate them, but
it is woman who puts salt upon the
tail of the idea, and one good, pure
woman can catch more ideas with less
salt than a dozen men in the Georgia
Legislature. Men gather the harvest,
but the seed of all good laws are
planted in the hearts of women.
“It was a woman, Aspasia, who
inspired the great Pericles to think
and act, and Theodora, not only sug
gested the Code of Justinian, but did
the last work on its completion.
“Next to God we are indebted to
woman for life itself, and then for
making life worth living.
“ ‘Disguise our bondage as we will
The law of woman rules us still.’ ”
