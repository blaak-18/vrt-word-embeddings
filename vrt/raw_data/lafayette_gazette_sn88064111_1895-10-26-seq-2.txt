The Stite Convention.
The Demcratic State Central Committee
met in New Orleans Thursd.lay. From the
iStat.s e learn that the State nominating
convention will ,e held in New Orleans on
Dec. 8.
A telegram from Judge 'Mclcery to C(,n
PIressman lloatn"r announces that he will
not be a candidate for the governor.,hip.
From all indicatious the opposition to Gov. I
Foster is going to pi:ces.
With all diue respect to Judge
McErnery isn't it about time for him
to quit running for governor ?
It appears that the City Item,
O'Malley's paper, is leading the I
fight against Foster.
The claim that the nomination of t
Judge McEnery will unify the party
is the rankest political rot of the sea
bOn.
How can those gentlemen in La- t
fayette who are so violently opposed I,
to third terms support Gov. Mc- c
Enery? ?
O'Malley, Adams, Butler, Par- C
ker & Co. are leading the reform s'
movement in New Orleans. It P
would be a good idea to begin by
reformilng the reformers. c.
To hear such old-timners as Gabe h
r!ontegut, Jonas, Steele, and others i
talk about "rings" and '"machine t
p:clitics" is enough to give the hys- tl
terics to a plantation mule.
Judge Mclcnery is compared to b
Cincinnatls. It was the general o
impression that Capt. Adams had a a
uonopoly of that part of the busi
iless. I
More work is expected of an I
editor for less money than allny
other calling on earth. And still "
sbome people imagine that all a tl
newspaper tman has to do is to live T'
on the fat of the land and have a it
good time as long as his mortal fe
coil remains as one of the things b1
that live.-St. Mary Optic. thi
A hoile tiut/ful paragraplh was
never written. It is taken front
The Desr:to Democrat-Journal :
Wh\'en a poor loan steals, even Ica
if thie aouott be small and hisc
necessities great, he generally hat th
to stiffer the penalty attached to on
his crime. The same rule does ni<
not apply in the case of the rich kt
man. If he makes judicious use of
his ill-gotten gains in the selection pe
of his attorneys he goes scott free. ag
The Journal has never taken any thl
stock in the talk about a third term
for Grover Cleveland. There is no
doubt but that Grover is warmly in ua
love with himself and the White i
House. Having been selected three le
times in succession as the candidate
for his pa ty for president, he has to
persuatll.d himoself that he is ab- ti
solutely indispensible to party suc- nu
ces, and he is alw Zvs. ready, to be
sacrificed. If asked the question.
"VWho is the greatest ]man on an
earth !" lie woutild probably say. en,
"Modesty interdict a peronal an-11 m
swer."-Knoxville Journal. Th
There are 3,890 convicts in the an
Texas penitentiary and not one on,
printer or newspaperman ani-ng fal
themn, while there are a numler of thc
?inisters, doctors, bankers, lawyers, ty
photogiraphers and members of all It
tihe profes ions and callings, and! ha'
yet goody-goody folks give the I'
average printer a bad name. T e tcr
nature of the "art-preservative" pa'.
teaches the printer to detest hypoc- wi
risy, and probably for this reason teC
he is generally considered a 'tough ri ';
character." Trhere are said to) be fri
very few printers in hell, but it is S
doubtful if any who have run coun- Ct
try papers ever reach hIeaven. 1
A funny man who asked the ques- nia
tion, "*Where is thie State of Matri- he
mony ?" ieceiv-ed the following an- drce
scwer, says a contcmlporary: 'It i: su·ti
one of the United Statsc; it is dis;

and kissing, and cradles anid l'.tCies hin

,A If' uLL " G OO1)
The speakers at the McEacry
AY meeting held in New Orleans Tues
day night all agreed on one point,
rot:. which is, that the administration of
Gov. Foster was clean and free
from all scandals, and that the
-on chief executive limself is an excel
lent gentlentan, able and honest;
but they have one objection to him.
They do not like his associates.
They have become so pure and the
S spirit of reform has so completely
n taken possession of their souls that
ts..s
and the mnan hinmself must not only be
pure, but his associates must be
tree above r;'- roach. They do not con
the sider John Fitzpatrick and the other :
ing ward Icade s as good company and
they object to Gov. Foster because
"M- he has been so unfortunate as to
hip. have won to his support these gen- 1
Uv. tle-nen whose besetting sin seems to
be that they are "ward leaders."
Ige i Such pure and immaculate gentle- t
im men as Gabe Montegut, B. F. Jo- c
nas, C. J. Boatner, can not bear the
im, sight of "'war-d leaders." They !
the have suddenly reached such a de- t
gree of perfection that they will ac- r
of tually oppose Gov. Foster because 1
t his association is not up to the c
ta- standard of the very recent advo- f
cates of reform !
When it is taken in consideration L
-a- that John Fitzpatrick and the other d
ctd leaders were three years ago the h
[c- closest friends of these same self- g
anointed gentlemen their hypocriti- tl
:r- cal protest against their former as- tl
rm sociates is about the most amusing a
It piece of political comedy of the age. i
Hy Have these new converts to the
cause of political purity been quietly S
attending some "reform school" or
be have they been secretly undergoing d
rs some process of purification by h
ve which they have been cleansed of
their old time sinfulness, for accor
ding to the new code it is sinful to
to be on good terms with "bosses" and
-al outrageously wicked to belong to
aa ''ring." q
'- Though they are 1rincipally re- o
slponsilde for the election of Mayor ti
n Iitzi;atrick and the other municipal .
y oficers, they will not forgive (ov. e
ill I o:;ter for acce)pting support from tl
a the city ad: inistration's forces. p
he The will nut even alow the gover- tl
a nor the priv loge of exchanlging art
tl few words with them as they pas:. tr
s by. There must be a gulf between \
themn as wide as the contincut and .,
as deep as the ocean.
S itzpatrick and ]lrewster are old ia
MtIcn:ery men and while trying to al
cast odium on the governor by 11
Scharging a conmbination with the.m,
the present leaders of the A!cl'cr y ;
Smnovnement are certainly not ctoltplii- I
nmienting themselves, as i iis a well
w known fact that it is the MlcEnery e,
n people who elected Mr. Fitzpatrick 10o
against Mr. Jos. A. Shakespere who ec
was no'ninate:l an I supported Ii ,
a the friends of (;Go\. Foster.
iThere are so many Keeley grad- be

hat N. O. States.
be Now that is all very fine; but
be none of us before have heard of the
on- gravity of this crisis. A great
her many people have for some time
Lld past been seeking to organize an
use opposition to Gov. Foster's nomin
to ation for reelection; but that op
en- position has been chiefly based on
to dissatisfaction with some of his ap
s." pointments, and not on the assump
le- tion that the State is in the throes
Jo- of dissolution.
the rWe do not knowv on what
ey grounds the opposition will at
ic- tempt to assault Gov. Foster. The
ac- report, at one time generally be- I
use lieved, that he had entered into a
the combine to turn over this city for
6o- four years longer to the Ring, that
has so abused its own interests, has
on been dissipated, and there is no
ter doubt that the Goevrnor will use all
he his power and influence to secure a
if- good and efficient government for
ti- this city. Under his administration
is- the finances of the State have b, en
ng admirably managed ; the revenues
Ce. increased; part of the debt retired,
he and all the public institutions of the
ly State improved in their condition,
or and some them of enlarged. In
ng deed, Gov. Foster's anministration
by has been closely identified with the
of prosperity and progress of the State, (
r and as a clean, efficient and pro
to gressive administration it is ab
Id solutely unassailable. c
to 1We are quite moved by the elo- t
quent appeal of Judge G unby to the i
e- opposition to Foster to rally around
or tihe standard of Judge McEncry and
pal sa-e the State. Our emotions are
'- especially excited by the fact that
m the judge has done his level best to
- precipitate any crisis in the fate of
the Democratic party that nmay lbe
a really impending. lut we are not
trustful of the MIonr.oe Cassandra.
-\V We reinmtmber that three years ano
', she lifted up her voice in lprop- cy
and woe throug':ouit North L.ouis
d iana, predicting the ruin. miserrya
toand debacucher;- that would surelyi
?Y iow front the election of Judge
", 'IcE:ery over ?M. J. Foster; while
site thrcatcnend in case suc:ii a ca
i- lanity should befall L.clisiana to tdo
1 a deed that woiul., had s.;e perfect
Y ed it, have caused her to be han.ged
k long since for infanticide. W\e sin
0 cerely hope the able editor of the
Y Bulletin will keep his shirt on and
not let his patriotic feelings get the
1- better of his sounder judgment.
s In this campaign we want no vitu
,t peration, no niurder, no bloodshed.
If W\e want only results that will per
n petuate the power of the Democrat
ic party in Louisiana and bring
e about a thorough reform in our
municipal government, and these
needs we are quite sure will be fully
attained by the re-election of Gov.
' Foster.
For Judge MIcEnery we have the
e profoundest respect. lie is our
lpersonal and political friend, and
t has been for nearly twenty vears.
Itad he not so persistently and
positively dleclined to be a candi
ilate in this campaign it would have
tgiven us pleasure to support himi.
But his declination was so emphatic
k :that many of his friends thought
'proper to make other alliances an i
p!edges; and in all honor they are
bound and will resolutely stand to
'their obligations thus assumed.
SJutdge Mcl'Enery would make, as he
has madle before, a wise and able
Chief Executive of the State. Biut
we have the fruits of Gov. Foster's
administration before our eyes, and
they seem to us to be entirely good,
and we see no reason why he should
not be trusted by the Democracy of
Sthis State, which he has so faithful
ly served in a great crisis of its fate
less than two years ago with another
ternt of office. Nothing can be
said of the Democracy of any man
in Louisiana, or of the fidelity of
any man in Louiisiana to the trust
confided to him, that cannot be
snaid as truthfully andl as earnestly
