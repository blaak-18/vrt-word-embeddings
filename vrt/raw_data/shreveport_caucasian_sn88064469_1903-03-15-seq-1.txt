ANNUAL REUNION IN NEW OR
LEANS IN MAY.
Information of General Interest to the
Boys in Gray-Elaborate Prep
arations to Be Made.
New Orleans. March 14.-New Or
leans has determined that the Annual
Reunion of the United Confederate Vet
erans, which will take place in the Cres
cent City May 19, 20, 21 and 22 shall be
the most momentous gathering of the
"old soldier boys held during the past
decade.
Representing, as it does, possibly the
most attractive point in the great South,
it is consequently dear to the hearts of
the men who fought and bled during
those trying times forty odd years ago.
The Southern metropolis stands for,
possibly, the greatest aggregate import
ance, financially and socially in a won
derfully prosperous South. It witnessed
its homes depleted of thousands of brave
souls who left their families and their
belongings to take up arms in a cause
for which they were ready to sacrifice
everything most dear. Thousands went;
thousands remained away; and, the ones
who returned to take up the burdens
they had dropped at the first call, and
who have survived the vicissitudes of
fortune and of fate during the long in
terim, stand with open arms ready to
welcome to their homes and to their
lasting affections their brothers who had
stood "on the line' amid the storm and
fury which marked the awful battles of
the civil war.
Because of these memories, and be
cause of the associations which began
near a half century since and which
have been kept alive by the fires of a pa
triotic sentiment the old soldiers of the
Crescent City are determin'ed to make
the welcome they will accord their one
time companions the warmest on re
cord. And in this they will be supported
and assisted by every man, woman, a n
idbthe iV t city Neotw Orleaaa ,.a~ '.
wlth wilt anxioausy count the days an
i! they can number the entire host of
old Confederate Veterans as their loved
and honored guests.
The material side of the reception to
the United Confederate Veterans is rap
idly assuming a definite and tangible
fans. Realizing the importance of mak
ing the reunion a red letter occasion in
the annals of these survivors of the
Confederacy, New Orleans has deter
mined to raise a fund of $soo,ooo which
will be Vpended in providing adequate
entertaiedment, both of body and of
mind . during the several days of the
convention.
A large number of committees have
been appointed under the supervision
and direction cf the Confederate camps
in New Orleans and of Louisiana, and
these committees are hard at work en
deavoring to l rfect the details of the
reunion.
In an interview with Colonel J. A.
Harral, aide-de-camp on the staff of
General John B. Gordon and chairman
of the press committee, a committee
composed of the newspir men of the
city, it was demonstrated that the en
tire situation has been carefully consid
ered and that the local forces are mov
ihg quietly yet rapidly in an aggregate
effort ,to the end that nothing may be
fopnd wanting when the dawn of the
reunion heralds the arrival of the old
gray-clad heroes.
From Colonel Harral it is learned
that the railroads centering in New Or
leans are making every . arrangement
necessary for the liandling of the mem
bers of the x5oo camps which comprise
the entire organization of the Veterans.
The rates will be made low enough to
prove an incentive to even the most
[umble of the old "Vets," who will find
this ,feature no impediment in his de
sire to reach the convention.
The committee on' accommodations
have arranged for a' system of room
listing which, in addition, to the accom
nwodation provided by the hotels, will
enable the visitors to be taken care of
without the annoying waits so frequent
ott aeasions of the 1end under consid
eratios
At feast ten thousand rooms will be
registered with the several "information
bureaus" proided for the purpose, and
the comtnittee has definite assurance
that the rates for board and lodging
will be very reasonable.
pra~ nts. hve been made,
through the ki dness of the United
tates goverany ocials, for a large
umber aet army tets which will be

I' the erection of an in mmnnce dinin 1
hall and series of kitchens where mtentls
v: ill be provided. for the attendants on
the convention, at low prices.
Plans have been prepared for the
convention auditorium which will he
erected at the fair grounds, and work
upon this building will he begun with
itg the next ten days.
The- auditorium will he of sufficient
size to accommodate the esm mated min
her of Veterans, and the conveniences
will be so arranged as to enalbe those
uresent to keep closely in touch with the
speakers and the proceedings.
Elaborate plans have been made for
the entertainment of the Veterans, and,
in addition to competitive drils and
military parades in which a number of
companies from other states will par
ticipate, a grand ball will be given dur
ing the convention.
The committee on reception will pro
vide a simple method of registration,
showing name, company and residence.
which will be open to' the public. It is
desired that every attendant upon the
convention take advantage of this fact
in order to simplify matters for the
various committees having their comfort
at interest.
Bureaus of information will be estab
lished both in the city and at the fair
grounds, by means of which the thous
ands of visitors will be enabled to se
cure information, no matter upon what
subject.
There will also be established at the
fair grounds a sub-mailing station or
postoffice at which mail may be posted,
stamps purchased and mail distributed.
This sub-station will be under the su
pervision of the United States postal
authorities, and, with an adequate force
of expert mail men, will undoubtedly
be a. very attractive feature of the gath
ering.
The committee on hotels and accom-1
modations will shortly prepare a circu
Iar letter to be addressed to each of the
5S5 United Confederate Veteran camps
of the United States, soliciting informa
tio which may' enable the committee,
as sop as possible, to determine the ap
jsrwiute :nmbe. ,of old soldiers who
will attend the reunion.
This will undoubtedly lessen the work
of the committee, and work to the bene
fit of the visitors. It is expected that a
large number of newspaper men from
the newspapers of the United States will
be present during the reunion, and it is
hoped that . the local papers and the
country press of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Texas and other states of the South
may find it convenient to attend.
In order to facilitate the work of the
press, especial arrangements will be
made for their convenience and enter
tainment.
The rooms of the New Orleans Pro
gressive Union, 311 Baronne street, will
be made permanent headquarters of the
press committee and of the press at
large.
Owing to its location and the conven
iences which the rooms of the Progres
sive Union offer, there is little doubt
but that the location will be one of
great interest to the visiting newspaper
men and will greatly facilitate their
work.
A special reception to the members
of the press will be given in the rooms
of the Progressive Union during one
day of the convention. Through the
kindness of the New Orleans Railway
Company, cars have been secured for a
ride on the St. Charles avenue and Tu
lane avenue belts, under the auspices of
the local newspaper committee.
All visiting newspaper men are urged
to register at the rooms of the Pro
gressive Union immediately upon arrival
in the city in order that adequate ar
rangements may be made for their en
tertainment and well-being.
The St. Charles hotel has been deter
mined upon as the location of the gen
eral United Confederate Veterans head
quarters, and the various sponsors of
the visiting camps will be domiciled here'
also.
The Confederate Southern Memorial
Association will hold its fourth annual
convention at New Orleans on same
date as the United Confederate Veter
ana. The opening feature will be the
usual Jefferson Davis memorial service,
which will be held at Christ Church
cathedral on Tuesday, May 19, at To
a.m. The commander-in-chief, depart
ment and state commanders, with their
respective staffs, and Confederate Vet
erans in general, are cordially invited to
assist at this solemn and impressive cer
emony, in memory of the first and only
president of the Southern Confederacy.
The tremendous enthusiasm of the
people of New Orleans in regard to this
coming resaiop makes it beyond perad
srentre that the occasion will be moct

BATSON GUILTY.
The second trial of A. E. Batson at
Lake Charles has ended in his convic
tion of the murder of the Earl family
near Welsh. On the first trial he was
convicted as charged, but secured a new
trial on technicalities. There were, as
usual throughout the State, the senti
mental class who did- not think he was
guilty. At any rate he has been convict
ed and will hang-hang did we say? Oh,
no, hanging legally would break his neck
and-cause -his death. Hie wif take the
"more severe' penalty of life imprison
metit which he doubtless will secure.
What is needed in Louisiana as much as

As to the highest stage to be expected
in the vicinity of Shreveport much still
depends upon the weather of the com

I ), 1Icrate and Per i itenit NWs Her Pur
pose--An Admission of uiuilk
and a C'ottradictio't.
There is in the custody of the sheriff
a: man. Mrs. J. C. Bullock. who is
ct r''w with the murder of her hus
land. T. J. Bullock, a man over fifty
sears of age, who died at his It me on
Franklin _treet yesterday afternoon be
twecn 3 and 4 o'clock.
The recital of the facts notw le alihre
eiated from all sensation. It is a pitiful
case-pitiful because the children of this
couple are the sufferers. und their ages
range from the small tot to a splendid,
good faced, hard working young man
who has recently reached his maturity
and is married. And there is also a
grown daughter, living in Kansas City.
Mo., and the others are in their teens.
For some time T. J. Bullock has been
sick. Under the tratment of his physi
cians he improved, but relapsed, with
complications. On being questioned, Mrs.
Bullock admitted having given him
croton oil, in small doses, and ground
glass in capsules. This admission she
contradicted afterwards and explained
that the croton oil was administered un
der the advise of a friend to soothe her
husband in his slumbers. Certainly she
did not know the effect of croton oil.
This woman is either insane or one of
the most devilish of her kind. The scene
which occurred at the home of the fam
ily on Franklin street when the officers
conveyed her away baffles description.
Her children, not realizing their situa
tion, cried pitifully. Her son followed
her to the court house with her young
child, who shuddered with lamentations
at the very thought of his mother being
locked up in the jail. It was a sad sight,
sad indeed. The woman realizes her pre
dicament and now and then her par
oxysms indicated that she was being
moved bye great emotion concealed and
restrained with all the power at her
command.
T. J. Bullock and family came to
Shreveport from Logansport about four
years age akd at one time kept a bdcrd
ing house at the Junction.

Warrant for Two Thousand Dollars for
His Insurance.
The reporter of Alpha Lodge No.
25oW, Knights of Honor, received yester
day from Noah M. Givan, supreme re
porter, a warrant for $2000, being in
favor of Mrs. D. B. Doyle, whose hus
band, a member of the lodge, died
at his home in this city on January 2p,
1903. The widow having moved to Illi
nois, the warrant was returned, but she
will be paid the amount at her residence
through the Knights of Honor. This is
a quick settlement, but it is in keeping
with the promptness and the reliability
of this, one of the best fraternal institu
tions, through which thousands of wid
ows and orphans have been relieved and
provided for.
