We need an Andrew Jackson in
the White House just about now.
In his day, when engaged in a war
with banks and money sharks he
said: "By the Eternal, we will
see which is to rule, the money
power or the people." If Jackson
lived to-day he would be a "crank"
and an "anarchist" in the eyes of
the plutocrats.-lndelwpedent.
