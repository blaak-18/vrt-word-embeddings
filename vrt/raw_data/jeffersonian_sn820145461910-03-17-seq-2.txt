ARE WE BECOMING A NATION
OF SNOBS?
Wittingly or otherwise, the daily
papers of the United States are en
couraging the great army of readers
to become an army of snobs.
Time was when the proud boast
of every citizen of the United States
was, with the educational advan
tages offered, every man w r as the
equal of his neighbor.
Money didn’t cut so much ice; the
vulgar display of great wealth was
rated as vulgar display, and nothing
more.
It is hard to tell what induced
the change in the people of the Uni
ted States.
It may have come with the “high
er education” which sent our girls
and young men abroad, where they
first absorbed the longings for titles
and the manners and vices of the so
called “nobility.”
To this great class of wealthy
Americans was attracted an equally
large class of foreigners who needed
the money.
With their artificiality of living it
was an easy matter for the children
of the new-rich to become identified
with the mode, and the rest is his
tory. Scarcely a day goes by that
the marriage of rich young women
of the United States is not recorded
more or less fulsomely by the press,
and the divorces and domestic trou
bles of other rich young women who
have gone before, are just as popu
lar daily features.
When a young man who has noth
ing to recommend him but his name
(made more or less famous prob
ably by his father), marries a young
woman whose only distinguishing
feature seems to be poverty, the
great press of the United States, al
most to a unit, turns handsprings
of astonishment and rains gobs of
ink all over its front page to an
nounce “Secretary's sou marries
poor young woman!” And the sec
retary (whose proud boast in pre
election days was that he came of
the people, whom he was most anx
ious to serve), waxes wroth and
turns the son out to shift for him
self.
This is probably the very best
thing that could happen to the
young man, but what is there re
markable about an ordinary young
man choosing to marry an ordinary
young woman? Thia is where th®
press steps in and all the bromedian
expressions are hauled from the type
box, and the young woman of “poor,
but honest, parentage,” is held up
for inspection.
The parents of the young man are
commiserated; his career is "spoil
ed.” The “designing” young woman
is made to appear a* more or less of
a siren of mature years who has skil
fully “roped in” the unsuspecting
young man, and so on.
The chances are very largely in
favor of the girl needing all the sym
pathy that may be floating around
loose. Unless the young man de
velops some hitherto unknown traits,
the young woman will be taking in
washing, or “back to the ribbon
counter” will be her lot.
When the rich young woman mar
ries a little foreign monkey of a
man, the same press, with on® ac
cord, will spout ink rhapsodies, and
everything from the bride’s slippers
to the half-smoked cigarette th©
groom throws away will come in for
descriptive photographs.
And the lack of money in one case,
with the possession of it in another,
is the only ground on which to base
the difference of the newspaper atti
tude.
If this isn’t snobbishness, pure and
decidely simple, what is it?
And isn’t it time Americans of the
U. S. A. “cut it out?”
We have howled long and loud of
our independence and our democracy,
but we are decidedly below’ par on
our possession of these traits.
Let’s have a little more democracy,
less apology for the “poor but hon
est” young people who are really the
backbone of our nation, and there
will be less bartering of our daugh
ters by foreign snobs whose moth
eaten titles are, in the end, most ex
pensive and unsatisfactory assets.

Lo, the poor Indian, doesn’t seem

With the certain value of all those

The South needs emigrants, and
needs them badly, but it is to be
hoped she will discriminate a trifle
and not let the bars down for the
riff-raff and scum which are making
the Northern States lead in criminal
percentage. The bids for American
settlers should be made strong
enough to induce this desirable class
to come as settlers. Canada is steadi
ly drawing the brawn of the North
west, and there is need of Ameri
cans in the South.
New Yorkers are just beginning to
settle down to thorough enjoyment of
their mayor; for the first time in
years a man who is fearless and hon

don’t know whether they like it or
not.

The Philadelphia labor strike
doesn’t seem to be proving anything
excepting that organized labor isn’t

From wearing dresses that made

The consensus of opinion seems to
be that New Yorkers, “by and large,”
are a very rude lot, and the New

it even before F. Hopkinson Smith
told them so. But as F. Hopkinson

press, he isn’t sorry he mentioned
the matter.

Wouldn’t it be nice within a week or
so to begin to say goodbye forever to
the scalding, dribbling, straining, or
too frequent passage of urine; the fore
head and the back-of-the-head aches;
the stitches and pains in the back; the
growing muscle weakness; spots before
the eyes; yellow skin; sluggish bow
els; swollen eyelids or ankles; leg
cramps; unnatural short breath; sleep
lessness and the despondency?
I have a recipe for these troubles
that you can depend on, and if you
want to make a quick recovery, you
ought to write and get a copy of it.
Many a doctor would charge you $3.50
just for writing this prescription, but I
have it and will be glad to send it to
you entirely free. Just drop me a line
like this: Dr. A. E. Robinson, R 667
Luck Building, Detroit, Mich., and I
will send it by return mail in a plain
envelope. As you will see when you
get it, this recipe contains only pure,
harmless remedies, but it has great
healing and pain-conquering power.
It will quickly show its power once

send you a copy free—you can use it
and cure yourself at home.
