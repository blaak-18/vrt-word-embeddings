Summary of Ebents as They Happen
"By Tom Dolan
Prince Ferdinand, o£ Bulgaria, has
proclaimed his country independent
of Turkey, which has for thirty years
held nominal sway over it. Austria-
Hungary immediately seized upon the
changed status of affairs to declare
the minor dependencies of Herze
govina and Bosnia annexed to that
government. The conditions are very
unsettled and not in many years has
the Eastern question presented so
many complications; yet war will
hardly result, as it is manifestly to
the interests of all concerned to main
tain the peace.
The State election was one of the
quietest in history and Joseph M.
Brown is now Governor-elect by a
tremendous majority.
The constitutionality of the Wise
law, which provides that S2OO must
be paid for a license to sell “near
beer” has been upheld by Judge El
lis, of the Superior Court. While the
revenue arising’ from such licenses
not be so great as was believed,
iv fund will be raised with which to
meet the expenses of putting into op
eration the new convict system after
April, 1909. The Prison Commission
ers will advertise for bids upon farms
and get in readiness to care for all
convicts who are not required, or
taken, for use on the public roads, as
well as for infirm and women offend
ers.
“Victor Rosewater must have
sworn in several tongues and dialects
when one of his bright young men
jumped on a plank of the Republican
platform under the delusion that it
was an extract from one of Bryan’s
speeches,” says the Atlanta Georgian.
Yet why censure the “bright young
man”? It would take a chart, a com
pass and a very ancient mariner in
deed, to detect any difference between
the platforms of the two parties or
the speeches of their leaders. The
day of the “old war horse” is over
and in his stead there ramps upon
the political stage the Buster Brown
private secretary type, astride a Big
Stick and equipped with a card in
dex. The people have proven so gul
lible these many years that talent is
wasted —hence the graphophone, tfre
phonograph, the typewriter and any
other old machine is deemed sufficient
to satisfy all campaign purposes.
With platforms alike, nominees both
weakly aping “my policies” and
stereotyped oratory of the same
brand, what wonder that a bewildered
young clerk should get all balled up?

T.' my tests which hake been
a part of Roosevelt’s
die service are being made
a ,els rather sorry for the of-
ficers who are being put through their
paces. It may be all right, of course,
to judge a man’s military fitness by
the number of miles he can ride on
horseback without exhaustion, or the
amount of walking, lifting, and other
physical feats he can perform, but so
far as history goes to show, it has
been the quality of grey matter rath
er than the heft of the body which
has counted in the direction of great
battles and the making of history.
Mr. Roosevelt, being himself of the
“husky” type, seems inclined to ex
alt mere brawn, forgetting that there
is an electrical energy and a subtle
of endurance often characteris

> i Bryan mot and dined to
gether a banquet given during the
D'eep Waterways Convention in Chi
cago. With platforms and purposes
so similar, it is a pity the two are
not running mates. Sherman and
Kern seem so superfluous in the light
of common sense. The two fat twins,
Bryan and Taft, grinning at each oth
er over the terrapin, are an impress
ive spectacle, and one can see them
nudge each other and whisper:
“Shall the rulers fool?” “The rul
ers do fool,” which phrases, as every
one knows, are the slogans of the cam
paign.
The Rev. S. Edward Young, pastor
of the Second Presbyterian Church of
Pittsburg, recently received a call to
another church, whereupon his own
congregation voted him a raise of
$3,000 if he would remain, which he
refused, stating:
“I will remain with my people, if
they need me so badly, but I will not
accept the additional salary.”
Here, at last, is something good
to come out of Pittsburg. Would
there were more pastors like him.
While it is true that the salary of
$7,000 he is now receiving is a sub
stantial one and would seem enor
mous to many struggling ministers,
yet the principle upon which he de
clined to take any more is a noble
one. A city pastor has many calls
upon his purse and doubtless Mr.
Young is of the type of preacher whp
tries to go about doing good, often at
his own heavy expense. Therefore,
his refusal to tax his people any
Atlanta, Ga., Thursday, October 15, 1908
more, instead of satisfying his con
science on the idea that he could “in
crease his usefulness” by taking the
additional fee, shows a fine integrity.
If more preachers would resolutely set
their faces against investments in
church real estate, waste of money
on expensive buildings and elaborate
furn ishings, high-priced singers and
the other appurtenances of latter-day
church work, and take a self-denying
stand themselves, while encouraging
their parishioners in doing substantial
good, what a mighty stride forward
the Church would make.
The United States fleet has been
at Manila, but owing to the cholera
which rages in that city, very little
has been done in celebration of the
event. The marines are kept in pret
ty closely and every precaution has
been taken to prevent any case of the
plague breaking out on board the
fleet.
Educational institutions in the
South are to receive $2,500,000, con
stituting the principal of the George
Peabody fund set aside for such pur
pose. Heretofore they have received
only the income from the amount.
For the past two weeks members of
the interstate commerce commission
have been hearing the question of
freight rates. It will be remembered
that the injunction of Judge Speer
against the increase in rates was su
perseded by an order from Judge
Pardee, permitting them to go into ef
fect. It is now being argued that
Judge Pardee was without the juris
diction of .his circuit at the time he
signed the order, for which reason it
should be void and the rates, there
fore, put back on the old basis. If.
it is found that Judge Pardee had no
right to grant the order as he did, the
recently advanced rates will be re
duced so far as this State is con
cerned, and this long before the ques
tion of the “reasonableness” of the
increased rates could possibly be
threshed out before the commission.
Prohibition of the manufacture of
absinthe, in Switzerland, will not go
into effect for nearly two years.
Meantime; it is being made in whole
sale quantities to fill large orders
which have come in as a result of the
necessity felt by dealers in this pale
green, anise flavored beverage, to lay
in a store of it in advance.
President Roosevelt has decided
not to take the stump.
Johannesburg, South Africa, is cop
ing with the race problem in a desper
ate form. Roving bands of black na
tives in that vicinity are almost be

Thomas W. Lawson, famous author
of ■’Frenzied Finance” has been
seriously hurt in a runaway.
That emotional lady who burst into
sobs because Mrs. Roosevelt
ed a kiss upon the cheek of her six
weeks-old baby is evidently no be
liever in the terrors of Osculation.
Incidentally, with all respect to the
first lady of the land, one wonders
what kind of a fit might have been
thrown had a real live queen been
equally attentive to the infant. There
are some incidents which savor very
much of slush-gush.
The first woman to hold public
office in New Jersey is a Mrs. Wil
liam C. Eakins, who has just been
elected to the position of school
trustee in Kearney, New’ Jersey.
Another Woman and a man were her
opponents in the contest which
resulted in an overwhelming victory
for Mrs. Eakins.
Sidney Tapp, of the Atlanta bar,
has just organized a new political
party to be known as the “Liberals,”
and has been nominated for the pres
idency. Thus another Georgia son

The old McKinley home, at Canton,
Ohio, has been purchased for use as
a hospital. At Mrs. McKinley’s death
the historic place was tenantless,
there being no direct heir. It is a
plain, two-story frame dwelling, sit
ting upon a quiet street. The famous
lawn is but a few yards square and
the “front porch” just what its name
implies—an entirely different thing
from the spacious verandas with
which most of our Southern homes are
adorned.
The International Congress on Tu
berculosis, after a several weeks’ ses
sion in Washington, D. C., has roused
the world to the necessity of com
batting this plague, by which, accord
ing to statistics, millions now living
are doomed. The means to be used
are not drugs nor patent cures, but
fresh air, good food and cleanliness.
