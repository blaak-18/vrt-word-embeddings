WILD OATS.
PROSPECTUS FOR 1875.
Champion American Comic Paper!
Illustrated by a corps of the best Ameri
can artists, and contributed to by the
miost popular humorists and satirists of
the day.
Wild Oats now enters successfully up
on the sixth year of its existence, and
has become the established humorous and
satirical paper of the country. It was
started and continued the first year as a
monthly, then, to satistfy the demand of
the public, it was changed to a fortnight.
ly. Still continuing its good work of
hitting folly as it flies, and showing up
the political and social shams by its
masterly cartoons and pungent editorials,
it achieved even greater success than
before, and was recognized as the ablest
and brightest of its class. Since then we
have yielded still further to the public
demand, and now publish Wild Oats
weekly! It has literally grown into its
present shape on its intrinsic merits, be
ing the first successful weekly hnmorous
paper ever published in this country.
Among the artists especially engaged
to fnrnish illustrations for Wild Oats are
Frank Bellew, Thomas Worth Hopkins,
Wales, Shelton, Wolf, Jump, Keettols,
Stnckhardt, Day, Poland, and several
others who are yet known to fame.
In its literary departments Wild Oats
will, as it always has, stand alone and
unapproachable. At least one first-class
serial story will always be found in its
pages, by the best lhumorous, satirical,
and character writers in the United
States; while its sketches and squibs
will be sparkling, original and pointed.
Wild Oats will be first-class in every
particular, and on this account may be
taken into the best families without fear
or suspicion, as no word or illustration
will appear that can offend the most fas
tidions.

Dr. J. Walker's California
Vinegar Bitters are a purely Veg
etable preparation, made chiefly from
the native herbs found on the lower
ranges of the Sierra Nevada moun
tains of California, the medicinal
properties of which are extracted
therefrom without the use of Alcohol.
The question is Almost daily asked,
" What is the cause of the unpar
alleled success of VINEGAR BIT
rETRs f" Our answer is, that they
remove the cause of disease, and
the patient recovers his health. They
are the great blood purifier and a
life-giving principle, a perfect Reno
vator and Invigorator of the system.
Never before in the history of the world
has a medicine been compounded pos
sessing the remarkable qualities of Tnr
EoAR BITTERs in healing the sick of
every disease man is heir to. They are
a gentle Purgative as well as a Tonic,
relieving Congestion or Inflammation of
the Liver and Visceral Organs, in Bilious
Diiseases.
The properties of Dn. WALK
nR's VINEGAR B ITTr s are Aperient, Dia
phoretic, Carminative, Nutritious, Laxa
tive, Diuretic, Sedative, Counter.Irritant,
Sudorific, Alterative, and Anti-Bilious..

Summer and Aitumn, and remarka

heat and dryness, are invariably ac
companied by extensive derange
ments of the stomach and liver, and
other albdominal viscera.- In their
treatment, a purgative, exerting a
powerful influence upon these vari
ous organs, is essentially necessary.
There is no cathartic for the purpose
equal to Dit. J. WALKER'S VINEGAR

the dark-colored viscid inattcr with which
the bowels are loaded, at the same time
