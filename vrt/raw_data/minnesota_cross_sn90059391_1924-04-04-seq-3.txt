The Twelfth Chapter of Romans
As A Klansman’s Law of Life
(EDITOR’S NOTE —This lx the sub
stance of a sermon delivered bj Rev.
W. C. Wrlfht, of Plalnvlew. Texas,
on the principles of Klankraft as set
forth In this wonderful scripture.)
THE twelfth chapter of Romans
contains more oi the fundamen
al teachings of Christ, and more
of the practical rules for Christian
living than any other one chapter in
the whole Bible. Klansmen have
adopted it as their Law of Life be
cause it presents so many of the
sacred principles which the Klan
seeks to inculcate ,and so beautifully
portrays the sublime characteristics
of our Criterion of Character.
Prof. Drummond, in his wonderful
essay on “the greatest thing in the
world,” passes the thirteenth chap
ter of First Corinthians through the
prism of reason, as it were, and
separtes “love” into its component
parts, showing the ingredients that
enter into its composition. Let us
analize the Klansman’s Law of Life
in this way and note the pleasing
results.
Terse One
“I beseech you therefore, brethren,
by the mercies of God, that you pre
aent your bodies a living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable unto God, which Is
your reasonable service.”
By this we are reminded that we
are "brethren,” not only in a com
mon cause, but by racial blood as
well. Our attention is also directed
to "the mercies of God,” which we
too often forget and fail to recognize
and appreciate. We are also com
manded to make a tremendous sacri
fice, "our bodies.” The Jews had
long been accustomed to offer as
sacrifices the dead bodies of animals;
but the apoetle here demands that
we offer “our own bodies," as a
“living” sacrifice. This was the
supreme test. Man thinks more of
his body than anything else he
Eossesses. He will gladly give up
onor, glory, reputation, character,
friends, wealth, and even his own
aoul, to save his body. The soul
may be sin-sick, and nearing the
portals of eternal death; but he is
not alarmed, nor does he call in the
Great Physician to heal the malady.
But let the body become sick and
endangered, and he calls a human
physician, post-haste, and utilizes
every available means to secure re
lief.
To lay our "bodies,” yet “living,
on the altar of service, is the supreme
sacrifice. We are further informed
that this “living sacrifice," our
bodies, must be "holy, acceptable
unto God.” This demands a clean,
consecrated life. God will not ac
cept an unholy offering. But the
apostle very modestly declares that
this is just our "reasonable service."
Verse Two
“And be not conformed to this
world; but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye prove
what is that good, and acceptable,

and perfect will of God.”
Here we are warned not to be
fashioned after this world, not to
live worldly lives, but to be "trans
formed,” or changed, by a renewal
or change of mind, or heart. Thus
we become “new creatures." The
reason for this change is given:
“that you may prove (or show) what
is that ‘good,’ and ‘acceptable,’ and
‘perfect’ will of God."
As Klansmen, we should be so
transformed, or different from the
world, that our lives will prove
what is the will of God. Let God
show his perfect will through ui to
others.
"For I say, through the grace glv.
cn unto me, to every man among you,
not to think himself more highly
than he ought to think; but to think
soberly, according as God has dealt
to every man the measure of faith.”
Aside from the grateful acknowl
edgement of God’s rich grace, to
which we are all indebted, this
verse teaches us to think seriously,
to be modest and unassuming. Self
boasting, self-conceit, pride, arro
gance and over-confidence are wholly
excluded. We are warned not to
over-estimate ourselves; .but to be
governed by the measure of our
faith. A Klansman should think and
act with becoming modesty in all
things.
Verses Four and Five
“For as we have many members in
one body, and all members have not
the same office; so we, being many,
are one body In Christ, and everyone
members one of another,”
The human body is composed of
many members, hands, feet, eyes,
ears, nose, heart, lungs, but all
members do not perform the same
work; yet each one of them is vitally
essential. It takes all of them to
make up the one body. This is per
fectly clear.
So the apostle reasons that there
are many members (Christians) in
the body of Christ (the Church);
and that every one is “members one
of another,” is vitally connected and
indispensible. We form one perfect
whole. So it is with the Klankraft,
there are many Klansmen in the
body; they do not perform the same
office; but each one is equally essen
tial and has a definite place to fill
Verses Six, Seven and Eight
“Having then gifts different ac
cording to the grace that is given to
us, whether prophecy, let us prohesy
according to the proportion of faith;
or ministry, let us wait on our min
istering; or he that teacheth, on
teaching; or he that exhoreth, on ex
hortation; he that glveth, let him do
It with simplicity; he that ruleth,
with diligence; he that showeth
mercy, with cheerfulness.”
Here we are taught that every one
should do the things for which he is
best fitted, or perform that task for
which he has a gift or talent. As
each member of the body has a spe
cific work to which it is peculiarly
adapted; so also, each Klansman has
a task to perform.
The smallest wheel and the short
est belt in the great factory are just
as essential and necessary as the great
fly-wheel and the massive boilers.
Let no Klanman despair because he
cannot be the head or heart; but let
him rejoice that he can serve as
eyes, ears or even as feet. May we
find our place and fill it with credit
and profit to all who are concerned.
Do what you can do and do it well.
Verse Nine
“Let love be without dissimula
tion. Abhor thmt which Is evil;
cleave to that which Is good.”
Our love must be unadulterated,
unmixed with evil; wholly devoted
'to that which is good. God will
not accept a divided love. “You can
not servo God and Mamon, You
must love one and hate the other.
Every Klansman must abhor, or hate
evil, cleave to and defend the good.
There is no halfway ground. We
cannot comoromise with wrong.

another with brotherly love; In hon-

FIRST PDDLIC PARADE
National Lecturer Explains Or*
gnnization at Public
\ Session
INVERNESS, FLA., April I.—ln
verness Klan made its first public
parade through the streets of this
city last night. The presence of a
Klan here was practically unknown
except to its members, and the ap
pearance of the Klansmen was a
pleasant surprise to many of the lo
cal residents.
The parade was followed by an ad
dress by a national lecturer of the
Klan, who spoke for some time, out
lining the plans and policies of the
organization, and explaining many
things concerning the Klan which
local people either did not under
stand or about which they had been
misinformed.
Inverness Klan is growing rapidly,
and the better class of men in this
section are affiliating with the new
organization.
or preferring one another.”
Brotherly love is a commendable
virtue. It is the recognition *f the
Fatherhood of God and the Brother
hood of man. Klansmen are brothers
in a common cause against a common
foe. Preferring one another in honor
teaches us to be unselfish in seeking
to honor each other. This is the
spirit of unselfish fellowship.
Terse Eleven
M Not slothful In business; fervent
In spirit; serving the Lord.”
This teaches us that we should
not be lazy, indolent or indifferent in
our business or vocational affairs;
and that we should be spiritually
alive and active in serving the Lord.
There is no room, either in the
temporal affairs of this life or the
spiritual affairs of the kingdom of
God for a slothful or lazy man. The
same is true of Klankraft. A Klans
man must be actively patriotic and
constantly Klannish.
Verse Twelve
“Rejoicing In hope; patient In tri
bulations; continuing instant In pray
er.”
Hope is the anchor of the soul that
reaches to that within the vail.
Christians should rejoice in that
hope. Klansmen should rejoice in
the hope that the sacred and sub
lime principles of Klankraft will
triumph over the wrong, and that
“right will rule the earth.” All of
us can be patient when everything
is all right and goes to suit us; but
when adversities .trials, temptations,
troubles and tribulations come we
need to be patient. We have passed
through the fires of persecution:
have been abused, misrepresented,
vilified, cursed and hated, but we
have borne it all in patience. In
patience we will win the victory.
“Continuing instant in praypr ’’
means to be always praying. Paul
said another place, “pray * ■
and again, “pray without d * ve? ”
Christ, our Criterion, said:'. ...ay
for your enemies.” Klansmen should
be always in the spirit of prayer.
Don’t forget to pray, Klansmen. and
God will give us the victory. Right
will win.
Terse Thirteen
“Distributing to the necessity of
saints; given to hospitality.”
Let us .not forget that this is es
sentially a great fraternal and bene
volent order. Charity is a great vir
tue. We should seek to build hospi
tals and homes for the needy and to
relieve the sufferings of the poor.
Christ came not to be ministered
unto, but to minister. We should
endeavor to follow his example; ev
ery Klansman’s life and home should
be aglow with real hospitality. This
is the spirit of unselfishness. Minis
tering to others is one of our im
perative duties. Our motto is: Not
for self, but for others.
Verse fourteen
“Bless them which persecute you;
bless and cone net."
This is hard to do; but the harder
the task the more important it is.
Let us refrain from denouncing our
persecutors. They arc to be pitied
rather than sensued. Let our ene
mies hurl their curses, but let us
“bless and curse not."
Verse Fifteen
“Rejoice with them that do rejoice,
and weep with them that weep."
This verse teaches us the lesson of
sympathy and fellowship. We should
share the joys and the sorrows of our
brethren. The joy of others should
increase our joy. and their grief
should make our hearts sad. Enter
into their lives, for we are all a part
of the great whole.
Verse Sixteen
“Be of the same mind one toward
another. Mind high things, but
condescend to men of low estate. Be
not wise In yonr own eoncits.”
To be. of the same mind means
that there should be no fiction,
•nalace, envy, division, strife or dis
tention. Let harmony prevail. Fur
thermore, we should not be high
minded, puffed-up, arrogant or self
important. That “better-than-thou”
spirit is excluded by “condescending
u» men of low estate." Klansmen
are not distinguished by the fiber of
their garments, their social standing,
•heir political influence, nor their
bank account. They are on a plane
%f equality. "Be not wise in your
own conceit," is a timely admonition
to all Klansmen and should be wisely
heeded. Be like the owl who lived
in an oak.
Verse Seventeen
“Rerompejise to no man evil lor
evil. Provide things honest In the
sight of all men."
It is hard to keep from paying our
tMiemies back and adding a littlo for
interest. We are prone to “get even"
with the other fellow. The law of
Mioses said, “An eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth." But our Criter
ion of Character taught ua to “re
turn good for evil."
He honorable before all men. A

American Style is to Be Followed In
Constructing Largest Office Building
The world’s largest office building, 37 stories high, here illustrated from
the architect’s drawing, is to be erected in New York on the large block
bounded by Thirty-second and Thirty-third streeets and Fourth and Lexing
ton avenues, at present occupied by ancient and unsightly car barns. The
ground will be broken within a few weeks. The building, which is to contain
of New York and the General Motors building in Detroit —is to be distinctly
American in architectural treatment.
WISCONSIN COLLEGE PROFESSOR USES
WORNOUT ARGUMENTS AGAINST KLAN
(Special to Fiery Cross)
APPLETON, WIS., March 22.-The
same, old, threadbare argument is
being used here by the alien propa
gandists against the movement of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
The aliens have heard that the order
is getting attention of some of the
best citizens in this part-of the state,
and, as usual, are appealing to weak
kneed Protestants to help combat he
movement.
A sample of this propaganda ap
peared recently in an Appleton news
paper as a contribution from the
pen of R. C. Millenix. a professor in
Lawrence college here. It is so simi
lar to the propaganda broadcast in
so many communities that some per
sons here are of the opinion the pro
fessor was saved taxing his own
brain and muscle in the preparation
of the article. It is suspected that
the aliens simply handed him a type
written article sent out by its press
bureau and the professor was so
elated by the prospect of breaking
into print that he signed his name
and the aliens did the rest by send
ing it to the editor.
Tat Foothold Stuff
The first paragraph over the sign
ture of Professor Millenix is as fol
lows:
“The people of Appleton can not
afford complacently to permit the
Ku Klux Klan to get a foothold in
our midst.”
Then the communication goes on to
recite that the hooded organization is
dangerous. But he only takes the
word of discredited news items, not
one of which has been proved, to
show that the organization is dan
gerous. But he only cites the fact
that the community has a lot of
good Jews, a lot of good Roman
Catholics, some Chinese, but no ne
groes as residents.
Klansmen values honor more than
life. He should be the very soul of
honor. Let no Klansman stoop to do
a dishonorable deed. Honor is the
virtue of a Klansman.
Verse Eighteen
“If It he possible, as much as Iletli
In you, live peaceably with All men."
Paul recognized the fact that some
men will not be peaceable. The un
ruly, mob spirit cannot be controll
ed. Some men have no regard for
law, or respect for the rights of
others. The apostle had been as
saulted by mobs, hut it was not his
fault. If the peace is distruhed. the
law violated, or the rights of others
disregarded, let it is not be “our”
fault. No matter what others may
do, let all Klansmen do the right
thing.
Verse Nineteen
FDearly beloved, avenge not yonr
selves, but rather give place to
wrath; lor It Is written, vengeance Is
mine; I will repay, salth the Lord.”
It is not ours to wreak vengeance
on our fellowman. We should not
undertake to get revenge when
another has wronged us. Anger and
wrath have no place in a Klansman’s
life. Vengeance, revenpe belongs to
God. He will satisfy justice. We
seek to bring the wrong-doer to the
bars of justice and satisfy the law;
but not in the spirit of revenge. This
is done for the protection of socity.
the safety of property and the se
curity of personal righta.

Continued on page 7
The letter to the editor then calls
attention to the fact that Appleton
is an unusual community, sate and
sane, well-behaved and that its law
officers are of the Simon-pure stripe
doing their duty first, last and all
the time. The communication then
makes a plea for the right of Roman
Catholics to teach in the public
schools. This would seem rather un
usual, coming from a Protestant pro
fessor of a Protestant college, but
the aliens have a way of picking out
the weak-kneed ones and getting
them to sign their names to almost
any kind of communication, so long
as it bristles with misrepresentation
of the Klan.
Against IMJilc. Too
The professor also takes a stand
against the Bible being presented to
public schools- -at least by Klans
men. Others have signed their names
to communications of the same sort
The professor is liberal with his
predictions. He folds the veil back
as it were, and peers into the future.
What do you suppose he sees: “An
orgy of bitterness and strife such as
we have not known.”
On the tail end of the communica
tion he admits that the Knights ot
the Ku Klux Klan “have drawn into
the organixation in many parts of the
country many good and well-mean
ing people."
Inadvertently he does hit the truth.
This professor probably would be the
most surprised person in Appleton if
he knew now many of these good and
well-meaning persons were now
members in good standing and good
active the Klan organi
sation right m his own neighbor
hood. The Klan is growing here, and
growing rapidly.
Neither Failure
Nor Despair
(Omaha World-Herald)
Not long ago there was made the
final announcement of a great trag
edy of Christian effort, the failure
of the Interchurch World Movement
In a good many ways this was planned
as the most ambitious undertaking
ever conceived by religious zealots.
It aimed at no less a goal than the
complete evangelization of the world
within the life time of the men be
hind the movement. It’s slogan was
“The world for Christ in this genera
tion."
The movement was planned along
strictly up-to-date lines. The mod
ern marvels of business efficiency,
organization and publicity were the
means through which it was to ac
complish its results. There was
abundance of faith behind it.
First there was to have been col
lected a colossal campaign fund with
which the work of evangelization
might be carried on. Within a short
time the movement found bankrupt
cy and failure staring it in the face
Discouraged, the men engaged in the
movement wound up its affairs and
set out to liquidate its debts. That
has just been accomplished and the
promoters have earned retirement
with clean hands and good con
sciences.
Probably there is no single ade
quate explanation of that failure
Whatever the explanation* they are
interesting now only as history. The
Important fact that remains is thnt
the failure is in no sense a failure of
the Christian church. That institu
tion recognises no defeat, is con
scious of no repulse. Always on the
offensive, it know* only triumph.
Ministers of the church may de
plore its lack of power here and
there. They see signs of u need for
its influence in this or that social sit-
Inspiring Klan Klorero
Held at Wichita, Kansas
WICHITA. KAN.. March 31.—That
Kansas Klansmen are solidly united
and are “klucking" one hundred per
cent day and night, was proved be
yond doubt when 1,000 Exalted Cy
clops. Kligrapos and delegates from
all parts of Kansas met here last
Saturday and Sunday in annual state
convention. Visitors from other
states were present. Several of the
most prominent Klansmen spoke at
the Klorero, which was presided over
by George C. McCarron, Imperial
representative.
Enemies of American democracy
would have been panic stricken and
the “doubting Thomases" would have
experienced a revelation could they
have sat in this state meeting, listen
ing to the lofty ideals of the Klan
and beheld the formation of plans for
carrying out its great work in Kan
sas.
The high standard of work that is
being carried on by the order was
proved conclusively by an address by
H. K. Ramsey, Imperial Kligrapp of
Atlanta; T. J. McKinnon, of the Im
perial staff, together with the Im
perial Klokard, were also present and
addressed the convention.
The Imperial Klokard delivered
a splendid address in which he told
of nis observations in Atlanta and
gave the Klansmen some information
on local conditions which they could
carry back home, and which will re
sult in the accomplishment of a
tremendous amount of good.
Resolutions were adopted pledging
the united support of Kansas Klans
men to Dr. H. W. Evans and the
present administration, as well as
the state headquarters A resolution
was also adopted condemning the
case with which paroles were ob
tained by men and women convicted
of crime, as tending to breed disre
spect for the laws, and urging that
no paroles be granted except for ill
ness of the prisoner or immediate
relatives.
Twenty Exalted Cyclops and Kli
grapps were recipients of the second
degree, K-Duo, which was conferred
by N. C. Jewett, Grand Dragon of
Oklahoma, who flew from Oklahoma
City to Wichita by airplane. Snow
was encountered during the journey
and while he was in the air delegates
at the convention arose and spent
one minute in silent prayer for his
safe journey through the storm.

uation. They seek by pulpit sensa
tionalism, by one device or another
to awaken what they deem to be a
flagging interest in religion. But the
great institution to which they min
ister is conscious of no such need.
A religious census just completed
by the Christian Herald gives an es
timate of more than 45 million
church communicants in the United
states for 1923. This is an estimat
ed growth over the previous year of
more than six hundred thousand,
which shows Christian church mem
bership more than keeping pace with
the growth of population. Besides
these millions, there are other mil
lions, who, in every religious test ex
cept perhaps that of public confes
sion by church affiliation, are God
fearing Christians.
There may be Norrises among the
ministry of the Christian church who
despair of its power, but the church
itself does not know their feeling
It continues to march on solemnly,
steadily, militantly, knowing neithei
failure nor despair.
