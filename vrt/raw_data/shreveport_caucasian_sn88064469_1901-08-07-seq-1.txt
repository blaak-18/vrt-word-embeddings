New York, Aug. 7 -Dr. Doty, health
officer of the port has at last oommenc
ed the war of destruction of the nmos.
quitoes of (ircater New York and vi
cinity. lo and bis assistauts havo
taken thelir paraphiernalia, which con
sists largely of kerosene oil, to the pond
near Concord. Staten Island, and forced
barrels of the oil under the surface of
the water It was expected that while
the fluid is making its way to the sur
face it will destroy all the embryonio
mosquito life therein. Dr. Doty said he
could not be positive about the success
of the experiment for a month, but he
thought it would work well.
Dr. Eugene Monaghan, sanitary super.
intendent of the Bronx, says he believes
the malaria at Fordhain was caused by
mosquitoes. The experiments by Dr.
Doty are being watched and if they are
successful the scattering of oil on the
swamps and low places in Fordham will
be begun. Dr. Monaghan said that the
malaria.bearing mosquitos did a great
deal of damage, but he did not believe
that they caused so much sickness in
this climate as they do in the tropics.

Recent Naval Maneovers.
New Yozk, Aug. 7.--Commenting
upon the naval maneuvers in which the
attaoking squadron supposed to repreo
sent "the enemy" has just been declared
the victor, The Tribune's London oorre
spondent says:
There has been more realism in these
maneuvers than the admiralty authori.
ties had expected. Not only have two
torpedo boat destroyers been lost but
several others have been crippled.
The wreck of the Viper is the most
serious accident of the maneuvers. This
vessel was an experiment and her per
formanoes were being witnessed by the
admiralty experts.
The destroyer Violet is said to be in a
bad way. Nearly all the water tube
boilers have been disabled through split
tubes and it was only by great presence
of mind and prompt action that the
stokers were saved from being scalded
to death.

sentence of dismissal from the army of
Major F. Eltonhead to placing that offi

profane and abusive language to Lieut.

Philadelphia, Aug. 7.-A terrific ex
plosion in a block of six buildings on
Locust street, above Tenth street, at
9 o'clock Monday night completely de
stroyed five of the structures, three 3
stories and two 2,.-stories, and caused
the death of ten or more persons.
Over two score of others were more or
less seriously injured. Some of those
taken to the hospital will die. It is ese
timated that at least 35 persons were in
the five buildings when the explosion
occurred and the exact number of dead
not yet known.
What exploded and how it happened
is not yet known, but it is believed to
have been a barrel of gasoline in one of
the three groceries. Almost every build
ing within a radius of two blocks of the
explosion had windows shattered and
were otherwise damaged. Every build
ing on the opposite side of Locust street
was more or less wrecked, but none of
them fell.
A terrific cry went up from the ruins
the moment the explosion occ-rred.
Women, children and men occupants of
the wrecked houses, could be seen
crawling from the debris, while the
agonizing cries of others were heard in
the wreckage From all the surrouad

conscious. To add to the horror, fire
broke out in the debris the moment it
settled to the ground and in less than
five minutes the great pile was burning
fiercely from end to end A general
alarm was turned in for the fire ap
paratus and ambulances and in the
meantime the work of rescue was vol

borhood who were not injured.
Here and there a person was dragged
from the ruins before the fire could
reach the victim, several lives being
raved by this prompt work. When the
fremen reached the scene the flames
had made great headway and were ig
niting the buildings across the street.
The fire, however, was soon under con
trol. The work of digging away the
ruins was then began in earnest and
soon several were rescued.
While the work of rescue was going
on in the exploded block, hospital at
tendants and others made a search of
of all the damaged houses on the other
side of the street and almost a score of
persons were taken to various hospitals
from these places.
The Jefferson and Pennsylvania hos

scene of the explosion, were soon crowd.

Only three dead bodies had been res

Berlin. Aug. 7.--A special edition of
The Reichaunzieger contains an impe

The order also directs all public amuse

white lillies in his mother's hands.

Papers comment on the political side
of the dowager empress' character with

oomprehensive that a woman of her abil.

Democrats a week ago, and like the
Democrats, paid monre attention to the
adoption of a platform than to the
selection of candidates for the minor
offices of comptroller and clerk of the
court of appeals. There were but two
aspirants. The platform is the work
of United States Senator McComas and
P. L. Goldsborough, chairman of the
state central committee, who is regard
ed as a promising candidate for the seat
of Senator Wellington in the event of
Republican success. Unlike the Demo
oratic declaration of principals adopted
last week much stress is laid upon
national issues. The administration of
President McKinley is heartily endorsed,
the policy of the Republican party upon
the tariff, currency and other vital
questions of national moment strongly
commended, while that of the Demo.

The following is the ticket nominated:

GOLD BULLION GONE.
Thiewee Steal 6230,000 Worth from the
Selby Smelter Works.
San Francisoo, Aug. 7.-News has
been received here from the Selby Smelt
ing works at Vallejo, that $250,000
worth of gold bullion had been stolen
from the Works during Monday night.
The thieves tunneled under the works
and gained access to the strong room
where the bullion was stored. The
works are close to San Francisco bay
and the tunnel extended from the
water's edge under the building. It is
supposed the thieves took the bullion
away by boat.
The Selby smelter is the biggest on
the Pacific coast and ores are sent there
from all parts of the western country to
be reduced.
FILING THEIR CLAIMS.
LOeky One ln the Lend Lottery Making
Their Selections.
El Reno, O. T., Aug. 7.-The last act
in the opening of the Indian land in the
Kiowa-Comanche reservations began
today, when the winners in the lot
tery were permitted to file on their
claims. The filing began in El Reno
for the El Reno district and at Fort Sill
for the Lawton district. At each place
125 of the lucky ones will be permitted
to file in order of their names drawn
from the wheels Filing at the rate of
250 will continue daily until the entire
13,0'0 claims are disposed of.
It is estimated that at least 2000 or
5000 claims drawn at the lottery will
never be filed on. There will be a live
scramble for them by the thousands of
people who did not win in the lottery.

New York, Aug. 7.-The executive 1
committee of the Canal association of a
Greater New York, has just reached an
important conclusion in regard to its
future work, says the Journal of Coln
merce. The committee has been waver
ing on the question whether the promise
of a deep waterway from the lakes to
the seaboard entirely under national
control did not offer better prospects of 1
prompt attainment than a 1000-ton barge
canal. The cause of the wavering was I
the publication of the detailed report
of the deep waterways commission
This report has now been thoroughly
digested by the oommittee and it has
been formerly decided that the interestr~
of New York will be better served by a
1000-ton barge canal than by the larger
project.

be used where there is a preponderance

hair from falling out. It also makes It
darker; so the caution to rub it on the
scalp and avoid getting it on the hair
Is especially important to fair haired
women.
There are many methods of perfum
ing the hair, which is much a fad now
adays. The scent can be put in the
rinse water or on the hair just before
it is dry or a perfumed cap can be
worn at night. It is best, however, not
to confine the ha!r at night. Braid it
losely or have it flowing If it does not
snarl easily.
I)o not use hot irons on the hair if
you wish to keep it silky and long.
Tight crimping pins are also injurious.
If it must be curled, do it up loosely in
kids or soft paper. A soft curl is much
prettier than crimps.
D)o not tie the hair up tight on the
head. It rot only loosens the roots and
is a prolific source of baldness, but it
makes impossible that soft, loose, pret
ty effect which is essential in modern,
fashionable hairdressing.
Well kept hair in a healthy condition
should be soft and pliable, with a rich
silky luster that is the most eiquisite
frame for any face, old or young.
