OUR POST-CARD CLUB
By DADDY JIM
Letters in the name contest came
in so fast, right up to the 19th,
which is the date on which we have
to furnish “copy” for the following
week’s paper, that we were unable
to go through them all and pick the
winners. We will publish the win
ners in this contest next week.
A TEXAS BOY.
I saw in your Jeffersonian of Au
gust sth your name contest. My father
takes the Jeffersonian, and thinks it

a little boy, under 15 years of age, so
1 hope I will win one of your prizes.
—Marion Bradham, Roans Prairie,
Texas.
HOPES TO BE A FARMER.
I am sending a list of names for
your name contest, and hope to win
the prize. My daddy takes the Jef
fersonian, and I read it from start to
finish and enjoy it very much. I will
tell you what I hope to be when I am
a man, and that is a farmer, and own
fine horses. lam 14 years old this
month. Wish you good luck. —James
McCullough, Pinetta, Fla.
SOMETHING TO DO.
I see so many nice letters from
boys and girls from different States,
I will let you hear from a little Geor
gia girl. I live seven miles from
Reynolds, Ga., and four miles from
Miona Springs. I am attending a
singing school at Garden Valley, and
like it. Papa takes the Jeffersonian.
I anxiously look forward to its com
ing. In this week’s issue Daddy Jim
has set us to thinking. I am glad
he has given us something to do. I
am 14 years old, and am in the eighth
grade. Enclosed you will find my list
of boys’ and girls’ names.—Annie
Mae McDaniel, R. F. D. 3, Reynolds,
Ga.
ONE MORE FROM LOUISIANA.
) in >i, r
I am a girl, 14 years old. My
father is a subscriber to your paper,
and always enjoys reading it. This is
my first attempt to write to you, or
work for any of your contests, but
hope I may be successful. I have
made some names out of the letters
given, and did not use one letter
twice in tne same word. Wishing you
much success.—Maud Hood, Bastrop,
La.
SEVEN YEARS OLD.
lam a little girl, 7 years old. Our
school was out the 21st of May. My
teacher’s name is Miss Marie Phillips.
She gave us a picnic. We had a big
dinner at the picnic. I have a little
sister, and her name is Beulah. My
papa takes the Jeffersonian, and I like
to read the letters in it. I live in the
country, and my papa is a rice farmer.
If this letter doesn’t get lost, I will
write again some time. I like to go to
school. —Corinne Smith, Nederland,
Texas.
I#
FROM SOUTH GEORGIA.
I have a beautiful home, surround
ed by fine oaks, pines, sweetgums
and poplars. My sisters have a fine
yard of roses of all kinds. The pub-
Obe Jeffersonian
lie road runs just fifteen steps from
the gate. I have a large swing just
across the road from the house. I
enjoy swinging. We have a large
grape arbor; the grapes are getting
ripe, and we have a jolly time eating
them. We have a little dog; his
name is Cracker; he likes to hunt
rabbits while we boys pick cotton.
I think some boys are useful, or at
least my sisters must think so. They
keep me at the house to help them
sometimes, and it’s Albert this and
Albert that; “Albert, bring in some
wood”; “Albert, take out the ashes”;
‘Albert, sweep the floor”. I think
there’s no end to the work, but I’d
rather stay at the house and help the
girls than to work in the hot sun.—
ALBERT HEALD, 9 years old, Thom
asville, Ga.
COTTON PICKING.
Well, cotton picking time is here
again. It’s “Get your sack, ’Gene”,
but we haven’t much cotton to pick,
and I’m glad we haven’t, for I don’t
like the work. We boys have good
times going in bathing in the river.
I can swim very well, and I do enjoy
it. My father and brother take the
Jeffersonian, and I like to read it.
Also my uncle takes it; in fact, we
all like to read it, from the oldest to
the youngest. I am glad Mr. Wat
son let us have space in his paper to
write. I have never seen him, but
have seen his picture, and it looks
good to me. EUGENE HEALD,
Thomasville, Ga.
A LOUISIANA COUSIN.
Dear Daddy Jim and Cousins:
How are you all this warm evening?
lam all O. K. lam a farmer’s little
daughter, 11 years old; dark hair,
fair complexion, blue eyes, 4 feet 11
inches tall, and weigh 72 pounds. I
live eight miles from the small town
of Bernice, La., close to a creek. • I
went to school a little while this
summer, but the school broke up.
My teacher’s name was Mr. Thorne.
I am in the fifth grade. I would
like to be a school teacher. As for
boys, I think some of them are nice,
and others are not; the bad ones
make fun of girls because they play
with dolls and have playhouses.
Some girls are useful and nice, and
some are selfish and fussy. For my
pets, I have eight dolls, one cat, one
calf, and one turkey, and have a
playhouse. Your cousin and friend,
LETTIE MAY ROCKET, Bernice, La.
ANOTHER FROM LOUISIANA.
I am a little country girl, 13 years
old, 5 feet, 1 inch tall. I am send
ing you some names. I hope I will
get the ring. I like to read. We
raise sheep, hogs and horses. I do
not like to live on a farm. It is hot
down here. I will send my picture.
I live near “Clear Lake”, and we go
there fishing sometimes. I would
like to get a card from any of you
Jeffs. I like post-cards. I used to
live in Alabama, where there is good
water. I went out there three years
ago, and had a nice time. I am, a
new member, LELA M. SLONE, R.
F. D. 1, Mansfield, La.

PUZZLE POST CARDS
If you will sen d me 10
cents for a 3 months’
►K■■ ■■ subscription to my large
paper, The Farmers
Voice, I will make you
a present of this novel
set of 10 puzzle post cards. You
dimply write a message on the face
of the card, then, tear it along the
guide lines and send it to your
friends who will nearly puzzle their
heads off trying to put the cards to
gether, for only by doing this can
they read your message. The views
on the cards are beautiful in the ex
treme, but are rendered still more
attractive to the person who tries to
put the card together because of
your message written thereon. I
have a surprise for everyone that
will send me a 3 months’ subscrip
tion. Don’t delay—write today.
