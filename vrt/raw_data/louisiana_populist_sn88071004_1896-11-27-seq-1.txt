TELLS MARTINSBURO FARMERS
THAT "MONEY IS A CREA
TURE OP LAW."
A Truthful Declaration Boldly sad Us*
egulveealy Iade, the Bgailasace of
Which Is Colprehended by Thought
tal Reformers.
Mr. Bryan voiced good common sense
and the straightest of populist doc
trine on the money question when he
talked as follows to the farmers of
Martilsburg, W. Va., on the 10th of last
month:
"My friends, our opponents msume
that money is a thing creatd by com
merce and that law has nothing to do
with it. I want to my to you that
money is a creature of law. You can
have as much or as IRUtl money as the
law permits. It the laws are made by
those who want money to be high priced
they make mosey scaes In order that
money may be hgh p leet If you
want money sciestly plentitful to
keep pace with population and indus
try, the laws have got to be made by
those who believe in having enough
money to keep pace with population.
(Applause.)
Certainly "money Is a eresture of
law." All populsts worthy of the
name know that and have known it
for some time. Whe ter the law de

it is absolutely certan1 that it could
have no ezisteme but for the
"fiat" of law calling it into being and
establishing the qusatity, character,

which it is ogipoed. Mr. Bryan evi

The redemption theory of money is
nothing more nor less than a clumsy
attempt to call in the assistance of na
ture in limiting the supply of money.
It is "clumsy," because the gold, or
gold and silver, of which the theory
holds the redemption money must be
made, while produced in certain lim
ited quantities, may, nevertheless, be,
by the law creating money, divided In
to such infinitesimal money units as to
create an absolutely unlimited supply
of gold and silver money, to say noth
ing about the volume of paper money
which might be based upon, and re
deemable in, these depreciated money
units. The law which declares that
twenty-five and eight-tenths grains of
standard gold shall constitute a dollar,
might as easily declare for any other
number lems than that and it would be
just as effective if it declared for the
hundredth part of a grain as it is now.
Then is it lot correct to say that the
redemption theory is a "clumsy" one?
And does it not depend entirely upon
the well-known abhorrence of the peo
ple, or their lazy disinclination, for the
investigation of economic questions
for Its continuance?
But can anybody, give a good reason
why the accidents of nature, or any
other power, should be invoked to limit
the supply of money in any other way
than that in which the supply of post
age stamps is? Postage stamps are
"creatures" of the government and are
provided in amounts limited only by
the demand by the government direct
to the people for their express benett.
Money is a creature of the government
that is as essential to the welfare of
the people as postage stamps are, but
lnstead of the government providing
money direct to the people it only pro
vides it to those who are fortunate
,enough to be the possessors of a cer
tain kind of metal, or to beankers who
can put up evidences of its own in
debtedness, and the eonsequence is
that 70,000,000 people are absolutely de
pendent upon a -few metal and boad
owners for their supply of money.
This condition is not only wrong, but
it is largely responsible for the "bard
times" universally complained of. The
same money ideas obtain in this na
tion as prevail all over the world and
while a change in the plan of providing
this nation with money will not, of it
self, bring entire relief, It is eamf to as
sume, since otaer nations provided as
this one is are even in a worse oadi
tion than it is that a change Is neces
sary. The fact that W. J. Bryan has
publicly proclaimed the doctrine that
"mosey is a creatre of law" Inspires
all Intelligent, thoughtful reformers
with renewed confidence in his ability,
courage and honesty.
THOUGHTS ABOUT MONEY
my "Crams aeed aseeahs."
The wor man who takes property by
force is called a thief, but the creditor
who can by legislation make a debtor
pay a dollar twice as large as he bor
rowed is landed as a friend of sonnd

Banks are more dangerous to the lib
erties of the people than standing ar

If the Americans adopt our banking
and funding system, their libertle are

By the eternal, we will see which is

Gold is the most useless metal in the

Avarice says: "1 will oppress the

Bank paper must be suppressed, and
the circulating medium must be re

The bank is the union of the govern

far more dangerous than church and
'tate.-John C Calhoun.
The present system of finance robs
labor, gorges capital, makes the rich
richer and the poor poorer, and turns
a republic into an aristocracy of capi
tal.-Wendell Phillips in 1810.
Anything upon which the govern
ment places its stamp and declare8 it
a legal tender in payment of all debts
and taxes is money, no matter what
the material may be.-Henry Clay.
I believe the struggle now going on
in this country and in other countries
for a single gold standard will if suc
cessful produce widespread disaster in
the end throughout the world.--ames
G. Blaine.
If a government contract a debt with
a certain amount of money in circula
tion, and then contracts the money vol
umebeforethe debt is paid,it is themost
heinous crime that a government amn
commit against the people.-Abtaham
Lincoln.
Man is the only animal on earth that
will quietly suffer for food among plen

so small that he will see his tender of
spring suffer with cold where there is
plenty of material to keep him war.-
Inter Mountain Advocate.
My friends, unless our children have
more patience and courage than saved
this country from slavery, republican
institutions will go down before
moneyed corporations. Rich men die,
but corporations are immortal.. They
are never alicted with disease. In
the long run they Are bound to win
with legislatures.-Wendell Phillips.
Place the money power In the hands
o: a combination of a few inaividuals
and they, by expanding or contracting
the currency, may raise or sink pries
at pleasure, and by purchasing when at
the greatest depression, and selling
when at the greatest elevation, may
command the whole property lnd in
dustry of the community. The behk
ing system concentrates and places this
power in the hands of those who con
trol it. Never was an engine invented
better calculated to place the destinies
of the many in the hands of the few.
John C. Calhoun.
"Yes, we may all congratulate our
selves that this cruel war is nearing a
close. It has cost a vast amount of
treasure and blood. The best blood of
the fower of American youth has been
freely ofered upon our country's altar
that the nation might live. It has
been, tndeed, a trying hour for the re
public, but I see in the near future a
crisis approaching that unnerves me
and causes me to tremble for the safe
ty of my country. As a result of the
war, corporations have been enthroned
and an era of corruption in high places
will follow, and the money power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its
reign by working upon the prejudices
of the people until all wealth is agtre-
gated tn a few bands and the republic
is destroyed. I feel at this moment
more anxiety for the safety of my
country than ever before, even tn the
midst of the war. God grant that my
suspietious may prouve andles."
Abraham Linseol.
As Garfield said, the men who control
the money of a country control its

OFF OF THEIR BASE.
SOME SELF-ALLEGED CHRIS
TIANS AND THEIR DEEDS.
The Hypeorites and Black Sheep with
in the Fold are Generally agaulst
Bryan-Usury In the Church-- Legal
izing Crime.
From The Coming Nation: War is
generally carried on in the name of
God and liberty. Christian people have
taught themselves that they have a
God-given right to kill and plunder all
the little nations of helpless heathen,
in order to convert them-into slaves.
They call it fighting the devil. They
call themselves Christian warriors, just
as though a man could be a Christian
and a legal murderer.
Imagine Christ and his disciples
standing ready to cut each other's
throat, and you have a fair picture of
the Christian nations of today prepar
ing to blow each other into eternity.
The man who discovers or invents
some great life destroyer is considered
a benefactor to his country, and the
churches are the loudest in their ap
plause. Can we hope for anything
good to come out of such a Christian
spirit of plunder and conquest?
The churches oa Christ! Great God,
what misnomers! Accepting peace of
ferings from the greedy and heartless
rich, peace-offerings in the shape of
money squeezed from the toiling poor.
How they mislead and corrupt the
minds of the young, making them be
lieve that the modern church is doing
the work of Christ.
A wealthy Chicago woman lately do
nated $75,000 to Prof. Swing's church,
and the committee has decided to in
vest the cash in mortgages, the income
to be used in "broadening the work of
the church," to use the language of the
committee.
Think of it! A church that pretends
to do the work of Christ, and living on
the money squeezed from the mort
gaged slave! Did Christ teach usury?
Christians get around thip point by
contending that any "legal amount of
interest" is not usury.
In Colorado there is no legal rate of
interest The law allows you to de
mand whatever rate you can get, and to
collect it, even if the poor mortgaged
slave is turned out to starve in mid
wlater.
Why, brother toilers, there is not a
single law that we have today in this
greed-cursed country that conforms to
the teachings of Christ. "Seli that
thou hast and give to the poor," if
carried out to the letter, and in the
spirit of true Christianity, would wipe
out every single law that protects
property and makes debt a crime.
And yet the modern church con
forms only to our man-made laws, con
struing Christ's law to suit the occa
sion.
Can we hope for any assistance from
these corrupted people, while even the
cause of Christ (?) is bolstered up by
the aceursed mortgage?
These are the Christian warriors who
are fighting the devil-for revenue only;
that go out to conquer heathen na
tions in the name of God-for plunder;
who sing liberty songs, while they live
on the usury squeezed from the poor
mortgaged slaves, and offer the work
inlgman miserable charity, instead of
lustice.
The average Christian of today is as
much afraid of Justice as the devil is
s:lpposesd to be afraid of "holy water"
and never grants it to anybody willing
I:-. He seems to think it a dangerous
t obit to establish.
:ie is like the Irishman who was ar
re sted for wife murder, and who was
promised justipe by his attorney.
'Justioee' he exclaimed, "bedad Oi'm
in a position to make use of any
other branch ov the legal profesion,
but justlee is the wan thing I want
to esape, begorrah!"
I have always been in favor of
itomsu affrage, and am yet, provid
ing women are educated in something
higher than modern churchism. But
I used to thinkL that women, being the
chief support of the churches, would
purify politics.
Alas, how sadly I have been mis
taken. In Colorado the women have
been voting for two years, and the
state is more corrupt than ever. The
saloon still flourishes and is legalized
by high license; gambling goes on as
usual. Only a few months ago in my
own town a man who was openly ac
cused of running a gambling hell was
elected by a large tujerity to All an
important omce.
The church people have been running
little gambling schemes so long for the
glory of God that they have grown to
Ilhe it, and the professional gashbler
simply makhes a hbackground to their
own plicture of Christianity.
When the women of Colorado helped
to "redeem the state," as the hyLocrlti
cal politicieans taught the Christians to
yawp, I spected to ee reform on every
hand. Rev. Myron Reed and P. F.
SPasmore were called all sorts of vile
names because they did net Jeln the
"redeemers;" but, just as these two
heroes predicted, crime has bein en

cattle, and ar, fined to fatten the purs'
of public officers, while a small pet
cent goes to lighting and paving tho"
streets where the pious redeemers
tread.
And the mortgage laws are running
in the same stage of hellish glory.
Usury on every hand. But the church
has grown used to it-grovwn and fat
tened on this child of hades; and never
a word is heard against it from the
pulpits.
They spend their time searching the
Bible for the tracks of the devil, whom
they claim to be fighting, while right
in their own door-yard the devil'
tracks are yet so plain and warm 'hat
a blind Christian could easily follow
them, if he felt like doing so.
Ah, these Christian warriors seldom
fight any national wrongs. Almost
anything is right in their eyes, so long
as it pays a revenue. They can see
no harm in cornering wheat, or pork,
or oil, or land, or money, even though
thousands of the miserable poor suffer
and die of want, and all around the
church door reigns a hell of hopeless
hunger. These Christian warriors can
see no harm in it, so long as the chtrb
gets a rake-off.
These Christian warriors can see no
sin or crime among those whom God(.D
has blessed with wealth. Among those
whose hearts are as hard as the gran
ite walls of an orthodox hell, and who
live to accumulate dollars squeese0
from the hands of the toiling poor.
They do all their searching for sin
among those whom the rich have rob
bed. Those whom God has blessed
with poverty and want (God does it
all). The crimes and sins of the miser
ablepoor are searched out and laid bare
before the world. The Christian news
papers are full of their sins every day
and the police go down among them
to club them about for the glory of
God and the eternal salvation of their
souls.
At times some good souls gp down
among them to distribute tracts, in
which the story of God's love is
told them, for the purpose of mak
ing them feel still more miserable
and to look up to the rich as
the people who have a divine right
to build slums where the robbed and
outraged poor can be hidden from the
sight of God's elect, and hope can
never, never come. Ah, the deal
Christian nations! Standing ready to
rush their miserable poor into a bloody
conflict in order that the victorious
rich may glut themselves with plunder.
England has a Christian army whose
business is to butcher the heathen and
take possession of their land, and even
butcher some other Christian army it
they interfere.
ussia has a Christian army to rule
over the government hell at home, and
to gobble a little plunder from the
h..athens when a chance offers.
The whole of Europe is but a living
hell for the toiling poor, walled In by
the so-called Christian armies, who
force the poor to throw up their handy
while the rotten royalty rob them of all
but a bare existence.
And is it any better in our own coun
try' Oh, God, these pinched and fur
rowed faces of the wandering poor who
knock at my door and ask for a crust
of bread! What is the church and the
Christian warriors doing for them?
Nothing! And the echo of this cry
goes up to God and rattles against the
frame of high heaven, and the day of
wrath draws nearer at every rising of
the sun.
Ah, you Christian warriors, you are
but camp-followers, and plunderers of
the miserable poor; you never fight on
the side of the weak and lowly, but are
led by the political butchers who live
but to plunder and fatten on the bleds
of the toiling poor.
Pasrty ovesrmes.
Goveranent by party is not ag ideal

of Great Brhtain and of our own oouna

A party government at its beot is more
or less one-sided and exclustive. The
irst sad foremost object of a petll
party is, of course, the defeat of its
antagolnist political organsation, and
its exekston from participation in the
administration of public affairs. A too
longand unlnaterrupted predominnace et
a single party in a community creates
disaffectilon and disloyalty in the
ranks of its opionents, who oernme at
