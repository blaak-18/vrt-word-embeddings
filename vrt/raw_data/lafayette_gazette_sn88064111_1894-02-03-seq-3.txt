t Death of Plerrs Bernard.
Pierre Bernard died at his home
B -near Carencro Tuesday. He was I
n about 6o y&rs of age. He was born I
l in this parish where he spent all his
ill life, excepting the three years of the s
war. In his death the parish loses v
'e a good citizen who was ever ready t
d to do his duty in times of war and t
t- peace. At the breaking out of the d
:o war between the "States he enlisted t
U In Company I, 8th Louisiana i'
Regiment, under Capt. Polk Bailey, I
it and served with unswering devotion v
a during the whole of the conflict. h
t. At the close of the war he returned s
a to Carencro, his native home and o
o resumed his former occupation,-that Ii
:s of planter. A few years later when w
the white people united for the ti
overthrow of the negro government, n
then in power, Mr. Bernard once n
more answered to his country's call ti
and took a prominent part in the a
movement that resulted in the es- t
tablishment of the first Democratic ti
government after the war. Ever c
since that memovable fight for the j(
supremacy of the Democratic party, ti
he has never failed to do all in his w
power toward the perpetuation of W
the principles of that party of which is
he was an humble and faithful mem- c0
ber. We may well mourn the loss ti
of an honest man, a dutiful citizen cl
and brave soldier. tl
The large number of people who is
attended his funeral at Carencro
Wednesday attest the high esteem
in which he was held by his heigh
I bors, those who knew him best.

IN MEMORIAM.
e Soon after my atrival in Lafayette
s I became acquainted with Mrs. Jane
a Mills. Met with her at the little
s Methodist church there, of which
e she was a worthy member, and
a where she had worshipped, occupy
y ing the same pew for more than
d thirty years. The last sermon the
* deceased heard was preached by
d the writer; subject: "The-Christian's
a journey to the heavenly Canaan."
Little did I think that her journey
a would so soon be over, and that
her old and feeble frame would so
I soon be at rest. The journey is
I over however, and that desired haven
t is reached, by this faithful soldier,
t where the warfare against sin and
e the powers of darkness are feared
no more. Take thy rest, dear
mother in Israel. Rest forever in
1 thy Savior's loving embrace. Rest
and wait until others come to join
thee. Thy aged sister will soon be
there. Christian friends are com
coming. Thy ex-pastor is sure to
join thee. One by one we cross
the last river. This pure and pious
woman is not saved because she
was a Methodist. Not at all. She
is saved because she was a true and
consecrated Christian. Washed in
the blood. Born of the Spirit. A
child of God. It is not the church
that saves but character. May my
last end be like hers!

Communicated.]
The fame -of Texas has spread
from ocean to ocean, and even into e
the interior of Europe. As a result,
thousands of emigrants pour into
in that great State year after year. s
Why should this be when there are
other States more desirable? Louis
iana in a great many respects is supe
rior. Our lands are as good and
our seasons much more certain.
There are two very potent reasons
Texas advertises largely and offers
unrivaled public schools. Indeed,
this last is a very strong inducement t
to those seeking homes. A
In these last years of the zgth
century, education of the masses
has become such a prominent neces
sity and is such an universal one
that no State which is lacking in fa
cilities for the acquirement of an
education, can hope to compete ,
successfully with her sister states.
Acamdemies and colleges are not -
what are needed; but good public
schools. The trend of education ds
is now strong and exclusively to
ward public schools, and it is only
a question of time when the publie -
system will entirely supplant all pri
vate schools. Texas long ago rec
ognized this, and at once established L
one of the grandest school system hi
of any State in the union; as a re
sult, she is one of the foremost States a
to-day.
. It is true that Texas has a larger
fund which enables her to maintain '
her schools,and in this respect has the
advantage of Louisiana, yet I believe h,
that by proper exertion we can sil
likewise establish fine public schools o
throughout the State. It will, of
course, have to be done by taxation,
but the amount of benefit in the way
of better schools, increased immi
gration, and consequent enhanced be
value of land and property, will
more than balance the hardslhip p
S*~* -
s- SUGAR.
S The consumption of sugar per
o capita is regarded as one of the mur
.r est tests of the prosperity of a cona
try . While sugar is, in one light, a
,, necessity, in another it is a luxury,
d poorer classes feel that they can do
without it, except in periods of
e great prosperity. It has been no
ticed, therefore, that as the .world
grows richer its "consumption in
creases, and that the amount used
to each person in European coun
tries is an excellent test of the so
cial od financial conditions of these
several lands. Nor has the produc
tion anything to do with it, fot in
e those countries like Austria, Russia
e and Germany, whete immense quan
ties of sugar are raised, the con
sumption is very light. The fol
lowing table will give some idea of
the rapid increase in the con
sumption per capita which has oc
curred in the last three years:

It will be seen that England still
leads in the per capita consumption,
but that the United States is rapidly
catching up and will soon equal it
if not pass it. The use of sugar in
creases rapidly, the gain in the
countries given above being 4. ro
pounds, or x7 per cent in three
years.
Although the amount of sugar
consumed to each person in the
United States is less than in En
gland, we use a great deal more in
the aggregate, because our popula
tion is so much larger. The im
mense consumption and the fact
that it is certainly increasing should
encourage us to make some effort to
raise all or at least a portion of the
sugar at home, instead of depend
altogether on other lands for it.
