:Delegate Stevenson called up his
resolntion introduced Tuesday, as
follows:
Whereas. there is to-day a feeling
pf apprehension and alarm on the
part of the colored citizens of this
State witlh regard to the intended ac
tion of this Convention, it is deemed
proper in advance of any official ae
tion of this body to disabuse their
minds of any such apprehension;
therefore, be it
Reveald, That there is no inten.
tion whatsoever entertained by this
body of impairing or restricting the
political, cvil or religious rights of
any ise oaf due",sa t this S.t,
bet on the contrarj the lntention 1t
to defendInd perpetuate every and
all rights guaranteed them by this
State and by the ieonsttution of the
United States.
:Delegate Landeoppoes the consid,
eration of' the resolution at this time.
Such a resolution weaould preclude the
adoptionof a uffrage qualification in
futatreby the Convention. He there
fore offered the following as a substi
tute:
lesolatl, That there is 'ie iaten.
tion whatever entertainbed by this
bldy, of impairing or restricting the
pUllcal, civil or religious rights of
any class of citizens of the State on
account of race, color or previous
eodlition of servitude, but on the
eontrary the intention is to defend
and maintain the rights of the colored
citizens as guaranteed by the consti
t'tion of the United States and of the
State under the new constitution
about to be formed.
Delegate Cunningham moved that
the resolution and substitute be re
ferred to the Committee on the Bill
Bights..
Dolegate Cunningham favored his
resolution to refer to the Committee
on the Bill of Bights. He argued
that there was nothing in the origin.
al resolution. If the colored people
were not satisfied with the pledges
already made to them they, would
not be quieted by a resolution of this
character. He favored unqualified
suffrage, but was not prepared to say
that his views upon this subject
could not be changed by argument.
He insisted, however, that the reso
lation was not a proper one for oon
sideration at this time, and did not
believe'that it would have the slight.
est efects should it beadopted.

Convention of Louisiana, neither lh
1812. There was no authority for an
oath and no on. had autborty ,to ad
minister it. Astor himself, he would
take no oath unless competent au
thority was shown for it.
*Delegate Todd did not concur en
tirely with the two gentlemen who
had preceded him. This was the
first Convention held by the tree peo
ple of Louisiana, and it was decided
not to take the oath proposed it
would be heralded throughout the
North as the act of nnreconsarueted
rebels. He did not think the ethkat
all necessary, bat on the grona' of
policy he should favor the resolution.
Delegate Breaux opposed the reso
lution. There was too much oath
taking in the country now; besides,
the precedents were agalanst.thts par
ticular oath. For one he could do
'his duty without it. There was no
authority to administer It and hd4id.4
Uot believe it should be' imposed
Col. Breaunx ontinued his remarks in
opposition to the resolution at some
length.
Delegate Parlange favored the res
olution. He did not believe the oath
was necessary. Former conventions
of the State had refused to take any
oath; but, at the present time, when
a refusal to take the oath proposed
would be misunderstood and misrep
resented, it would .be extremely bad
policy to vote down the resolution.
Delegate Lagan did not come to
this Convention to represent the peo
ple of Massachusetts, Tennessee or
bouth Carolina. He was here to rep
resent the people of the second
ward. He was already under a
moral obligation to do his duty and
would take no further oath.
Delegate Lott favored the resolau
tion on altogether diffleront grounds
than those advocated. The members
of the Connition would be required
to act on business propositions, and
he thought it. necessary that they
should do so under oaths He desired
to oilbr the following amendment,
however, to the substitute : Add the
following words, "To the best inter
ests of the people of the State,"
Delegate Poche opposed the reso
lotion. He quoted nomerous prece.
dents to sustain his position, and es
tablished that a majority of the State
Conventions hold In the country had
refused to take any oath. -
Delegate Lyons thought ,the taking
of an oath was altogether unnecessary.
He offered his substitute because the
original proposition was highly ob
jectionable, and he thought his sub
stitute in every way preferable. He
was opposed to the whole matter, and
should vote against his own propos
tlon when it was rached.
Delegate Robertson movid to lay
thwbe saeol t matter on thTe table.
Thi Convention am proceeded to
eoasider the reportif the Ceamite
on Reles. The report, amended
and adopted and _00 cl were or
