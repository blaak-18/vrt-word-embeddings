OF INTEREST TO FARMERS
GROWING EUCALYPTUS TREES.
Os the eucalyptus there are some
140 varieties widely distributed as
to habitat; but in the southern alti
tudes of this country the eucalyptus
globulus is gaining in favor as it
seems best adapted.
' The tree does best in warm cli
mates and has been and is being
planted to great advantage in Cali
fornia and in the southern portions
of Texas.
The process of raising the euca
lyptus is one of extreme simplicity.
The seeds, well ripened, should be
sown in seed pans or wooden boxes.
They germinate quickly and grow
readily. When about four inches high
the seedlings should be transplanted
to the nursery. The operation should
be made in cool season. It is best
under a cloudy sky, and seedlings
should not be allowed to get dried
up in any way during the process of
removal. They should have daily
watering for some time after trans
planting.
The eucalyptus is a fast growing
tree and attains an extraordinary
height.
A eucalyptus tree at Port Arthur,
Texas, grew eleven feet in six
months.—Southern Orchards and
homes.
TO TEST AGE OF FOWLS.
One of the commonest ways of
testing the age of poultry is to take
the end of the breast bone farthest
from the head between the thumb
and finger and attempt to bend it to
one side. In a very young bird, say
a broiler chicken, or a green goose,
it will be easily bent, like the cartil
age in the human ear; in a bird a
year or so old it will be brittle, and
in an old bird tough and hard to
bend or break. Unfortunately, tricky
dealers sometimes break the end of
the breastbone before exhibiting the
bird, and thus render the test worth
less. If the feet are left on the car
cass, they furnish a test of the age.
In a young bird they are soft and
smooth, becoming hard and rough as
the bird grows older. The claws are
short and sharp in a young bird, be
coming longer and blunter with age
and use. The spur above the foot is
also to be observed; when the bird
is very young, like a broiler chicken,
it is hardly apparent; a few months
later it is long, but straight; in a ma
tured bird it is larger still and crookl
ed at the end. It is more developed
in males than in females and capons.

WHAT GOOD CULTURE IS.
In the modern rush for the spray
pump for the alleviation of fruit ills,
some people have forgotten the oldest
and most reliable preventive of dis
ease —good culture. By good culture
is meant the care that the plants
need in order to produce the most
and best fruit. This means, first of
all, well nourished plants If a tree
is healthy and well nourished, like a
man, it is better able to resist and
throw off disease than if poorly
nourished. True, good culture alone
will not keep plants free from dis
ease, but the prevalence of many
diseases is influenced in no small de
gree by the conditions under which
the plants are grown. Give the
plants the care and culture they
need and secure in return more and
better fruit. —Southern Orchards
and Homes.
In a recent monthly report by the
Pennsylvania food and dairy com
mission, the statement is made that
a certajn firm in Italy, “has found a
process by which tomatoes are
evaporated and put into tablet form.
The preparation retains all the fla
vor and all the natural aroma of the
fresh, ripe tomato, which is put up
without any preservatives or color
ing matter whatever, and put up in
a very practical way.’’—Farm and
Ranch.
PLANT SPANISH PEANUTS.
Inspired by his own success in
experiment, Mr. S. M. Maddox, of
Weatherford, Texas, is advising the
farmers of that section to try Span
ish peanuts. Mr. Maddox planted a
little over an acre in 1909, and says
that he reaped therefrom ten wagon
loads of feed that his mules eat in
preference to cdrn. He states fur
ther that fourteen head of hogs
were fattened by rooting up the pea
nuts left after harvesting the crop.
He will plant several acres this year.
—Peanut Journal.
Again we say, do not pledge your
vote to the earliest candidate for the
Legislature, Congress, or county of
fices. Wait until you see who are to
come out and then give your support
to the man who has the most practi
cal and helpful policy for building
up the community and State. Only
in this way can the farmer ever
make his influence count as other
trades and professions make theirs
count. The business man does not
pledge his vote to the first man who
asks him for it, but first demands
what policies the candidates will sup
port, and the candidate really has
contempt for any man who is so
“easy” as not to follow this policy.—
Progressive Farmer and Gazette,
Raleigh, N. C.
Volumes could be written upon
this subject and yet it could not be
covered nor exhausted. It is as full of
meat as an egg. It means in one
word, SUCCESS.
Again we say, that when the farm
ers of the South grow plenty of vege_
tables, meat, corn, fruit, poultry,
mules and THEN some cotton, pros
perity will smile on Dixie from Mary
land to Florida and from Carolina to
Texas.
Don’t let those higher up stuff you
with the advice to increase your pro
duction of cotton, IF IT IS NECES
SARY TO INCREASE YOUR ACRE
AGE. If, by scientific methods, you
can produce two bales where one
used to grow, well and good. Do
not, however, in order to make pne
more bale, plant another’acre in cot
ton..
Those higher up will tell you that
the world is crying for more cotton.
Well, let her cry. The South has
been crying for years for better
prices and the world has turned a
deaf ear on her.
The South’s money crop is cot
ton, and it has a monopoly almost on
its production. “In Dixie Land I
take my stand, to live and die in
Dixie.” The only thing that can ever
take away from the South this great
monopoly is for the farmers to im
poverish their lands and be forced to
leave their farms with their boys
and girls, to toil and spin in the fac
tories which are SURE to come later
on. Read Clarence H. Poe’s article,
“Saving the Rural South to the
White Race,” and heed it. —Farmer’s
News-Scimitar, Memphis, Tenn.

gardens all the year round here in
the South. Many and many a North
ern and Western farmer would pay a
hundred dollars a year for the oppor
tunities for gardening which every
one has in the South and which most
of us neglect. The one supreme
thing to decide on about this year’s
garden is to have a succession of
crops of every vegetable. As soon as
one planting of beans, peas, toma
toes, cucumbers, squashes, potatoes,
or beets has run out, have another
planting coming on.—Progressive
Farmer and Gazette, Raleigh, N. C.
SORE MOUTH IN DOGS.
One of the most frequent ques
tions asked in our veterinary depart
ment is for a remedy for malignant
sore-mouth of dogs. The disease is
very common and usually fatal. The
best remedies which have been sug
gested often utterly fail.
Our own collie developed a critical
case a month ago. Usual remedies
did no good. For two days and
nights we expected the poor creature
to expire any hour. Then we hit
upon what seems to be a real spe
cific for the disease. We washed the
mouth freely with permanganate of
potash—4o grains dissolved in one
half pint o fwater.
Relief followed immediately after
the first application. After the sec
ond —six hours later —the dog ate
broth greedily. The fourth washing
effected a complete cure. —Southern
Ruralist.

Dropsy-
Given up by Doctor
"I had dropsy, and was told
by my family physician that
there was no chance for me. My
family also gave me up. My
limbs and body were swollen
oue-third larger than natural,
water collected around my heart
and I had to be propped up in
bed to keep from smothering. I
took Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy
until I was entirely cured. This
was in 1902, and I am now able
to do any kind of work on my
farm. My cure was certainly
marvelous.”
L. TURLEY CURD,
Wilmore, Ky.
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy has
been wonderfully successful in
relieving heart trouble. Its tonic
effect upon the heart nerves and
muscles is a great factor in
assisting nature to overcome
heart weakness.
Dr. Miles’ Heart Remedy Is sold by
all druggists. If the first bottle does
not benefit, your druggist will return
your money.
