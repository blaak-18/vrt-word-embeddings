The Jeffersonian has been a little
tardy in setting apart a niche in its
columns thjat should be peculiarly
your own, 'mainly for the reason that
we knew, the class of women to whom
such a department would appeal,
would place upon us the responsibil
ity of addressing them “as nobly as
the task is high,” so we hesitated un
til we felt prepared to give to them
our best, and ask from them in re
turn their interest and co-operation.
Our paper is now to be larger and
will steadily widen the scope of its en
deavors. We want tn give the home *
circle each week something worth
while. Above all, we desire to estab
lish a meeting ground for feminine
minds; an intellectual clearing house,
to so speak, where we may exchange
news and views of all things high and
helpful and wholesome.
Won’t you help? >Share your
thoughts with others; give us the ben
efit of your own experiences and our
page will soon be like a bright, breezy
letter from home.

The Jeffersonian has been mindful
always of the progress of womankind.
It is aware that the gentler half of
creation represents what should be
the mightier force for the uplift of
humanity. As the average woman
“thinketh in her heart” so is she,
and so is civilization today. You may
talk of the influence of the bench, the
bar, the pulpit or the press; but it
is the impress of the homekeeper
which is the stamp of our permanent
worth.
It is trite to say that no nation can
be greater than the mothers of its cit
izens, and yet we” need a more vital
awakening to the truth »f this. Even
as food is of no use to the economy
until it has been assimilated, so phil
osophy does not become a power until
incorporated in our own mentality. So
long as beautiful maxims get no deep
er than the lips, the world'will be a
grovelling one. At no time in his
tory has it been so manifestly the
province of womankind to vindicate
the “fine fabling” of the poets in re
gard to the fair sex as is the case to
day. The “woman movement” is
world wide. Is it a divine discontent,
or a sordid restlessness? What does
it all mean? We want the ideas of
all thoughtful readers.
♦ # ♦
Always remember that we should
earnestly seek the truth. In the his
tory of the past and in the actual
conditions of the present we will find
the field for our searching. It is very
easy to have “notions” about every
thing under the sun. To form “opin
ions” requires work, research, good
judgment and, above all, humility.
We must be willing to dig deeply into
subjects and to discard our most cher
ished theories where they do not
square with facts or sound logic.

-Once upon a time, you know, great
universities taught practical sciences
by the ipse dixit method of the great
wranglers of the day. -Students
would drink in the marvelous lectures
with awe, and make reverent notes.
In subdued voices they would discuss
what they had heard and their hearts
swelled with a kind of rapture that to
them had been permitted the inesti
mable privilege of sitting under the
sound of such wisdom. It would have
been deemed ungrateful—nay, impi
ous in the extreme —if the words of
the orators had been put to strict
proof. The very obviousness of some
errors seemed to be as land-marks
warding off inquiry. Practical exper
iment was utterly discouraged and
the scholar was expected to avoid re
search and blindly to accept any mus
ty errors. Curiously enough, much
of this attitude of mind is expected
in woman even today from the ultra
conservative, but fearlessly to combat
error, no matter how long entrenched
in common custom, nor how richly
robed in decorous convention; and
resolutely to check the contra error
of going to mad extremes, should be
the effort of America’s uncrowned
queens.

This, then, is the plane upon which
we will try to pitch our page. If it
pleases YOU, housemother, write us
of” your little family, how you solve
vexatious domestic problems and
wherein lie the sources of your own
joy. If it suits YOU, daughter of the
household, let us hear some of the
dreams of girlhood again. It will do
us good —those beautiful imaginings
—and maybe they will come all the
truer for your giving them expres
sion. The woman in every walk of
life should have something helpful,
entertaining and uplifting to contrib
ute to the cause of mutual inspira
tion and good cheer, and she who.“in
fear and trembling” -essays to edit
this little department, will gladly
welcome and appreciate a letter from
each one of you.
A THOUGHT.
As the little plants draw up all
available substances in their reach
and convert them into a part of their
being; and in return blossom forth, a
well developed tree or plant, giving
forth the odor of sweet flowers or
luscious fruits, aye, in a thousand
ways blessing those around them, and
making the world brighter and more
beautiful, so, oh, God, wilt thou help
me to take in all available material
around me steadily, patiently and
courageously converting it all into a
part of my being, making me sweeter,
more beautiful and of greater ser
vice to all in my work ?—Phoebe Lee.
Jane Adams is said to have a larger
constituency than any college presi
dent in the world. Nine thousand
men, women and children go to Hull
House to attend clubs and classes,
to learn how to cook, to sew, to make
hats, to dance, to paint, to model in
clay, to drink a social cup of tea, to
witness and take part in dramatics,
to study literature, philosophy and
political economy.—-Southern Horse

AT TWILIGHT.
By Anna Walker Doughty.
When the day is spent and the last
gold thread
Os the setting sun embroiders the
view;
When the mock-bird’s quest is a
bower of rest,
What scenes do the shadows paint for
you?
Is there echo laugh of a golden heart
That was waked by love’s sun-kissed
day ?
And a glowing smile, that lingered
awhile,
Till youth bid it pass away?
Does a lisping prayer from the long
gone past
Make the twilight all gold?
Do pattering feet make life more
sweet,
More worth while and less cold?
Do the roses of promise bloom once
more,
Revived by a mist of tears,
As they bloomed long ago, when you
did not know
They would fade with the coming
years?
r
When the last gold thread in the
needle of light,
Is placed in the robe of day,
And the sun sinks .slowly, in silence
holy,
Bearing the glory away,
Thro’ the dim of day and the dim
of years,
Is a song of peace imparted,
And doesn’t it say in a golden way;
God will finish the task you started?
POISE.
If you have ever seen a woman
nervously picking up this thing and
then that, without seeming to know
exactly what she wants to do with
it; or beginning a task only to quit
it almost as soon as begun, you will
know what I mean 'by mental confu
sion.
On the other hand, if you have
seen another woman pick up an arti
cle with a definite purpose in view,
or complete a task before beginning
another; if you know a woman who
sets about any undertaking calmly,
earnestly and thoughtfully, then you
will understand in a measure the
meaning of mental poise.
Some one has said that self-control
is thought-control, and we might add
to this that thought-control is no
more nor less than mental poise—
a state which is absolutely essential
to health, happiness and success.
The woman who habitually gets her
hat on awry, unless it is a freak
“concoction” without definite front,
sides or back, who buttons her dress
crooked; whose cooking is a mere
conglomeration of this, that and the
other thing, with no suggestion as to
the tastes or needs of the members of
she household; whose house is always
in disorder; whose dress is a combi-
nation of many colors; who begins
a piece of embroidery today, does a
bit of tatting tomorrow, knits a lit"
tie the next day, and seldom or never
completes anything—you may be as
sured that she is sadly lacking in
mental poise.
When your mind is confused, my
friends, the muscles and nerves be
come confused, and you are soon con
scious of floundering about, unable to
quickly and satisfactorily complete
the simplest details, while every
nerve seems to be at the highest ten
sion.
Again, you are trying to do two or
more tasks at one time, or endeavor
ing to finish something too hurriedly.
“But,” you say, “I am a very
busy woman, and I must do ray work
in this manner in order to get
through with it.”
Now let us suppose that a child
comes home from school and says:
“Mother, I am taking five branches;
and, that I may prepare my lessons
for tomorrow, it will be necessary to
study them all at the same time to- ♦
night. ’ ’
Or suppose a merchant says:
“Here come ten customers; I shall
have to serve them all at once.”
Do you not see how utterly absurd
and impractical your position is?
“What shall 1 do, then?” you ask.
Well, first of all, relax, and get
your mental equilibrium. In order to
do this it may be necessary, and in
all probability will be wise, for you
to walk out in the fresh air for half
an hour or so, and breathe deeply
to acquire this state of relaxation, or,
iU may be better to lie down and close
your eyes for ten or fifteen minutes,
breathing deeply, of course —thinking
as little as possible, and only of some
thing pleasant.
By doing this, you will find your
self in condition to take up the du
ty which lies nearest or which is the
most pressing, and, with mind con
centrated upon it, keep at it until it
is finished. Then take up the next in
the same manner, and so on to the
end.
At the close of the day, or in the
morning before entering upon the
activities which require your atten
tion, list the tasks according to their
importance, and give each one in its
turn your entire attention as if there
were not another one for the day.
If you have never tried this you
cannot imagine the restful feeling,
the confidence, and the strength of
mind and body which will come to
you; and you will be surprised at
the ease and satisfaction with which
the manifold duties may be dis
patched. You will find, also, that you
have not only ample time for all that
you have hitherto felt must be done
(a part of whic halways lapped over
from day to day), but that you may
easily accomplish much more, and
really feel refreshed when night .
comes; for mental poise means phy
sical poise, and the two are product
ive of health, strength and beauty—=
all of which are essential to the well
balanced woman. —Alice M. Long, in
Woman’s Work.
