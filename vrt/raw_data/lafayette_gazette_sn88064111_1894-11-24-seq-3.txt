Tuesday night Sheriff Broussard
was wired to look out for two
negro fugitives and finding two
strangers who corresponded with
descriptions, he arrested them and
conducted them to the Crescent
News lunch stand to be examined
more closely. After entering the
room with the officer, the negroes
started to run out and as the sheriff
held on to them and refused to let
go his grip, he was struck a power
ful blow near the ear. The sheriff
was stunned, but soon recovered I
and drew his pistol in time to es
cape an other blow from the negro,
who, frightened by the weapon, took
to his heels and followed his part
ner, but both were soon captured.
Duringthe chase the sheriff fired two
or three shots one ball striking the
arm of the negro who made the as
sault. The negroes gave their
names as George and Joseph Guice.
One one of them was found a pis
tol. Proper charges were made
and they were locked up awaiting
further developments.
New Comers.
Through the persistent efforts of 1
that progressive gentleman, Mr. J.
R. Nickerson, a number of sturdy
farmers of the west will find homes
in our parish. Three famalies ar
rived Tuesday from North Dakota
and Mr. Nickerson is about to lo
cate them in different parts of the
parish. A. Rirycrse, Patrick Mc
Cann and J. Riryerse are the names
of the gentlemen who have already
come and judging fr, m thci: fine
stock and improved farming imple
ments they are practical farmers of
some means. A letter from Mr.
J.- A. Ellis, of the same State, says
that he soon will lead another party,
and should they find suitable places
here The Gazette is informed that
200 or 300 families, who are dissat
isfied with their present homes, are
desirous of coming to Lafayette in
search of a milder clime and better
soil. 1 Mr. Nickerson tells us that he
will do all in his power to" induce
these people to settle in our parish
as they are industrious and intelli
gent and will prove desirable citi
zens.
Fire at New Iberia.
Our neighboring town, New
Iberia, has in the last few years,
suffered very much from fire. She
was the victim of a $25,ooo fire last
Sunday, and as the circumstances
were such as to arouse the suspic
ions of the people about its origin
an investigation made by the au
thorities *resulted in the arrest of
two parties. Speaking of the arrest,
the Enterprise says: "Schmidt &
Goldman, in whose store the fire
originated, have been arrested,
charged with arson. They were
arrested Monday night and are still
held in custody, awaiting an ex
amination. As usual, in cases of
this kind, the evidence is all cir
cumstantial. Up to recently, the
firm carried insurance to the amount
of $35o00 with the agencies of R. H.
Cage aud Gates & Craig. This
they cancelled under the plea that
the buil(ding in which they were was
fire proof and the expense of insur
ance was unnecessary and business
dull. It has since developed, how
ever, that two policies, of $5ooo
each, have been taken out through
the Robertson agency, both for
ninety days, the last of which was
taken out on Saturday, the day be
fore the fire. It is to be hoped, if
the men are guilty, that the evidence
of their crime may be fully devel
oped and that they may be made to
suffer the full penalty of the law."

Happenings in the Busy and
Thrifty Town - Reported
for the Columns of The
Gazette.
The slaughter of the Democrats,
like the massacre of the Armenians,
is sadly deplored. Notwithstand
ing the Republican avalanche that
swept the Union, Louisianians may
justly feel proud of the good
work done by their State. We are
all right, considering matters from
a political point of view; but, what
about the hard times blankly staring
us in the face? Where is the reme
dy and how apply the treatment ?
It is too well-known that cotton at
present prices brings ruin and in
debtedness to the producer. There
fore, cotton must be given a wide
berth. And sugar cane; should it
be cultivated in the future in Lafa
yette ? Past experience, we be
lieve, ;is convinced the farmers
that there is no money in that cul
ture. What is to be done? Can
any one answer? Much to our re
gret, quite a number of our friends, I
the farmers, yet entertain the anti
bellum notion that cotton is the I
only plant to which our lands are
adapted. This is a serious error,
as Lafayette's fertile and rich lands
are specially adapted to many
plants, and such being the case
we see no reason why something[
else should not be given a trial.
North Louisiana has awakened,
and steps are now being taken to
solve this question. A packing]
house and plant, is a new industry
to be started shortly at Monroe.
This venture we feel convinced,
will prove a success, as Kansas
City, St. Louis and other cities are
simply coining money at that busi
ness. Now, Southwest Louisiana,
what do you intend to do? Now
Lafayette capitalists, come out with
your dollars, and prove to the farm
ers that you have their wellfare at
heart. Corn and potatoes are
raised in this and adjoining par- .
ishes with most gratifying results to
anyone attempting an effort. Hogs, 1
with enough corn, are raised as well
and probably better here than in
the West, and with the essentials
necessary for the support of the
packing house, there is no reason
imaginable why such an enterprise
would not prove profitable to the a
farmer and packer. Only a just
and fair trial is all that is asked. t
"Say mister, please give me the
results of the last election?" Such
a question was propounded last
week by a "culled gentleman," who
once figured prominently in the
politics of the parish. After ex
plaining to the blackman how mer
cilessly the Republican party had
been buried in the State, that disap
pointed worthy sighed heavily, and
departed murmuring the following
words: "'Oh, Lord I kindly pro
tect my much abused hide from an
other "clouc-clouc" visit. I swear
to thee, that from now and here
after I drop all future connections
with political matters. Amen !"

What Becomes Of Old Men?
Walter Blackburn Harte has a
short humorous paper in the No
vember Arena on "'The Advent of
the Young Man." He raises the
the question half humorously, half
seriously, "What Become of the
Old Men?" since a man is consid
ered old at forty nowadays. I e
suggests pleasantly that the secret
of the silent disappearance of mid
dile aged and old men from all call
ings and professions may lie in the
growing relish among Americans
for frankfurters and sauer kraut.
It is an amusing paper, with enough
salt of truth in it to give its ludi
crousness point and pungency.
Instead of being the destroyer,
Mr. Cleveland has kept the Demo
cratic party afloat the past three
years, and instead of making him a
scapegoat Democrats should thank
him for what he has done for them.
Democrats ought to feel grateful to
him that their defeat was no worse.
-New York Herald.
No worse! Is it possible that it
could have been worse? While we
don't know if the president should
be blamed for what has happened
we don't exactly know what it is
we beleive it is adding insult to in
jury to tell a Democrat that it could
have been worse.
WV. B. Roberts, editor of the
Patterson Optic, shot and killed
Maturian Lenian at- Ffanklin last
Wednesday. Both men were dis
cussing politics when a difficulty
arose and pistols came into play
with the above result. Dispatches

Roberts acted in self-detence.
Sir Thomas More And Democracy.
In the November Arenta, B. O.
Flower, the editor of the Review,
begins a series of paper on "The
Century of Sir Thomas More,"
which promises well. In this in
troductory paper he deals with the
new Learning North of the Alps,
consequent upon the fall of Con
stantinople in 1453, and the disper
sion of the Greek scholars through
out Italy and Northern Europe.
The object of these papers is to
trace the influences in social life
and thought at work in that time,
especially in England, and those at
work in our own time, which the
author thinks presents many start
ling analogies. Our day too is go
ing through its spiritual and intel
lectual renaissance, and is breaking
away from old social traditions to
enter Uapon a uw ,oeiai civi~aation.:
