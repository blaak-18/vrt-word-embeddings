woman to carry her purse in her

by a thief. To one end of the purse is
attached a ring, which is slipped over
the middle finger, and to the other a

thief cannot very well get away with
it, unless he takes the lady too.

MR. WIGGLESWORTH.
IIERE: It is"'. glee
fully cried Mr. Wig
glesworth, running
to the window.
Mrs. Wiggles
worth followed in
a flutter. It was
her birthday, and
she'd been hoping
since morning that
her husband would
rememtber it. She
saw a fat, red-faced

"What is it?" echoed Mr. Wiggl-s
wa rth, sr.artly. "it's a horse, of course.

farm mortgage. did't you?"
".e\nd did you get It for me?" chirped
.Mrs. \\'igglesworth, clapping her
hands. "Oh. how good of you. Ellery.
to remember that it was my birthday!"
o, she kissed her husband on his whis
kers-women love to kiss their hus
bands on their whiskers-and, putting
an apron over her head, she followed
him out of doors. The tall sorrel horse
had his nose in the air and was wrink
ling his lips back over his forehead In
a peculiar fashion. Now and then he
would thrust one foot out toward the
horizon in an impromptu way, and look
disappointed when the red-faced man
turned out to be elsewhere.
"Where'll I put him?" asked the red
faced man. He also had a hoarse voice
that rumbled, and at the sound of
which the tall horse would stand up in
the air till he felt the red-faced man's
fat form at the end of the halter, and
then he would come down again, reah
ing for the red-faced man as he did so.
but, unfortunately, missing him ag_.-.
After some trouble the animal was got
Into a stall in the little stable and the
red-faced mat, went away, while the
hired girl came out and gathered up the
lineful of clothes that had been cast
down and stepifed on.
"You see. It is this way." Mr. Wig
glesworth explained, as they were eat
ing supper. "I thought it would be a
good thing for you to have a horse

I went to a man I know and told him
just what I wanted, and he's sent up
just the thing-a woman's driving

Quite a surprise, wasn't it?" he added.
with the pride that a man takes in do
ing a thing without consulting his wife.
"Oh, it's too ifbtful for anything!"
cooed Mrs. W lssworth. '"But do you
think I can drl  him? Doesn't he
seem rather-E--tall? Not so awfully
tall," she hasild to add, noting her
husband's falling countenance, "but

Go-"
Mrs. Wigglesworth was a woman who
could be roused to momentous situa
tions. She came down from the stairs
and waved her apron gently.
"Shoo!" she said to the sorrel horse.
"That's it!" her husband cried. "that's
the way to shoe a horse!" and ghastly as
the humor seemed to be. he found him
self smiling at it. But his wonder re
doubled when the sorrel horse, after
looking at Mrs. Wigglesworth for a
moment with a surprised air, slipp'ld
demurely down from the edge of the
stall and began scratching his ne4q re
flectively on the manger.
"There you are," said Mrs. Wiggles
worth, climbing down from the box and
cautiously approaching the ttall. The
animal had his eyes closed, and Mr.
Wigglesworth, as he took hold of the
halter, remembering his suspender.
co, ld not forbear giving it a vicious lit
tle jerk.
What followed Mrs. VWiggleswoith ex
plained to the doctors. The tall sorrel.
she said, when he felt the jerk. seemed
to turn and shot a hasty but astonished
look at her husband. Mr. Wiggles
worth's hands appeared to be glued to
the halter, she said, for when the sorrel
stood up on his hind legs and walked
out of the stall, Mr. Wigglesworth came
with him, swinging back and forth like
the pendulum to a clock, only faster.
When the sorrel got out on the barn
floor, he looked around for Mrs. Wig
glesworth, but failing to discover her.
at first, he performed a few complicated
dance movements, such as a circus
horse makes., leaving portions of Mr.
Wigglesworth's clothing and cuticle
upon the studding and rafters of the
stable as he went along. Then he put
his hands around that gentleman and
'harged out of doors. The hired girl had
Just time to look over her shoulder and
:ee the procession coming, and then
Irop her clothes basket and crawl under
the stoop. When the sorrel horse came
lown again, missing the hired girl by an
inch, he put his off hind foot through the
clothes basket and bore it away with
him.
It made one of the best Items of news
the local papers ever had, and even got
-9pled into a city daily with cuts. Peo
ple coming out of their houses would see
.Mr. Wigglesworth every few minutes
going into the air, and then coming
town again, closely followed by the sor
rel harse, with his leg thrust through
the basket, and accumulating mud
which ever and anon he would shake off
upon the bystanders as he went hust;ing
past.
Half an hour later Mr. Wigglesworth
-ll bed slowly up t lltoop. a fragment

h Ing in his hand.
"My darling, darling Ellery?" sobbed
'its wife, 'with a pale face, tottering for
'ard.
"Don't ye fall on me!" warned Mr.
Wigglesworth, the passionate lines on
its face growing deeper: "don't ye come
whining around here asking for any
nore family horses warranted to stand
without hitching! The kind of family
horse you want is a gentle, long-eared
lonkey, and blamed if I don't wish
you'd got one before you ever saw me!"
And in explaining it afterward to the
an acos the way, Mrs. Wiggles

OPIUM FIENDS IN CONVENTIONI
They MYet to Oppose a Bill Pendlog itr
the iaassachusetts Legislature..
Fully 300 Chinese opium-smokers
representing New England. assembled
themselves at 24 Oxford street Flrid,.
night for the purpose of finding way
to stop the Quinn bill, which is nov
pending before the General Assembly
says the Boston Herald. The meetini
commenced at 8 o'clock and lasted un
til after midnight. Every member
seemed to be talking at the same time,
and consequently, there seemed to be
more speakers than listeners. Reso
lutions were passed that a petition be
sent to the Assembly, asking that if
Mr. Quinn wanted a bill to pass against
the smoking of opium, an exception be
made in favor of the Chinese com
munities.
"There is no man under God's crea
tion that knows the hardships which
smokers .endure," said one of the dele
gates from Hartford. "If Mr. Quinn iÃ½
an intelligent and free-minded gentle
man he should take conscientious con
sideration before he made such a law
as would stop a person from smoking
when the smoker has had the habit
for thirty years."
"We are bound to smoke, anyhow,
whether we have the right or take it
for granted," said another smoker from
Providence, R. I. "We committed the
sin before the law was made and we
are compelled to sin after the law is
made. We must either sin o must
stop living."
The most interesting em rks
throughout the meeting were made by
Li Sam, who came to the convention
as a representative from New Bedford.
He said: "People who do not smoke
will never know a smoker's troubles. I
had the habit grow into me for the
past thirty-seven long years. I have
tried and tried again to stop smoking,
but my strength failed me. At last I
gathered up my nerve to try again for
the last time. I decided if I failed to
do what I pledged I would-die a fiend.
Two weeks ago I stopped smoking for
twenty-four hours. My dear fellow
men, there are not enough words in
Confucius' dictionary to tell yon how I
felt. I had rather have all the devils
in the great hell torment me than to
take the right of smoking away from
me. We smoking men do not ask the
people to encourage us, but we would
ask the public pity."
HOW MUCH FRANCE DRINKS.
One of the "Things They do Bettes
Over There."
Paris is mainly a wine-drinking
town, but, like Marseilles and Lyons,
does not consume so much as many of
the smaller towns, though when ex
amined in detaU e provisions seems
to be on a sufficiently generous scale,
says Chambers' Journal. In Paris the
annual rate per head Is 340 pints of
wine, 16 of cider, 21 of beer and rather
over 12 pints per head of spirits. In
whisky-drinking Scotland the annual
rate per head of whisky consumption
was, in 1892-3, just a little over 12%
pints-little more that the proportion
of spirits demanded by the Parisians.
without regard to thd large quantity
of wine also required here for their an
wants. In view of this, it is
. age that traveleg still report that
drunkenness-as we unfortunately
sew il Great Britain-is a thing of
occurrence. The Parisians
asented as temperate drinkers,
toaugh they drink just about as many
itses." as the Scotch (the
largest m of spirits in Britain).
beag mes as many glasses
ei do of spirits, not t
Speasot'a -allowance of cider and
bel And at Cherbourg the inhabi
tants take two and three-quarter times
as ach spirits as the Scotch, not to
of cider, beer and wine. As it
is to be hbed and presumed that wom
en and childrea have little or nothing
to do with the figures for the consump
tion of ppirits, and as very many men
take none at all, some folks must take
pretty large doses. If French top
can, without risible and unpleasant
consequences, carry such quantities of
liquor, this m one of the "thing,
they do better 1-rsnce."
