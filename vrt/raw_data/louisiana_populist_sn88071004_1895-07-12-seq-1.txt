SILVER MOVEMENT AN EFFORT di
TO DIVIDE POPULISTS. i.
mi
pa
If the Free Coinage eImocrats Desire wi
Succecss Let Them Eallet Under the pa
Clean, Bright Banner of the People's hi
Party and March to Victory.
01
If the Populists adhere to their or- at
ganization as they should do. and as tb
it is their duty to themselves, their
political brethren and the country to )e
do, there is but little doubt of their la
success in Texas and many other
states in state elections, and of weild- if
ing a controlling influence in the di
selection of the next president and tt
securing the popular branch of con
gress.
lFidelity to party (declarations of
principle. authoritatively and honest
ly made. is a \irtue, and to stand by w
comrades in the tight that is waged c
in support of such declarations is no it
less a virtue. lie is a traitor who
flies to the foe for pelf, gain, place or
power-a very poltroon who, under w
the the circumstances named, evades a
the field and who fails to carry the
banner high aloft. tI
There are times when it is political
wisdom and patriotic to combine with u
an enemy to beat back and destroy a n
greater one, but this is not the year, a
the day nor the hour when Populists
can afford to go to the aid of, or act p
with, any of the parties heretofore op
posed to them. It would be the de
struction of their party and political I
suicide to the individual.
The Populist organization, and the Â°
tenacity, the undying faith with
which they hold to the truth, expe
diency and justice free and un
limited coinage of silver at the old t
ration has been the heart in which
the life blood of that principle pul
sated for these many years, while
Democrats abandoned iteand Republi- i
cans denounced it. It is their princi
ple. They rescued it from under the
feet and from the stilletto of the old 1
parties. Why should they now,
I when the principle has grown into t
manhood-a giant in and of itself-
take a second place and let those who
would have seen it perish, lead to
victory through, by and because of its
strength? No, that would not be hon
eat, right nor just from any standpoint.
If free silver Democrats, who are
now so enthusiastic, desire the suc
cess of free unlimited coinage of sil
ver, if they wish to be parties to the
r establishment of a great American
- policy, let them come uuder the Pop
ulist banner and march with us to
victory. They cannot, without ef
frontery, seek to lead our hosts to
t battle. A cloud no bigger than a
p man's hand has grown until it is cov
t ering the whole heavens from the
lakes to the seashores, from the ocean
on the east to that on the west.
We can lead our own hosts and
carry them through the storm of con
flics to the mount of victory. This is
no time for fraternization with one
enemy or another; it would bring de
moralization,confusion and defeat; the
a combination mightsucceed, but Popu
lism would die. Don't be deceived, my
, friends! There is no love for you with
- silver Democrats; by them you are
- mocked, decried, criticised and ridi
culed. They will, if you will permit
them, make instruments of you to beat
If the Republicans and the single gold
standard people, but what then? You
1are swallowed up in the vortex. Your
. enemy flourishes and you pass into
nothingness. Don't tell me that the
free silver Democrats are friendq of the"
Populists. It is not so. The man
who so believes, the man who acts
under such belief, fatally deceives
Id himself, and to the whole extent of
Shis individuality and influence ruins
Shis party and defeats the objects and
f purposes of his political friends. Be
Snot deceived! If these silver Demo
crats love the free silver doctrine you
Steach and support, they will come to
1 you. If they be honest men, honestly
l advocating the doctrine, they will
come to you politically and 'as patri
e otic men; they dare not stay away.

ized foe? G(;od grant that our every E'
man may be ablaze with the fire of Is
patriotism, devoted to the truth, filled hi
with fidelity to his cause and com- W
panions, and as fixed as the stars in T
his unalterable determination to look *I
for victory only in the ranks of his w
own party. -
But I have a word to say to the sil-, w
ver Democrats. I am not a prophet, cI
and yet I see, as clearly as a prophet. b
that which is to come to you. Be on b
your guard. Your destruction is de
creed, and naught but sleepless vigi
lance and the honesty of your own
convictions will or can save you. even
if these can, which is much to be
doubted. (f course I am talking to
the common people, the laborers, the
producers. The politician, the wire
worker, the place hunter, the self
constituted leader can and will take
care of themselves. They are they
who mislead the people and ruin the
country: but to the common people.
it is to them I speak.
The coming political contest of l 96
will be more %irulent, accrimonious
and desperate than any heretofore
witnessed. The gold power is deter- a
mined. It's mind is made up. In it v
there will be no change. It has made a
up its mind to win the fight and con- s
trol the destinies of the country, no s
matter at what cost of treasure, aye, I
and of blood. What cares it for the u
people? IWhat is it to the brazen i
power whether the people eat or t
starve, are warm or cold, live or die? i
There are gradations in that power.
It has jesuitic system, deliberate 1
method and deeply planed policy. It
bends or breaks those it assaults. a
The gold power owns and controls the
national banks. The national banks,
as a rule subordinate the merchants of
the towns and cities, while the people Âº
universally are in debt to the mer- I
chants. Now watch the movement.
The gold power orders the banks: the
banks request the merchants, and the
merchants solicit their debtors to I
pursue one line of action, and
what is that? Yes, what is
that? It is this: To permit I
the gold power advocates to
capture the primaries and the con
ventions, and thus enable that power
to declare its views as to the princi
ples of the party. To this end the
order, the request and the solicitation,
if necessary, will go to the extent
that the banker, the merchant, and
the debtor, must go into the primar
ies, and the conventions, and work to
accomplish the designated purposes.
Thus it was worked in the last pri
maries and state conventions. The
gold power let the silver men have
the offices but it took for its share
the declarations of principles.
In the state conorention there
was more than 150 majority of dele
gates in favor of free silver, but the
gold standard delegates succeeded in
their aim. True the candidates who
were nominated were sometimes on
the platform, sometimes under it,
sometimes jumping on and off, but
they were gold power candidates and
e silver men voted for them. Just get
a collar on a silver Democrat and that's
all that is necessary to make him per
form like a trick mule in a circus or
a cinnamon bear mastered by a Dago
tramp. I say this more in sorrow and
it grief than in blame and criticism.
The Democratic party, the masses, the
d people of the party, not the ringmas
ters, wanted a free silver platform and
gr got a gold standard one. So it will be
again unless you in time detect the
fraud and prevent it. The way to do
so is to consort with those of your own
kind. Sheep don't run with wolves,
or if they do the wolves do the eating
and the sheep furnish the banquet. A
fword to the wise ought to be sufficient,
but it may be that silver Democrats
like to be fooled. All right But let
Sme tell you one thing, the Populists
are not going with you to be sacrificed
on the golden altar. They have be

, our dirt. You can have it all, for
t' he Populist from principle is going
to stay on his platform, fight from
there and not be the dupe of any sup
porter of a two-faced party.
The Populists to-day hold the bal
Sance of power against the administra
Stion views on the money question, and
if a combination becomes necessary to

act as a party and not as individuals.
