IN SPECIAL SESSION.
A Consolidation of Two Departments
of the City.
At a special session of the city coun
cil held Friday night the street sprink
ling and cleaning department, recently
created at the suggestion of the mayor,
was, on the recommendation of the same
official, consolidated with the improve
ment department. The street sprinkling
and cleaning department was experi
mental, and since its creation it has be
come manifest that economy and effi
ciency could be secured through the
consolidation of the authority necessary
to their operations. Under the revised
plan of operation the street commission
er will be held responsible for its manl
agement and he is authorized to employ
an assistant whose salary is fixed at $75
per month.
It may now be said that this street
sprinkling and cleaning should have
been operated under the authority of the
street commissioner, but there is noth
ing so easy as to point out mistakes
which have become visibly apparent. It
is always unfortunate that, according to
the old negro's saw: "Our fo' sight is
not so good as the ind' sight." But in
this progressive age we live to learn and
to improve. This move by the council is
in the right direction and will be ap
proved by the people.
ISRAEL W. PICKENS.
One of the old citizens of Caddo par
ish, Israel W. Pickens, has been called
to eternal 'rest. He died at his home
near Stimmer Grove Thursday night.
His life's record is clean and clear. He
was a man, and in every sphere was
guided by principle and duty. As others,
when a y.bng man he enlisted in the
service of our beloved Southland, and
when the hands of the vile usurper, in
the days .of reconstruction, had tar
nished the fair name of Louisiana, he,
as others, was at the front, in the con
tention of right against might, the pow
er of the Federal government, which
finally terminated in The triumph of law
and order and the restoration of the
rule of intelligence and white suprem
acy. While he had been honored with
political recognitibn, and as a good citi
zen was always active in every move
ment having a tendency to advance the
material interests and the progress of
his section and his State, his life work
was devoted to agricultural pursuits, ,
He was the father of a large family, and
as a husband and father he was indul
gent, kind and affectionate, exemplary {
in his devotion-to his loved ories. In =
his frieidship he was true and always l
considerate. But he is no more. A host
of his friends paid him the last tribute
of respect at io o'clock Saturday morn- i
ing at the burial in the Pickens cemn- a
etery on the Fairfield road near Shreve- r
port.

REDUCTION. OF SALARIES,
The Official Knife Was Applied Most
Effectively.
It was only recenltly that the Caucas
ian, commenting on the generosity of
the council in their raise of the salaries
of officials, suggested in all kindness a
revision of action in keeping with the
principles which are applied to business
affairs. It was evident, on second
thought, that the majority of the coun
cil had been misled on a plea senti
mental, which is apt to influence the
best of men in good motives, but when
the council realized that the aggregated
salaries were beyond reasonable limits,
the council as men of honor and officials
identfied with the best interests of the
community, determined on a reconsid
eration of their action, and accordingly
met Friday night at "which meeting it
was agreed that the salaries be reduced
as follows: Auditor Hayes is allowed
$25 per month extra compensation as
secretary to the mayor and clerk of the
various committees. His salary is fixed
in the charter at $1200oo per annum. City
ateorney $15o per month, reduced from
$166.66. City engineer $175 per month,
reduced from $2oo. Chief of fire depart
ment was unchanged, being $i25. The
office of superintendent of street clean
ing and sprinkling, salary. $125, was
abolished and consolidated with the
street commissioner's department and
fixed at $75 per month.
These reductions are to be effective
on and from June I, next.
This spirit of economy will also be
approved by the taxpayers.
s A SKUNK SKINNER.
A little pimple necked dude, whose
great grandfather made a barrel of
I money skinning muskrats and' selling
i skunk skins, is to be married soon at
- Newport, and the New York Sunday
papers have for months been full o1
goo goo talks abcut it. The sterling ad
vocate of Jeffersonian simplicity, the
New York American, has printed acres
of pictuers of the bride's lingerie, and
the groom's entire wardrobe, from his
pajamas to his toothpick case have been
gorgeously illustrated in all the picture
papers. We are growing to be a very
democratic nation-nit.-Crowley Sig
nal.
When the $ $ $ is the badge 6f meas
urement without regard to excellence
of character, we may say why object to
a descendant of a skunk skinner with
money to throw at birds, cutting a so
ciety dash and having acres of matter
printed in newspapers about him and his
lingerie. In his dashings and cuttings of
"pigeon wings," this relic of a skinner
of skunks could retort that his pedigree
is as good as that of the Yankee nigger
stealer and slave trader whose grandson
may piow be a high roller in perhaps the
social "4o00." We will admit there is
some difference in the breed of skunks,
one of which is tailless and walk on two
feet, but it is uncharitable to draw
odious comparisons, and we should not
forget the story of the pot and the
kettle hanging over the- same fire and
which were equally black and smutty.
LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE A
SOURCE OF SUCCESS.
Clement a. Grisconi is typical of that
class of Americans who, starting without
wealth or influence, have become cap
tains of industry by sheer force of hard
work consistently directed toward one
end. He is one of the richest men in the
United States, yet he began life with
practically no capital other than good
blood and wholesome habits.
His success, says a writer in the May
Cosmopolitan, has been due to several
things. Singleness of purpose, business
tact, perseverance, infinite capacity for
hard work-all have played a part in it.
But with these has gone yet anothet
quaity-the ability to look into the fi
ture ,asnd to imagine how things are go
ing to be.

STREET PAVINO.
A:n Imiportant Question Which Cmn

.lI--i..i ltitg l',>'c liet ',r the p. ill.
Ind until it is l d. tht que ti':l ,f
the governor and State pdliti,' n t
.tani side-tracked!. Indeed. it i, o,
early to indulge in a p;litical campaign.
The bird who is out too early may ciatch
the early worm, if out, blut the earlyv
bird may becnme very werried and
hungry if the expected early worms
should not come out. There is a point
or a moral in this. Think of it and ap
ply it. Street paving being the main and
only issue is deserving of all attention.
The meeting of citizens held at the
Board of Trade at the suggestion of
Mayor Querbes was timely,. and the line
of action adopted may be commended
highly. It is only through intelligent and
decisive action that success may be se
cured in any movement. The proposition
to pave the streets should be carried.
No intelligent citizen should object to
progress, even if its effect be not direct
ly beneficial to him. If the proposition to
pave the streets were defeated, such
misfortune would operate as a setback;
indeed it would be detrimental in the
sense of its construction by capitalists
and investors, as opposition to develop
ment, but we do not anticipate defeat.
But the best safeguard is interest and
vigilance, activity and decisive action
directed intelligently. Nor should any
citizen object to the proposition because
their property already abuts on paved
streets, and as reasonable men they
should be willing and ready to extend
their influence in support of a move
ment through which others may reap
the advantages and the benefits which
they now enjoy and which they have se
cured through the liberality of a pro
gressive community.
A MUSICAL RECITAL.
At the Opera House Monday Night,
May II.
Lovers of music will be given an op
portunity on Monday night, May Ii. of
hearing Mrs. Adah Hollingsworth-Wat
kins of New York in selections which
will not fail to be delightful. This
charming singer is one of the best and
has received the highest and most flat
tering encomiums from critics in the
New York City press. Mrs. Hollings
worth-Watkins will give "Three Cen
turies of American Ballads" in costume,
consisting of folk songs and English
ballads. Her program is excellent and
her voice is a wonderful soprano, finely
cultivated and possessing a singular gift
of expression. .Mrs. Hollingsworth
Watkins will be recalled pleasantly by
her many friends throughout this section
by whom they were frequently delighted
during her residence in this city before
her marriage and her removal to New
York, where she has been perfected in
her art by the best masters. It is gratify
ing to state that Miss Clara V. Prescott
has been invited to be the accompanist
and perhaps will accept on the recital
night. Miss Prescott is a most charming
and accomplished pianist 'who not long
since received in New York a compli
mentary recognition from one of the
most eminent musical artists in that city.
