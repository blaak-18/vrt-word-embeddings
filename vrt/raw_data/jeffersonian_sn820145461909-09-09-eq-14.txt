THE GYPSY TRAIL.
The white moth to the closing vine,
The bee to the open clover,
And the gypsy blood to the gypsy blood
Ever the wide world over.
Ever the wide world over, lass,
Ever the trail held true,
Over the world and under the world,
And back at the last to you.
Out of the dark of the gringo camp,
Out of the grime and the gay,
(Morning waits at the end of the world),
Gypsie, come away!
The wild boar to the sun-dried swamp,
The red crane to her reed,
And the Romany lass to the Romany
lad
By the tie of a roving breed.
Morning waits at the end of the world
Where winds unhaltered play,
Nipping the flanks of their plunging
ranks
Till the white sea horses neigh.
The pied snake to the rifted rock,
The buck to the stony plain,
And the Romany lass to the Romany
lad
And both to the road again.
Both to the road again, again!
Out of a clean sea-track —
Follow the cross of the gypsy trail
Over the world and back!
Follow the Romany patteran
North where the blue bergs sail,
And the bows are gray with the frozen
spray
And the masts are shod with mail.
Follow the Romany patteran
Sheer as the Astral light,
Where tUe besom of God is the wild
west wind,
Sweeping the sea-floor white.
Follow the Romany patteran
West to the sinking sun,
Till the junk sails lift through the
houseless drift,
And the east and west are one.
Follow the Romany patteran
East where the silence broods
By a purple wave on an opal beach
In the hush of the Mahim woods.
The night-hawk to wind-swept sky,
The deer to the wholesome wold,
And the heart of a man to the heart of
a maid
As it was in the days of old.
The heart of a man to the heart of a
maid—
Light of my tents, be fleet;
Morning waits at the end of the world,
And the world is all at our feet.
—Rudyard Kipling.
A BROTHER EDITOR’S TRIBUTE.
Editor Jeffersonian; —Your article
on Foreign Missions in the August
Jeffersonian is a “clincher.”
The “missionaries” may as well
own up that you have them where
they can’t move without putting their
foot in it.
Your article is the most powerful
arraignment of the “unnatural, un
christian and unpatriotic” methods
used by modern missionaries in for
eign lands that was ever written. No
other man in America could or would
do it. And yet it is absolutely and
imperiously necessary. You have
shown up the hideous character of
Popery and the false character of a
large part of “Protestantism” in a
manner which will receive the heart
felt thanks of all true patriots and
nerve them to greater vigilance in be
half of civil and religious liberty.
May your life be spared to carry
on this tremendous work to a suc
cessful issue.
I am with you to the end.

“By George, I never saw anything
like the effects of that new treatment,
Protone, for the building up of weight
and lost nerve force. It acted more
like a miracle than a medicine,” said
a well known gentleman yesterday in
speaking of the revolution that had
taken place in his condition. “I be
gan to think that there was nothing
on earth that could 'make me fat. I
tried tonics, digestives, heavy eating,
diets, milk, beer and almost everything
else you could think of, but without
result. I had been thin for years, and

Recover Normal Weight By the Re
markable New Treatment, Protone.
began to think it was natural for me
to be that way. Finally I read about
the remarkable processes brought
about by the use of Protone, so I de
cided to try it myself. Well, when I
look at myself in the mirror now, I
think it is somebody else. I have put
on just 30 pounds during the last
month and never felt stronger or more
'nervy’ in my life.”
Protone is a powerful Inducer of nu
trition, increases cell-growth, makes
perfect the assimilation of food, in
creases the number of blood-corpus
cles, and as a necessary result builds
up muscles and solid, healthy flesh, and
rounds out the figure.
For women who can never appear
stylish in anything they wear because
of their thinness, this remarkable
treatment may prove a revelation. It
is a beauty maker as well as a form
builder and nerve strengthener.
It will cost you nothing to prove the
remarkable effects of this treatment.
It is absolutely non-injurious to the
most delicate system. The Protone
Company, 1530 Protone Bldg., Detroit,
Mich., will send to anyone who sends
name and address, a free 50c package
of Protone, with full instructions, to
prove that it does the work. They
will also send you their book on “Why
You Are Thin,” free of charge, giving
facts which will probably astonish you.
