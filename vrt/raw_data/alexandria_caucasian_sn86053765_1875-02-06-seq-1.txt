Grammar in a Nutshell
Tho annexed efhision does not
come under the head of new inven
tions and recent discoveries, in fact
we believe it] has been' published
from time to time during the past
twenty years. Bnt, as the Com
mercial A d réaliser ( where it appear
ed last) says: "Tho name of tliu
author should not have been allow
ed to sink into oblivion. On tho
contrary, ho deserves immortality,
and tho gratitude of generations
yet unborn, for wo have never met
with so complete a grammar of tho
English language in so small a
space, Old, as well as young,
should commit these lines to mem
ory, for by their aid it will be diffi
cult, il not impossible, for them to
fall into errors concerning parts of
speech :
I.
Three little words yon often soo
Are articles, a, an, and the,
J I.
A noun's the name of anything.
As school or garden, hoop or swing.
III.
Adjectives show tho kind of noun.
As great, small, pretty, white or brown.
IV.
Instead of nouns the pronouns stand.
Her head, his face, your arm, my hand.
V.
Verbs tell us something to ho done,
To read, count, laugh, sing, jump or run
VI.
How things are done, the adverbs toll,
As slowly, quicklv, ill, or well.
VII.
Conjunctions join the words together,*
As men and women, wiud or weuther.
VIII.
The preposition stands before
A noun, us in, or through, the door.
IX.
The interjection shows surprise,
A h oil ! how pretty—ah ! how wiso.
X.
The whole are called 9 parts of speech,
Which reading, writing speaking teach.

Tho Loo Memorial Statue.
Mr. C. lîarbee and Mr. Roger
Cashing, the New York sculptors,
no giving the last finishing touch
es to the Leo Memorial Statrre, '
which is to be placed on tho grand
monument, that is now being exc»
eu ted at his tomb, at tho Washing
tun and Leo University, Lexington
Va. The figure represents General
Leo reposing in an easy posturo
upon a conch, his head and shoul
ders slightly raised above the body,
his left arm outstretched by the
side of his sword, his right hand
laid across his breast, and draped
in full Confederate uniform. The
appearance is natural and graceful,
indicating peaceful slumber rather
than death. This statue when fin
ished, will bo one of tho finest pie
ces of sculpture and will 1 >3 a last
ing honor to tho fame of Sir. Valen
tine, as it is a great credit to tho
gentlemen who aro doing tho work.
The block of marble from which tho
figure was chisseled was procured
from the quarries in Vermont, and
< one of the purest blocks ever
often out there. It is freo from
i!l black spots which is so abon
dant, in Italian marble. It weigh
ed thirteen tons when taken to tho
studio; and tho whole work only
weighs some six or seven toils now.
I lie gentlemen have made very
rapid progress on tho statue since
they commenced it on the first of
October last, and the finishing of if
shows the well trained chisel of^ho
irtists. The statue is to bo mount
d in the chapel at Lexington in
Line next, but wo trust tbo public
will have ample opportunity to in
spect its admirable proportions and
and artistic excellence before being
removed from the city.—[ Richmond
