In iB6O, all the candidates took the
stump, and the great Democratic Party
was talked into chaotic confusion. Lin
coln, the minority candidate, slipped into
the White House. If somebody could
have muzzled Yancey and Douglas and
Toombs, while the management of the
party was confided to a Council composed
of such men as Alexander H. Stephens,
Robert M. T. Hunter, ex-President Tyler,
and Judah P. Benjamin, a Democratic
President would have been elected and
there would have been no Civil War. The
slavery question would have been settled
without bloodshed, just as it was settled
in every other land where it existed.
An almost talked-to-death Irishman
once cried out, in his agony, “Oratory
is the curse of Ireland!”
It is certain that Oratory was our bane
in 1859 an d iB6O.
After the War, the most successful can
didates for the Presidency have been the
men who put forth their principles in
writing and kept off the stump.
Gen. Grant made no speeches, nor did
Tilden —and Tilden was just as certainly
elected as was Grant. Cleveland put forth
written statements, only, while Blaine, his
opponent, made brilliant oratory so com
mon that it ceased to dazzle. Harrison
made speeches,—and was, in his turn,
beaten by the silent Cleveland.
McKinley stood on his front veranda
and read a few well-chosen words to ex
cursion crowds that were hauled in on
the trains; while Bryan stormed the
American world with his oratory and
talked his chances away. Had he been
able to hold his chain long enough to
comprehend that his one hope was to
solidify the Populist vote and thus
carry doubtful states, he would have been
elected. But he talked so much that he
had no time for study, and thus he swap
ped fatuous ovations in the East for elec
toral votes in the West.
. In 1904 Roosevelt made no speeches,
while Parker did. Result: Parker had
to copy that telegram of congratulations
which Bryan sent to McKinley, and pass
it on to Theodore.
Doesn’t the review of the record show
that it is at least doubtful whether the
candidate gains votes by making
speeches?

had let it be known that he was going
to reverse himself on that matter of the

revolutionary methods to deprive the
small counties of their Constitutional
rights, wouldn’t he have been the worst

tive office—wouldn’t he have been jeered

As to Joe Brown, HE has no consum
ing ambition to go to the U. S. Senate,
nor to be named as Vice-President on
the national Democratic ticket; conse
quently, it would not interfere with any
of HIS selfish plans if the State of
Georgia should cast her electoral vote for
a native Georgian. Joe Brown, a native
Georgian, would probably not consider
the state disgraced by complimenting
Mr. Watson. Hoke Smith, ex-member
of Cleveland’s cabinet, not a native Geor
gian, would probably feel that he should
resort to every possible stratagem to hold
the state in her place as a political Rot
ten borough, —the pawn to be moved as
Tammany and Wall Street will it in the
great game of national politics.
Our friends throughout the state will
find much food for serious thought in this
suggestion.
Some of the Hoke Smith shouters
who are pretending to feel alarm for the
Disfranchisement amendment are really
making all that noise for the purpose of
keeping the people from looking at some
thing else, —towit, the new rule of the
Hoke Smith committee which deprives
minority counties of representation and
which takes away from the small coun
ties the share of power allotted to them
by our State Constitution.
In other words, the Hoke Smith Com
mittee has amended our Constitution to
suit themselves, and the people are asked
to ratify the outrage by electing Hoke
Smith again.
No wonder these tricksters raise a false
alarm over Prohibition and Disfranchise
ment !
The four big cities of this state were
given, by the Constitution of 1877, twice
as much political power as 26 next larg
est counties, and three times as much as
all the others.
The framers of the Constitution debat
ed the subject thoroughly, and this divis
ion of power was thought to be the best
that could be made.
So matters stood until we elected Hoke
Smith governor. Apparently he or his
advisers were not satisfied with our Con
stitution, and wanted to change it. Know
ing that the people of the country coun
ties would never vote to deprive them
selves of their Constitutional rights, these
city politicians slipped a new rule into the
Macon platform, and have thus revolu
tionized our system. Instead of having
twice as much power as the twenty-six
“next largest counties”, the big cities will
have ten or fifteen times as much. Instead
of having three times as much power as
the hundred and odd small country coun
ties, the big cities will have thirty times
as much.
Unless Hoke Smith has his Committee
to come together and undo what they
have done BEFORE THE JUNE ELEC
TION, the success of Smith in this race
will be taken to be a ratification of the
new rule in favor of the big cities.
Then “Goodbye” to country influence
in Georgia affairs!
