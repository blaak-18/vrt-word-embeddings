"''113E \WEEIIKLY blN has now attaiu
el a clrculattioIl of over seventy thou
;anrd copies. Its renlers are foundl ill
eve'ry State and Territory, and its quali
tv is well known to the public. We
shall not only endeavor to keep it fully
11p to the old standard, but to improve
and add to its variety and power.
THE WEEKLY SUN will continue to
be a thorough newspaper. All tire news
of the day will be found in it, condens
ed when uninportant, at full length
when of moment, and always, we trust,
treated in a clear, interesting and in
structive manner.
It is oar aim to make the Weekly Sun
the liest fanmily newspaper in the worldi.
It will be full ot entertaining and ap
Inopriate reading of every sort, but will
print nothing to offend the most scrupu
lous and delicate taste. It will always
contain the most interesting stories and
romances of the day, carefully selected
and legibly Urinted.
The Agricultural Department is a
prominent feature in the Weekly Sun,
and its articles will always be found
fresh and useful to the farmer.
The number .of men independent in
politics is increasing, and the Weekly
nu is their paper especially. It belongs
to no party, and obeys no dictation, con
tending for principle, and for the election
of the best men. It exposes the corru)p
tion that disgraces the country and
threatens the overthrow of republican
institutions. It has no Tear of knaves,
and seeks no favors from their support
era.
The markets of every kind and the
fashions are regularly reported in its
columns.
The price of the WEEKLY SUN is one
dollar a year for a sheet of eight pages,
and fifty-six columns. As this barely
pays expenses of paper and printing, we
are not able to make any discount or al
low any premium to friends who may
make special efforts to extend its circula
tion. Under the new law, which re
quires payment -of postage in advance,
one dollar a year, with twenty couts the
cost of prepaid postate added, is the rate
of subscription. It. is not necessary to
get up a club in order to have the Week
ly Sun at this rate. Any one who sends
one dollar and twenty cents will get the
paper, post-paid, for a year.
We have no traveling agents.
THE WEEKLY SUN.-Eight pages,
fifty-six columns. Only $1.20 a year,
postage prepaid. No discount from this
rule.
THE DAILY SUN.--A large four-page
newspaper of twenty.-eight columns
Daily circulation over 12U.000. All the

FOR 1875.
We take pleasure in announcing to the
numerous friends of the VINDICTOR,
that we have perfected arrangements for
the uontinuation of its publication upon
a fi!rm basis. The public are well aware
of the difficulties under which the Con
iervative press ot Loaisiana labor; the
infamous printing law passed by a parti
san Legislature, solely to foster and ul~
hold, at the expense of the tat-payes,
journals entirely artagonistqe to theiy
interest~ and at war npon tl hr lieliieos,
and by forcing, under the formns of law,
our citizens to advertise in these offlicial
papers, to break down their ptwer, the
Conservative and Democratic press; con
Requnently we are compelled to depend
for support upon the generous contribu
tion of a people already poverty-stricken,
but we feel assured that they will not
fail to sustain their main power in the
war of virtue against vice
The Fcarlru Whie lIm's PrFm of

The future tone of this paper can be
Judged from its past. We will continue
to advocate to success, the righfs of the
TAXED, that honesty and capability,
ALONE, shall constitute grounds for po
litical prefernient, and a continued and
never ceasing war upon Kellogg and his
corrupt otilcals--knowing themn, to be in
common with their Chief, both usmrpers
and thieves.
We can assure the public that we will
not hesitate toattack the ates of any po
litical organization, when we believe
thhemto be antagonistic to publio good.
We are the servant Oqfno.clique or party,

ISSUEDI) ONT1ILY.
"'A MagliECnlt Conception, wonderfully
carried out."
Thbn necessity of a popular ineilimn for
e the rlepre)1''ntatio;a of the productions of
our great artists, has always been recog
I nizedl, and many attempts have been
stnmle to meet the want. '!h s1ccessiVe
failures which so invaribly tollowed eecl
aI ttemtpt in this country to estahlish an
artjlrunal, did not prove the indiffer
Snce of the lpeople of Aimerica to the
claims of high art. So soon as a proper
Sappreeiation of the want andl an lility
to nmeet it were shown, thei public :t
once rallied with enthusiasm to its sup.
port. and the result was a great artistic
and commercial triumph-THE ALDINE.
S THE ALDINE, while issued with all the
i regularity. has none of the temporary or
1 timely interest characteristic of ordinary
periodienis. It is an elegant miscellan.; y
i ofpure, light and graceful literature; and
, a collection of pictures, the rarest Speci
1 unens of artistic skill, in black and white.
Although each succeeding number affords
ºa fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beauty of the At.aDIN will be
most appreciated after it has been bound
n up at the close of the year. While other
I journals may claim superior cheapness, as
Scompared with rivals of a similar class,
I the AtltxE is a unique and original con
I ception-alone and unapproached-ahbso
r lately without competition in price or
character. The possessor of a complete
volume cannot duplicate the quantity of
fine paper and engravings in any other
I shape or numler of volumes for ten timnes
its cost: and then, there is the Chlu mo
ºbesides!
National featurel of THE ALDINE
must be taken in no narrow sense. Trute
art is cosmopolitan. While TIIE AL
DINE is a strictly American institution,
it does not confino itself entirely to the
reproduction of native art. Its mission
is to cultivate a broad and .appreciative
art taste, one that will discriminate only
on grounds of intrinsic merit. Thus,
while placing before the paidiis io i'HE
º ALDINE, as i leading characteritic, the
productions of the most noted American
a artists, attention will ,always be given to I
specimens from. foreign nasters, giving
subscribers altl the pleasure aml instrue
tion obtainable from home or foreign
sonrces.
The nstistie illustration of American
Sscenery, original with THE ALDINE, is
an important feature, and its magnificent
plates are of a size naore tppropriate to
the satisfactory treatment of details
titan can be afforded by any inferior
page. 'The judicious interspersion of
landscape, marine, figure, and animal
subjects, sustain an unabated interest,
impossible where the Bcope of the work
confines the artist too closely to a single
style of subject. Th1'd literature of THE
ALDINE is a light amtd graceful accom
paniment, worthy of the artistic fea
tures, with only snel technical diiqisi
tions as do not interfdere with the popa
lar interest of the wotk.

The Saturday Evening Post.
The Oldest and Best Story Paper Pub.
lished.
Founded August 4, A. D. 1821.
For more than half a century the
Saturday. Evening Post has been the
GREAT IJTERARY WEEKLY
of the Country, andl has ever borne a
widespread aud unblemishld reputation
for the ausurpoeeed parity, refinement
and excellence of the Serials, 8ketbches
and Miscellaueous reading matter.
It is pre-eminently
The Best Family Paper
that is published in thiscountry, from its
never containing anything that would
offend the feelings of any one, either iln
i religions or political sensae, or that
could not be readat any fireeide without
objection from the most fastidious.
T'he dciroulation of the Saturday Even
ing Post, through not quite so large
perhap, as its younger contemporaries,
:a not, like that of some of then,, flueun
ating, and too often slhort-livod, but ...
SURE, SOLID AD SUBSTANTIAL,
based upon the intrinsio merit of the pa
per itself and not dependent on mny ex
traneous intfluences, such as the populari
ty of individual writers, &e.
Goodl, however, as the Saturday Even
ing Post has been in the past, it is our
intention to make it still better in the
future apd with this object in view we
will effect a marked improvement in eve
ry department of the paper, and will
call to our assistance writers of admitted
ability and known reputation.
By inereasing its former attractions,
and adding lany jnudicious and pleas
ing novelties; by studying how to please
aml cultivate the popular taste, by in
easinq. industry and enterprise, and by
elargedn facilities, we hope to make new
friends with each and every ieaue, and
eontinne to maintain the elaim of the
iaturday Evening Post to its title of Tin
