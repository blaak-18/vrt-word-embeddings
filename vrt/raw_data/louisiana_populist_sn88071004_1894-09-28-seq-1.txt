Mir. Kernocan: "There is gre:at
timidity on the part of the men in
this State, and I think the time
has come when they should muster
ulp their courage. I am a protee
tionist from all points of the com
pass. and consequently can not he
a )Democrat. I announce now that
I will in the future vote with the
Republicans in National politics."
Mir. Ilowells said: "lie had nev
er voted anything but the straight
lDemocratic ticket in his life, and
had never stoodx on a platform
which was a contradiction to the
political course he had plursued at
any time. He hadl been the one
thing only. He asked if the a:s
sembly believed in the doctrine of
protection. If they did the only
course for them to pursue as lin.,
was to live up to their convictions.
If they were all I)emocrats they
should say so, and if they would
vote the Republican ticket they
should say this also. He believed
in letting the dead past bury its
dead. The question was then as to
whether they would sacrifice their
homes and posessions for an empty
sentiment. )DO THEY SCARE
YOU WITH THE NEGRO.
THE NEGRO WILL NEVER
BE A DOMINATING POWER AS
IA)NG AS THERE IS A WHITE
MAN. Why should we preach
one way and think another? "I
say that if we believe the republi
can sentiment is right, let us say
so, and sirs, I announce right here
my intention of voting the Repub
lican ticket in all national matters
in future."
Mr. Albert Estopinal, said: "We
can not expect any thing at the
hands of a Democratic congress;
we have been robbed and ruined by
the Democrats, we must either be
Democrats or Republicans, and I
earnestly hope that the committee
on resolutions which is now at work
will report resolutions such as will
closely define a protectionist plat
form, and that must be a Republi
can platform."
Mr. E. N. Pugh, said: "I see
around me Democrats who have vo
ted the Democratic ticket from
time immemorial, but our interest
no longers lie in that direction.
Continuing in the same strain, Mr.
Pugh dwelt on the utter inutility
of sending to Washington a man
who would vote with the Republi
cas on protection only. Tobeof
any service in the House the repre
seatative of the sugar interests of
Louisiaas must be in sympathy
with the Republimns on other ques
tions, and identify himself with
them. Ascmnsion pariah had al
ready committed herself to this
view though it had cost herciti
ses a struggle to wrench them
selves away from the old Demo
cratic party of which they had been
so pmod, but they had now crossed
the BRubiavoa."
Mr. Horaee Wilkinsoma sid:
"Thqy had tried the Democrsh,

what they might expect from the
Democratie party, sad he for one,

All That People Can Expect of
the Administration is the Agi

El). P( PUITIST:
The admn inist rat ion o-called I )em
ocrats and a sultsidiezd press. Iy
sophistry,. misrepresentation and
the sulppression of facts are cndeav
oring to dcceive the p op'le in re
garl t tthe cau:e. and the extent of
the deplorable condition of affairs
that exi-t throiumhout thi:- once
prosi erous country. Fotrtunately.
the sinister designs of these par
ties are so latent that they have
ceased to exercise any influence up
on the mpulic mind. These jour
nals are read tby the nmajority of
pleople simply to gratify the natu
ral curiosity for news. Such :as
nmurders, cyclones, fltoodls and fires.
These plarties would have the thx',
ple Ielieve that overproduction,
credit system. lacIk of confitlence
and protection are the cause of their
woes, and that contraction ant pro
tection is the panacial. They sup
press evidence of election frauds.
They are silent in regard to the
fact that many of the officials to
whom the people should look for
legislation against the encroach
ment of trusts and combines are
stockholders, and the saleried em
ployees of the monoplxlies. They
regale the public with the assurance
that there is evident indications of
returning prosperity, the result
of their wise legislation. And in
evidence of this, cite the statistics
showing a decrease in mortgages,
and they aver that real estate is en
hancing in value. They suppress
the fact that ninety-nine of every
hundred of the mortgages are can
celled by foreclosure of the money
lender, and that nearly every can
celled mortgage represents one
more family of units to the rapidly
increasing army of homeless wand
erers, and they fail to call attention
to the fact that the enhancement of
values, is confined to the localities
that are favored with a bounty or
ample protection. They are vocife
rous in their feaity to himetalism.
But he warns the people of the
dangerous experiment of the un
limited coinage of silver at a ratio
of 16 to I, without the consent of
all other nations, an experiment
under which this nation prospered,
and that was only abandoned at the
behest and in the interest of the
shylocks.
Such admission is about as rea
sonable as to warn a man who had
sailed smoothly for years under the
flag of his country, that had been
cast in mid ocean, andt was strug
ling for existence, to be warned of
the dangerous experiment of trust
ing himself to being rescued on a
staunch hark bearing the flag of
his country, and to wait, and trust
to an international fleet coming to
his rescue.
They point to the passage of the
administration trust protecting tar
if bill, and the subsequent ruise of
the House towards tariff reform,
as an evidence of the administra
tions intention to carry out one of
their pledges to the people. Should
they do so.
Could any expectation be more
chimeracal than this would restore
prosperity. Could any" course be
more properously absurd and
auicide and than for a nation like
ours with resources ajmost unlimi
ted only parthlly developed, with
a rapidly increasing population
aad havy outstanding indebtednesm
and to submit to creditor nations
todictate her Inancial policyand
quietly abide the time, hoping that
the national shylocks might at
some time relent and eonsent to a
policy that would be less veni
"mou. This la the policy thead
ministration so-called Democrats
advise.. History gives no igstance
of any nation ever lprospering with
a steadily contracting currenc\v.
Tariff ref,,rlu is the shiblaleth of
the ad linistration. 1, this cry I
tiey hope to direct tihe l',le ie fronm
the more ital issues anil to retaini
the reins of goc,,rment-they will
fail. "'The hand 'writiung is on the
wall." the free antid unlimitedti
•oinage of gold and silvr at a ra
tio of l; to I auwl a free vote and
an hon;est count. areu the real and
vital issues. They are true I )mulo
eratic principles. They may cry
down. hut like the gltu.-t of Ilan
co. they will not down. and woe
to he that would trample them un
der; the politician that opposes
then is weaving his political
shroud.

El. PoI'UrisT.
D)ear Sir and lBro:-It has been
some time since I have seen anv
thing in your valuable paler from
this section. therefore I will give
or try to give you a few dots from
this part of this grand old creole
State.
Politics are beginning to get lively
again. We had a very good time
at Logansport on the 1th our can
didate for ('ongress, the lion. B.
W. Bailey who was billed to speak
there was on hand anti also was the
lion. H. W. Ogden present, and
the citizens enjoyed themiselves
listening to the speakers. It see:ns
that there is being more interest
manifested in this campaign than
has been for some time andt I think
the I)Democrats have got to bring
in some good proof that they have
been doing all they could for the
good of the people or else they
will evidently he snowed under
this time, for the people are begin
ning to realize that giving them a
chance will never do to make a
living on.
Mr. Ogden tells us to come back
to the Democratic party that they
have been doing all they could to
help the masses, that they never
did vote for any of the vicious
laws, but we know that if they did
not vote for them, they never vo
ted at all. Hle says that they have
give us an income tax and they
have done this and the other for
the people. We will give them
credit for the income tax, but I
know as every other man that
reads, that had it not been for the
five Populists Senators, we would
never have had any thing like the
income tax.
The people is being robbed just
the same and the Democratic party
is just as reslpnsible as is the Re
publican party and we will never
have any reform legislation
through either of the okl parties.
For this reason, both of the okl
parties represent a very large ma
jority of the capital, and it is an
evident fact that capital is organ
ized against labor and there is but
one way in which to dethrone an
organized enemy, and that is by
a united force and I am glad to say,
that there is now an orgamnzation
on foot alnd that its doors are open to
every white citizen that is in favor
of reform legislation. If the peo
ple will join in this grand fraterni
ty it will be instrumental in
gaining for them what they have
lost through corrupt legislation,
their equal, legal and political
rig-hts. The name of this order is so
grand that no honest American can
refuse to ailiate, it being tli or
ganiution by which our forefathers
founded this once noble country
for which they fought, bled and
died, but through this organization
the ancient order of loyal Ameri
an decreed that these United
States were free and independent.
We are organizing in I)eSoto
very rapidly, and I hope that every
Io~her pal,-h is dIin, the satne. I I
will go to-Inorrm\v to a.-.ii in or

which theN are now tryingto carry.
If the ip'oljde will read and think,
they will undoubltlly act for them- I

NUMBER XIV.
All important, egotistical, bull
headed coarse grained, bovine
necked, big bellied Grover, our
most excellent majesty and tub of
fat who reigneth in Washington.
Thou art still master of the situa
tion by a large anti rapidly increas
ing majority. When thou puttest
thy foot down the earth trembles,
and the I)emocrats thereon. The
higness of thy mightness is past
finding out. If there is anything
that thou canst not do, there is no
one yet born who is able to guess
what it is. Thou~canst spank con
gress with one hand, hug Maria
Halpin with the other. And the
people-thy people-say, amen!
Even congress seems to enjoy it,
for Breckinridge and divers others
go out and hunt them up a Maria
of their own. That congress, most
gracious master, is a honey. It is
a whole dlad-gummed lot of honies.
It is a congress after thine own
heart. It doeth thy hidding like
a tender child with sore eyes and a
hungry stomach. It is not proud
and stubborn like ('oxey and
Brownie. But, most worthy mas
ter, didn't you sock it to them n
DIidn't you make 'em sweat? So
shalt thou do to all who commit the
greatest crime ever committed in
thy holy city-walking on the
grass. But, oh, our most beloved
political master, that last thing
which thou didst do taketh the cake
and nearly all the cold pie that
lieth loose upon the dump. Demo
crates, or men who call themselves
Democrats, have howled and yelp
ed about states' rights and local
self government. For this princi
ple they fought and got most glori
ously thrashed. But they came
up out of the wreck of defeat still
howling states' rights. They
claimed that the war settled noth
ing except that the Yankees were
more mumerous than the Johnnies
and they suecmbned to the more
force of numbers. But they hug
ged close to their poltieal bosoms
the'doctrine of States' rights and
local self government, as one of
the fundamental doctrines of time
honored Democracy. What did
you do, most worshipful political
master t You knocked that doe
