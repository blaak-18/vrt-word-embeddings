Gross of Min\nneapolis, grand dragon and King\nKleagle of the Klan in Minnesota, as\nthe begining of a movement to organ\nize Klans in every county of the state.\nColumns of Klansmen came in late\ntoday from Minneapolis, St. Paul,\nan Ideal Place Near Austin was\nFairmont, Preston, Rushford, Roches\nter, Red Wing, Cannon Falls, Zum\nbrota, Faribault, Pipestone, Owaton\nna, Mankato, Spring Lake, Canby,\nMontevideo, St. James and other\ntowns scattered over the state. Many\nKlansmen, without robes, mingled\nwith the crowd that massed on one\nside of the ampitheater to watch the\nspectacle tonight.\nGhostly figures in white from peak\ned cap to the dragging hems of flow\ning gowns patrolled the roads about\nAustin tonight in the role of traffic\npolice.\nThousands View Night Scene\nThe ceremonies started with thou\nsands of spectators banked on one\nhillside while the Klansmen in their\nwhite robes were ranged on the other.\nThe two masses were separated bj\nthe creek which cuts through the lit\ntle valley.\nPeter J. Orn, St. Paul, editor of the\n“Call of the North,” the Minnesota\nKlan publication, first delivered an\naddress on Klan policies. At the\nconclusion of this address the great\ncrowd of spectators, visible in the\nsemidarkness only in the glow of red\nfire, were startled by the sudden il\nlumination of the sky by three 10,000\ncandlepower bombs, throwing a white\nlight over the entire scene.\nAs the light was fading, massed\nhundreds, Klansmen came over the\nhill, their ghostly white robes relieved\nby the flaming red cross on 'their\nbreasts. Slowly they advanced on\nthe platform, where Kleagle Gross\nand the state ritual team stood re\nsplendent in silken robes of white\npurple and burnt orange.\nAs the Klansmen reached the foot\nof the incline and stood before the\nplatform, red fire was lighted in all\nparts of the grounds, throwing a\nfiery glow over the scene. A band\nplayed the “Star Spangled Banner,”\nwhile the Klansmen stood rigidly at\nattention^\nAt the conclusion of the anthem\nritualistic fireworks called “Princesses\nFeathers” were shot off, covering the\nsky in a fan shaped figure. As this\nspectacle faded, three more white\nlight bombs were set off, and with\nthis as the signal 400 or more men\nappeared through a lane of Klans\nmen.\nThey were the candidates. Then\nfollowed the ceremonial. The three\noaths required of candidates were\ngiven by the Klokard, the Klaliff, and\nthe Kludd. These oaths pledge al\nlegiance to the Klan. As the cere\nmonial concluded, the candidates\nknelt on the right knee and the band\nplayed “Nearer My God to Thee,” the\nthree great crosses wrapped in oil\nsoaked gunny sacks were then light\ned, throwing a blue and white light\nthat could be seen for miles. Dr. W.\nS. Harper, Minneapolis, national lec\nturer, closed the ceremony with pray\ner.\n20,000 Spectators Allowed Near\nScene Where Three Crosses\nBurned."
