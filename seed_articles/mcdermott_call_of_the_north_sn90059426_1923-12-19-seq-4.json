Patrick McDermott,\nthe Roman Catholic undertaker who\nparticipated in an attack on the Ku\nKlux Klan while that organization was,\nparading the streets of Carnegie the\nnight of August 25, has again been\narrested upon a charge of murder in\nconnection with the killing of Thomas\nR. Abbott, Klansman, who fell a vic\ntim to the murderous mob.'\nMcDermott was released after an\ninvestigation by a coroner’s jury im\nmediately following the events which\nled up to the murder. The action of\nthe officials in the matter was the\nsubject of much condemnation by the\nlaw-abiding citizens of the common\nwealth at the time. Following a- hear\ning last Friday before Justice of the\nPeace, W. H. Prosses, of Carnegie,\nMcDermott was arrested and held\nwithout bail on a murder charge.\nTwo witnesses at the hearing iden\ntified McDermott as the man who\nfired the shot that killed Abbott. The\nprosecution against McDermott was\ninstituted by the widow of the dead\nKlansman."
