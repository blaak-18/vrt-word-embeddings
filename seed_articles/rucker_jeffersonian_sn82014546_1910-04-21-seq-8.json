Almost\nevery business man in the State of\nGeorgia is thrown in contact, in some\nway, with the Collector of the Inter\nnal Revenue, and it is a shame that\nthis negro has been retained in office.\nEven though this negro may have\nmade a good officer, yet it w r ould have\nbeen possible to oust him if he had\nno backing, but it has simply been\nimpossible to do anything on account\nof the support the negro has had\nback of him. Here are the facts, and\nthe people can draw their own con\nclusions.\nDuring William McKinley’s second\nterm, the writer was an applicant for\nappointment to succeed this negro,\nRucker. I had the support of Senator\nClay, Congressmen Livingston, Adam\nson and Griggs, and I know these\ngentlemen did everything in their\npower to get that negro out. I wrote\nCongressman Howard that if he\nwould give me his support I would\nsee that his father-in-law, Dr. King,\nwas retained and had a good job.\nCONGRESSMAN HOWARD RE\nPLIED TO ME THAT “A BIRD IN\nHAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE\nBUSH, AND AVE ARE GOING TO\nIET IT STAND AS IT IS.”\nThe people of Georgia have al\nways condemned the Republicans for\nplacing negroes in office, but 1 think\none of our number who will howl\nagainst the appointment of negroes,\nand then secretly hold these negroes\nin office, is numbered among that\nclass of whom the Savior said, “How\nshall ye escape the damnation of\nhell,” and of whom I say, how shall\nthey escape the condemnation of the\npeople?\nThe people of Georgia have been\nforced to bow to this negro Rucker\nall these years for no other reason\nthan just simply to furnish a job to\none of his white clerks.\nYours truly,\nAtlanta, Ga. J. K- McCALL."
