    "text": "D. McIntosh -The Half-Breed.\nThis individual in his testimony be\nfore the Congressional Committee, in\nNew Orleans, declared that he \"heard\nof a plot to assassinate Mr. Stockton,\nat Natchitoeches\"-when f why ? and\nby whom t This is what this gallant\nLieutenant of the United States army,\nfails to diselose-he does not give his\nauthority-perphaps the a n rc e\nwhence it camte was of such a ques\ntionable and disreputable character,\nthat he was ashamed to give it.\nFrom the company lie kept about\nhim whilst in our midst, he could\nhave heard almost anything that\ntended to blacken the chbaracter and\nreputation of our peaceable commu\nnity. Who is Lieutenant D. Mcln\ntosh ? From his own declaration, we\nunderstand that he is an officer in the\nFederal army. From hearsay, we\nlearn that he is a half-breed Indian ;\nthe olfspring of free-lovelsm-From\nhis personal appearance we would put\nhim down as a thorough bred Indi\nan. Rumor has also circulated the\nfact that lie is the unfortunate vic\ntim of fear, on the field of battle;\nand in camps, the boon companion of\nsuch low-flung fellows as Stockton,\nHenry Boullt and others of that ilk\nIs it really so t We heard so.\nOur people have always had a high\nrespect for the Federal uniform when\nit covers a high-toned gentleman and\na noble heart. With us, a United\nStates officer is prima facie a man of\neducation, good breeding, genial man\nners and civility, unless he proves\nhimself otherwise; a person who\nperforms dispassionately, and with\npropriety, his duties as an offlicer, and\nnot as a partisan-The gallant Lien\ntenant's conduct, whilst here, has\nbeen anything else but thatkhe was\ninhuman and brutal towards the\nprisoners under his charge; pre-judg\ning their case, and taking it fora grant\nel that they were guilty of the ac\ncnsations brought against them, there\nby over-stepping his dqty assigned\nhim, of assisting the Marshal in ma.\nking arrests, and gwrding the aceused\nwhen arrested. He showed somewhat\nof thie native cruelty and savageness\nof his race towards the pale-faced.\nHis animosity against the people of\nNatobitohes, arose probably from\nhis knowledge of the entire annihila\nties by our ancestors of an Indisn\ntribe, the Natchez, within a couple of\nmiles of this place. Must we be held\nresponsible for that Why is it that\nLient. Wallace of his company, was\nnot called upon to substantiate his\nstatement? Because his evidence\nwould have been quite the reverse.\nHe was taken in and respected by our\ncitizeas, becaase he carried his uni\nfoam with becomingness and decency,\nand proved himself worthy of the\nrespeet and regard always paid a gen\ntleman-We A.ow that.\nIf our people delighted in assassian\nation they would never imbue their\nhands in the blood of such cattle as\nStockton, the whilom U. 8. Marshal.\nThey would reek their vengeance on\nmore dangerous headsa-When Boullt,\nMyers, Pierson, Blunt & Co., still\nlive, why, oh I why should Stockton\ndiea"
