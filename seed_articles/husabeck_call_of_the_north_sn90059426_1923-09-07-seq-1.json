A burning\ncross was torn down , robes were\nstripped from Klansmen and the dis\nrobed men were driven from a field\nunder a barrage of shots and stones.\nThe two seriously injured are:\nHarry Husabeck, 17, Newcastle, shot\nthrough the abdomen, and William\nClark, 31, Newport, shot through the\nneck.\nFifty more were hurt by the rain\nof stones and'stray shots.\n* The riot began whew the Klansmen\nlighted their crosses. With shouts\nof “Down with the Klan,” and “Hur\nrah for the Irish,” a mob of 1,000\nmostly young men, accompanied by\nabout 106 Negroes, charged the Klan.\nThe first shot is thought to have\nbeen fired by the mob when they\nheard a Klansman firing blanks as\nthe cross burst into flames.\nLAWLESS CROWD STORMS KLAN\nMob Faces Tear Gas* Night Sticks and Fire Hose in\nAssault on Perth Amboy Hall\nPerth Amboy, N. J., Aug. 30.—A\ncrowd of 5,000 persons broke up a\nmeeting of the Ku Klux Klan in Odd\nFellows’ hall tonight, 75 policemen\nand 150 firemen being unable to drive\nback the throng that stormed the\nbuilding. The mob was so completely\nforeign that odors of garlic and stale\nfish filled the air for blacks in the\n■vicininty of the lawless, anti-Klan\nheathens.\nFiremen drove trucks into the mass\nof people, but of no avail.\nA hurry call was sent for State\npolice in Trenton.\nPatrolmen fired shots in the air,\nthrew gas bombs and swung their\nnight sticks, while the firemen turned\nstreams of water on the fighting\nthrong.\nThe leaders of the mob were\nknocked down by patrolmen when\nthey first started to advance toward\nthe hall, but after they had been car\nried away another attack was started.\nThis time stones were thrown and all\nwindows in the Odd Fellows’ hall, as\nwell as many others in nearby build\nings were broken.\nHurl Tear Bombs in Vain\nPolice Chief Tonneson then ordered\nhis men to throw tear gas bombs,\nand 13 of these, the town’s entire\nsupply, was exploded. The crowd fell\nback, but advanced again, hurling\nmore stones. It was then that a riot\ncall was sonnd and 150 firemen dash\ned to the scene.\nAfter the firemen had run their ap\nparatus directly at the surging mass\nof humanity and had failed to dis\nperse the crowd they attached base\nlines to every available hydrant and\ndrenched the rioters with several\nstreams of water. Daunted for a\nfew seconds the crowd fell back. Sev\neral of the more sturdy, however,\nbraved the water and cut the base\nlines with axes and knives while\nthose ini the crowd threw stones at\nthe firemen.\nKlansmen Assailed\nChief Tonneson, in the meantime,\nhad ordered the Klasmen to leave the\nbuilding. Clambering out of win\ndows, down fire escapes and through\nevery available exit, they were met\nby their assailants and many hand\nto-hand fights ensued.\nAs one man darted from the crowd\nsome one shouted, “That man has a\ngun.” To save the Klansmen a\npatrolman grabbed him, shoved him\ninto an automobile and rushed him\nto the police station. Other cars\nloaded with mobbers followed, but\nthe Klansman was rushed through\nthe and hid him in a stable at the\nrear. After searching the station,\nthose who had followed returned to\nthe scene of the fight.\nAs some of the Klansmen broke\naway from *the fighting mass they\nshouted, “We’re coming back—lo,ooo\nstrong.” “All right,” came the ans\nwer, “we’ll be waiting for you.”\nMeeting Widely Advertised\nThe Klan meeting had been widely\nadvertised, notices having been post\ned in Perth Amboy and vicinity for\nthe past few days that it would be\nheld. Chief Tonneson took some pre\ncaution against possible trouhle as\nthe result of a somewhat lesser dis\nturbance that occurred at a Klan\nmeeting several months ago. He\nstationed uniformed patrolmen and\nplain clothesmen on the inside of the\nball ad at several other points in the\nvicinity.\nThe Klansmen gathered soon after\n8 o’clock, donned their robes and be\ngan their ceremonies. Soon little\ngroups began to form in front of the\nbuilding, the number being augment\ned until it was estimated that at\nleast 5„000 persons were in the\ncrowd. Men in the front ranks de\nmanded admittance to hall and when\nthey were refused, the fight began.\nChief Tonneson declared, after\nquiet had been restored, that he knew\nthe investigators of the mob action\nand promised the arrest of prominent\nlocal men.\nPerth Amboy, N. J. f August 31.\nButtling between the Ku Klux Klans\nmen and mobs was resumed on the\nstreets of Perth Amboy this morning\nas members of the order tried to es\ncape from Odd Fellows' hall, where\nthey had sought refuge during an at-\n$2.00 A YEAR. 5c A COPY\ntack on a Klan meeting Thursday\nnight, in which more than 100 per\nsons are reported to have been in\njured.\nA hundred men, armed with clubs\nand stones, attacked thirty Klansmen\nwho dashed from the hall this morn\ning.\nThe Klansmen were beaten severe\nly before they escaped their pursuers.\nPerth Amboy resembled a com\nmunity under martial law today as\nthe town's entire police force, large\ndetachment of state policemen and\n150 firemen, doing duty as special of\nficers patrolled the streets to quell\nany possible renewal oc clashes be\ntween members of the Ku Klux Klan\nand the mob which throughout the\nnight held the city in a grip of riot.\nNumber of Injured Unknown\nIt was impossible early today to as\ncertain the number of persons on\nboth sides who had been injured in\nthe night’s fighting. Every physician\nin the city had'treated one or more\ncases, while a considerable number of\ninjured had been attended to in hos\npitals.\nBattling started shortly before\nmidnight when a crowd estimated at\nmore than 5,000 men broke up a wide\nly advertised Klan meeting. The en\ntire police force of seventy-five, with\ndrawn guns and clubs, and reinforced\nby the entire fire department, made a\ndesperate effort to protect the 500\nKlansmen whose meeting had baa*\nsurrounded by the clamoring mob.\nMob Engulfs Victims\nKlansmen withstood the onslaught\nuntil greatly outnumbered, when\nmany of them fought their way to\ndoors, windows and fire escapes, only\nto be engulfed in the crowds below.\nThose who had not had the foresight\nto remove their Klan regalia were\ndistinguishable easily and received\nrough treatment before they escaped\nto the woods bordering the city.\nPolice Chief Tonneson had sum\nmoned a detachment of state troop\ners, whose arrival was greeted by re\nnewed .activities of the muttering\nmob. Aided by the state troopers,\nthe police began the removal of the\nimprisoned Klansmen. Several of\nthem were loaded into three automo\nbiles, which the crowd immediately\noverturned, administering sever#\nbeatings to the occupants. A patrol\n1 agon load of rescued received simi\nlar treatment. The crowd intercept\ned a number of escaping Klansmen\nwho were being led to safety ovar\nadjoining roofs. They also war#\nbeatep."
