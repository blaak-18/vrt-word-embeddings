S. troops in charge of\nU. S. Deputy Marshal,4itockton, and\nan indiscriminate arrest of the citi\nzens began.\nMajor Ahney and twelve other pro.\nminent citizens were taken in custody\nand lodged in the court-house in\ncharge of the Infantry troops station\ned there.\nStockton, the Marshal, refused to\nshow any authority for the arrests\nand they were made twithout warrants.\nNo one knows of the charges upon\nwhich the arrests were based, as the\nofficials were also reticent upon that\npoint.\nThus the work of intiaidation goes\nbravely on, while at one end of the\nline we are asked to disband the\nWhite Leagues, at the other, we are\nvigorously attacked by the Federal\nautho ities in charge of U. S. Marshal\nPackard, President of the Central\nCommittee of the Kelloggites.\nGet up another compromise Com\nmittee, and we suppose hand-euffs\nwill be used. Who says Geni. Emory's\ntroops are not used for political pur\nposes I\nWhite men of Natchitoches, to-day\ncloses the registration of voters, and\nnow our duty at the.ballot box is to\nbe done. We wish to keep green in\nyour minds the remembrance of your\nwrongs, the memory of the outrages\nperpetrated upon you and yours by\nthe power of such creatures as Myers,\nBonilt and Blunt. The taxes piled\nupon farms, your sustenance wasted,\nsnd the very efforts of your industry\nthwarted; and to impress upon you\nthat unless you desire s centinuation\nof these outrages, you must each and\nevery one repair to the polls and cast\nyour vote for the PEOPLE'S ticket.\nOur lines are formed-our banners\nunfurled-Onward, the enemy is be\nfore us."
