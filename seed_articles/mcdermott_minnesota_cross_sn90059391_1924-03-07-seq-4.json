    "text": "PITTSBURGH, PA., March 1.-The\ncases of the 12 men charged in dif\nferent instances with rioting and in\nciting riot, in connection with the\nfatal assault upon parading Klans\nmen at Carnegie, Pa., August 26,\n1923, will be placed before the Alle\ngheny county grand jury here next\nFriday, March 7. Included in the\nlot are, John Conley, Burgess of\nCarnegie; Ira (alias Ike) Irving,\nCarnegie constable, and Patrick Mc-\nDermott, Carnegie undertaker.\nMcDermott was indicted by the\nAllegheny county grand jury for mur\nder and involuntary manslaughter\nTuesday, February IS, in connection\nwith the death of Klansman Thos. R.\nAbbott, of Atlasburg, Pa., who was\nshot in the right temple that fatal\nSaturday night at Carnegie.\nMay Indict Men\nThe cases of the 12 men were to\nhave been held by the grand jury\nThursday, February 21, but were\npostponed. At that time, postpone\nment was decided upon until the\ncoming Friday, March 7, at which\ntime it is believed sufficient testi\nmony will be introduced by scores\nof subpoaened witnesses to indict\nthe men.\nIt has been reported from author\native sources that considerable influ\nence has been brought to bear upon\nthe members of the grand jury by\nclergymen and laymen in the Roman\nCatholic di&cese. At the time Mc-\nDermott was indicted. 13 jurors vot\ned to hold him for court trial. Six\nRoman Catholics were on the jury,\nandÂ» all voted against indictment, it\nis reported.\nTwo huge and successful public de\nmonstrations were staged in the\nPittsburgh district last week-end, by\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan from\nwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio,\nand northern West Virginia.\nThe first was at Coraopolis, Satur\nday night, February 23. A long and\ncolorful procession formed by both\nrobed Klansmen and Klanswomen,\naugmented by picturesque floats,\ntraversed the principal streets of\nthat community through long lanes\nof spectators. Despite the fact that\nfrigid weather kept thousands away,\nit was conservatively estimated by\nprominent Coraopolis Klansmen, that\nthe mid-winter demonstration was\none of the most successful of its\nkind ever held in western Pennsyl\nvania. A class of candidates was ini\ntiated into the order by members of\nthe Wilkinsburg, Pa., degree team.\nThey made the trip from Coraopolis\nto Wilkinsburg in a chartered street\ncar."
