    "text": "Organs of Radicalism.\nThe Radical press of Louisiana has\n.one virtue at least, if it can be so\nclassed, :and that is, it follows out\nthe. oldap trite maxim, that a good\nlie tcel stuck too, amounts to some\nthing like.the trath-to those who tell\nit.\nWe are reminded of this in noting\nthe tenacity with which these \"theives\nown,\" cling to the \"bloody shirt\" and\n\"outragelie\" business; and know that\nthere seems to exist no further occa\nsion to repeat the prevarications of\nthe \"Buareau of Justice\" at Washing\nton, and that the whole Northern\npress, both Republican and Deuocrat\nic, only refer to such statements as\n\"downright lies;\" it seems ludicrous,\nand the farce should end after such a\n\"set down\" as these people were the\nrecipienits of on the 3d of last No\nvember. We are sure they will pro\nduce but one effect, and that disgust,\nby flaunting their worn-outfalsehoods\nin the face of the American citizens\nwho have so overwhelmingly con\ndamned them.\nWhat can a decent people think of\na wretch, who would blazou to the\nlight of 'day an applogy for such\nfiends jas Merrill, Hodgeon, Seeyle,\nDeRlulio and- we were going to\nsay McIntosh qnd Stockton, but their\ncraven cowardice amplly m a k e s\namemnds for other qualities which are\nlacking in them.\nThis the Radical press, wo are\npaid by their mighty, friends in rma\ncajity Kellogg and Packard, does,\nand with that fawning and grinning\ngrace that distinguishes a lick dog\nfrom a man.. As a corps of liars and\nthieves; as defenders of eut throats\nand villains, the Jiadical Press of\nLoalsiase would. take the premium\neven over, the \"Odial Jeounai of\nhis Santatrpo \"ajesty in hell, where\nall these fawning, cringing, hounds\nwill be put to work, when earth Is'o\nlonger cumbered with such disgraces\nto hutnanity."
