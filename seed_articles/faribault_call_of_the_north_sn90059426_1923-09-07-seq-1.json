CEREMONIALS\nKLANSMEN COME FROM FAR AND WIDE BUT BAD ROADS\nKEPT MANY AWAY.\nWe knew it would rain after one\npeep at the clouds that hung low\nlast Friday. But we hoped it wouldn’t\nand so sang “Rain, rain, go away.\nCome again some other day.” Never\ntheless it rained—and rained —and\nrained. Over the state thousands of\n•Klansmen were debating whether or\nnot to start for Albert Lea. Many\nmust have felt like the poet who\nsang:\n“The rain, the desolte rain!\nCeaseless and solemn and chill!\nHow it drips on the misty pane,\nHow it drenches the darkened sill!\nO scene of sorrow and dearth\nI would that the wind awaking\nTo a firece and gusty birth\nMight vary this dull refrain\nOf the rain, the deslote rain.”\nWe decided to go in spite of dark\nclouds and spasmodic downpours. We\nclimbed into a waiting automobile and\nturned the gasoline wagon towards\nsouthern Minnesota. At a merry clip\nwe traveled until we passed out of\nFaribault, where we struck soft-sur\nfaced roads. At Owatonna we made\nsome unkind statements concerning\nthe road. A man was hearing us\nspeak about the road in terms that\nwere anything but flattery called our\nattention to an item in the editorial\ncolumn of the Owatonna Journal-\nChronicle that hit us as painfully\ntrue.\nDrunk Highway No. 1\nThe editorial read in part as fol\nlows:\n“After staggering over the road\nbetween this city and Faribault in\nhis motor car last week and jarring\nthru the maze of pitch holes one\ntourist said, ‘They ought to call it\nDrunk Highway No. 1, it’s jagged\nenough.’\n“And it is—we’ve tried it ourselves.\nThe present condition of the main\nhighway leading into Owatonna from\nthe north is nothing less than a dis\ngrace.” Nobody should boost about\nthe highway between Owatonna and\nAlbert Lea either. We managed to\nget into Albert Lea alive even though\nthe road threatened death with every\nturn the wheels of our car made.\nThe beautiful and friendly city of\nSouthern Minnesota, a Klan mecca\nfor a day, was one hustle and bustle\nwhen we slammed into a curb.\nWe were hungry and looked around\nfor some place to eat with a satis\nfactory atmosphere. At the “eatery”\nwe found many - Klansmen from St.\nPaul and Minneapolis. We had just\nswallowed the last hunk of a mighty\ngood steak when in walked a gang\nall wearing buttons on their coat lap\nels that measured four inches in diam\neter. On the buttons were three\nlarge black K’s, with an explanation\naround the circumference that re\nvealed the Klansmen as members of\nNorth Star No. 2, Minneapolis,\nMinn. Tell the world, we were glad\nto see them.\nKlansmen Assemble at County Fab*\nGrounds.\nAround seven o’clock Klansmen be\ngan to assemble at the county fair\ngrounds. The rail drizzled and pour\ned and drizzled and poured, but still\nAmericans kept coming.\nOfficials of the Ku Klux Klan de\nbated whether or not to go ahead with\nthe plans as laid out during the\nweek. All Klansmen agreed that a\nlittle moisture wouldn’t hurt anyt\nbody, so the orders for action were\nsent forth. The grandstand filled\nrapidly to the surprise of many.\nNearly three thousand people were\nseated waiting for “things to start”\nwhen the King Kleagle for Minne\nsota stepped forward and signalled\nto the band. At once the leader of\nthe musicians took his place and\nmost splendidly the Hayward band\nplayed a number of selections. Then\nDr. Harper, national Klan lecturer,\noffered prayer. The audience now\narose and lustily sang the first verse\nof “America.” “Twilight” Orn, edi\ntor of the Call of the North, was in\ntroduced as the speaker of the eve\nning.\nKlan Lecturer Well Received\nFor more than an hour the Klans\nman orator held his audience nearly\nspell-bound. The speaker was cheer\ned at frequent intervals, urging him\non’and on. In a masterly way he\noutlined the principles of the Klan\nsum! urged * keener interest in the\nKflsffir* of the nation . Mr Om defied\nTHE CALL °/ vhe NORTH\nanyone to prove that the Ku Klux\nKlan is not a sound American move\nment, seeking only that which ia\ngood for the United States. When\nthe Klansman ended his address a\nwild tumult of applause burst forth.\nThe cheering had hardly ceased\nwhen white—robed figures were seen\nmoving rapidly in the open area in\nfront of the grandstand. As they\nmoved red-glow candles sent out\ncrimson rays of light. There was\nheard a sharp command —two robed\nhorses on which were mounted\nKlansmen in full regalia, appeared.\nThe band played “Onward, Christian\nSoldiers” as white-clad figures\nfigures marching two abreast filed\nbefore the assemblage to the rear of\nthe altar-platform which had pre\nviously been arranged. Another or\nder was given, the Klansmen turned\nfacing the grandstand. Several white\nfigures mounted the altar-platform\nand stood at attention. The altar\ncross was now ignited. Three\nground-shaking explosions came one\nafter the other. Every Klansman in\nrobe saluted the flag with the firing\nof the\nscene and most impressive—the\nwhite-robed figures, the red-lit sky,\nthe fiery cross, the flag draped altar,\nunfurled Old Glory waving in the\nbreeze.\nIt rained incessantly, but the\nKlansmen didn’t seem to mind or\neven notice that they were getting\nwet.\nOnly Two Candidates Asked to Stand\nAn announcement was made to the\neffect that only two of the candidates\nfor initiation would be asked to stand\nin the rain fluring the ceremony of\nnaturalization.\nThere was a lull lasting only a few\nminutes.\nJust as the two selected candi\ndates came into view around the\ngrandstand a stentorian voice start\ned repeating a part of the Ku Klux\nKlan ritual. “God, give us men,” was\nthe prayerful appeal made most dra\nmatically. The ceremony moved on\nwithout a “hitch” of any kind. When\nthe third section of the Klan oath\nwas reached, the Klansman adminis\ntering the oath called for all citizens\nof the Invisible Empire within the\nreach of his voice to again pledge\nhis loyalty to God, country and flag.\nThere was an immediate movement\nof arms and every Klansman stood\nwith his left hand over his heart\nand his right arm raised toward\nheaven .In unison the Klansmen\nagain took the following oath:\ntiea I swear that I will most\ni Izealouslj—and valiantly—shield\nand preserve—by any and all—\njustifiable means and methods—\nthe sacred constitutional rights\n—and privileges of—free public\nschools—free speech—free press\n—separation of church and state\n—liberty—white supremacy—just\nlaws—and the pursuit of happi\nness—against any encroachment\n—of any nature—by any person\nor persons—political party or\nparties—religious sect or people\nnative, naturalized or foreign—\nof any race—color—creed—lin\neage or tongue whatsoever.\nAll to which I have sworn by\nTHIS oath—l will seal with my\nblood—be Thou my witness—Al\nmighty God—\nAMEN!\nBaptismal Ceremony Given in Full\nThe beautiful Klan baptismal cer\nemony followed.

Rockets\nflashed across the sky. Bombs burst\nin the air. A spectacular scene un\nlike anything ever seen in Minnesota\nwas presented. The white-clad Klans\nmen knelt in prayer. A voice of\ndeepest devotion lifted a plea unto\nthe Grand Architect of the Universe.\nCan you see the picture that is at\nonce one of awe inspiring grandeur\nand thrilling beyond words? Well,\nsuch a picture was painted on the\nmind-canvas of every person who\nsaw the open-air Klan ceremony at\nAlbert Lea last Friday night.\nAfter the conclusion of the natu\nralization ceremony the robed Klans\nmen went to their automobiles, and\ndrove into the down-town section of\nAlbert Lea and there organized the\nfirst Klan parade in Minnesota. It is a\nsignificant fact that two protestant\nwomen led the parade. As the\nKlansman marched they sang “On\nward, Christian Soldiers.” From the\nsidewalks and closely parked cars\ncame not a single word or contempt\nor antagonism. No efforts of any\nkind were made to cause the least\npossible trouble. The whole affair\nwas peaceful and orderly and of\ntaever-to-be-forgotten impressiveness.\n, The Letter\nAlbert Lea, Minnesota, Sept 2. 1923\nKu Klux Klan:\nWe had two small children with us when we attended the demon 7 -\nnstration and speech at the fair* grounds, and so, did not hear everything.\nAre women taken into the Klan? v\nlam just the busy mother of a growing family. I perhaps would not\nbe able to help much. But the wonder and happiness of beholding a group\nof men binding themselves together for the protection of our homes, the\nbetterment of our schools, and for the high ideals set forth by the speaker,\nwere such that I’ll have a higher opinion of the male sex hereafter. In\nthe words of the song, \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of\nthe Lord\" in that gathering last night. After all, mankind is not all un\nworthy when such ideals are carried on.\nIf women cannot enter the Klan, or if you have any doubt of any mo\ntive in writing, you may, of course ignore this letter. But, if possible, I’d\nlike to know more of this organization whose ideals will alone save our\ncountry from utter ruin, and what is closer yet to a mother’s heart, make\nthe world a better place for our children.\nWe are poor, I could not give much, but perhaps, some way I could\nhelp.\nAN ALBERT LEA MOTHER.\n' \\\nThe Open Answer\nDear Albert Lea Mother:\nYour delightful letter came to my attention a few minutes ago. What\nKlansman wouldn’t be thrilled by such a message—a message of hope,\nof faith, of love, filled with the gentle touches of a devoted mother,\nmother whose heart cries aloud for her children’s welfare.\nCan any man stand idly and indifferently by the side of the road\nwhere humanity moves in a continuous stream without making some ef\nfort to stem the tendencies that blight the soul, warp the intellect, de\nstroy the ideals, color the vision, anddistort Christian standards. The mes\nsage in one, is a stirring plea and a mighty challenge. I pray God on my\nbended knees for the awakened man, so that the angelic words of Ameri\ncan mothers fall not by the wayside.\nThere is a Protestant woman’s organization where the wife, the\nmother, the sister, the sweetheart may work side by side with her hus\nband, her son, her brother, her “htan” for the perpetuation of the inalien\nable rights, Christian standards, the true home and all real American in\nstitutions. Enthusiastically and earnestly the womanhood of this country\nis responding most encouragingly.\nDear \"Albert Lea Mother,’’ you need not bemoan the fact that you,\nhaven’t much time for the many things beyond the walls of your home\nthat you feel should receive your attention. As a mother your heart, your\nhands, your mind are kept busy transforming the plastic clay of childhood\ninto beautiful, eternal marble of adulthood. What a glorious task is\nyours. You may never get earthly wealth as measured by the meter\nstick of gold, but I know that you can exhibit your children as precious/\njewels that the riches of a Midas could not buy.\nSincerely yours,\nP.

I.—The ene\nmies of America are insanely attack\ning one Klan gathering after the\nother.. Again the Irish-hyphenates\nand the “nigger” advocates of mon\ngrelism united their forces.
