    "text": "Fiery Cross Burns From\nKlavern Every Night\nATHENS, GA., Feb. 21.—Athens\nKlansmen believe in “letting their\nlight so shine,” it is evidenced by\nthe erection of a large forty-foot\nfiery cross on the roof of their\nKlavern. This cross is to burn\nfom sun down to sun up, 365 days\na year. Although one or the young\ner Klans of the state, it has its\nown Klavern, which would do cred\nit to cities larger than Athens.\nAuthentic\\Story of ‘Bloody\nWilliamson’ Raids Related\n(By INVESTIGATOR)\nHERRIN, ILL., Feb. 20—If\n“Bloody Williamson\" were an ac\ntuality, the crimson stain would\ncome from the broken hearts of\nits best citizens; men and women\nwhose home town has been rav\nished by rotten politicians, boot\nleggers, gamblers,* resort keep\ners and their supporters and pa\ntrons; men and women who have\nseen their “Main Street” corrupt\ned into an avenue of pitfalls for\nsons and daughters; men and\nwomen whose lives and works as\ngood citizens were sacrificed by\na small group of vicious, lawless\nmen, incited by the basest pas\nsions and mad with greed for\nmoney and political power.\nAs a matter of fact, “Bloody Will\niamson” county exists today only on\nthe front pages of the yellow press,\nexcept for that dark-stained side\nwalk in front of the Home Club,\nwhere Constable Caesar Cagle, Klans\nman, died a martyr last week. He\nwas shot down by the gang that op\nposes the re-establishment of law and\norder in the coal fields.\nWith S. Glenn Young, noted law en\nforcement officer, acting as chief of\npolice by appointment of John Ford,\nchief; with Mayor C. E. Anderson,\nSheriff George Galligan, Chief Dep\nuty John Layman, Ora Davis, head\nof the “Flaming Circle,” anti-Klan or\nganization, and a score of their as\nsistants .deputies and henchmen un\nder arrest on charges of murder in\nconnection with the death of Con\nstable Cagle; with men of unques\ntioned integrity, practically all of\nwhom are said to be Klansmen,\nsworn in as policemen to replace the\nAnderson-Galligan piratical crew,\nHerrin ia experiencing the restore\ntion of law and order out of chaos,\nand enjoying the life of a well-regu\nlated American town for the first\ntime in many a long day.\nThe raids led by Mr. Yonng, and\nconducted by the best citizens of\nthe county, sworn in as officers for\nthis special duty, have closed up the\nsaloons on the principal thorough\nfares, the joints directly across the\nstreet from the city hall, and the\nhalf a hundred “bootlegging dens”\nthroughout the county. Dozens of\nwhisky peddlers, gamblers, gun men,\nand “imported gangsters” are under\narrest so this little city is now as\nquiet and orderly as Chicago’s high\nbrow suburb, Evanston.\nWere it not for the nine companies\nof Illinois National Guardsmen called\nhere for some reason by Sheriff Galli\ngan before there was a hint of\ntrouble, and some hours before Con\nstable Cagle was decoyed to death\nby the murder gang, of which the\nsheriff, himself, is charged with be\ning a member, Herrin with its auto\ncratic, but beneficent acting chief of\npolice and his citizen aides, would be\ngoing about its business in its usual\nway, with the exception, of course,\nthat all the “joints\" are closed and\nthe gangsters that have given the\ncommunity a bad reputation these\nmany years are in jail “Somewhere in\nIllinois.”\nklansmen and other good citizens\ndo not resent the presence of the\nsoldiers. They just feel that their\npresence is unnecessary; that the\nstate is put to a great expense and\nthe officers and men to a needless in\nconvenience by the mobilization here.\nInterviews with more than twenty\nof the most highly connected business\nand professional men did not disclose\na single one who thought that the\nsoldiers should have been sent here.\nNews stories asserting that thou\nsands of miners in this district are\nstriking in order to fight the Klan\nand the good citizens who stand with\nthat organisation are untrue. I am\nauthorized to say that hundreds of\nminers, the men who are known to\nbe steady, honest, hard-working, are\nmembers of the Knights of the Ku\nklux Klan. The United Mine Work\ners of America, radical labor organi\nzation, to which all union miners\nmust belong, attempts, by constitu\ntional provision, to bar its members\nfrom affiliation with the Klan, but\nhundreds of Williamson county coa!\nminers are 100 per cent American\nfirst, and pawns of U. M. W. officials\nlast, if at all.\nIt is true that some miners are bit\nterly opposed to the Klan. The Ital\nian colony and other foreign groups\nin this district are large, and these\ngroups are notoriously opposed to\nAmericanized standards of life, citi\nzenship, and law enforcement. It is\nfrom this class that Sheriff Galligan.\nOra Davis, and other leaders of the\n\"Corruption Ring” recruited their\nconfederates and selected their\n“hootch” retailers. Some of these\nmen have “laid off” from work in a\nfutile effort to keep in touch with\ntheir imprisoned chiefs. They are\nthe so-called strikers.\nIt is the concensus of opinion ex\npressed to me by a score of repre\nsentative men, including non-Klans\nmen as well as members of that pa\ntriotic organization, that eighty-five\nper cent of the total population of\nWilliamson county is in entire sym\npathy and accord with Mr. Young’s\nclean-up program and will support a\nmovement to make that stalwart of\nficer sheriff of the county as soon\nCalligan is convicted of murder or\nremoved from office.\nWith the best citizens organized\nfor the first time in the cause of\ncivic righteousness and law enforce\nment, determined to end the lawless\nness that has existed here un< er\nmany mayoral regimes, Herrin and\nWilliamson county face the future\nwith the conviction that even in th e\ncoal fields Americanism shall tri\numph."
