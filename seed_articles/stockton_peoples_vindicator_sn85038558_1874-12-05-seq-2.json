    "text": "Who is Responsible ?\nAt last the muist has been blown\naway, and \"time, which makes all\nthings even,\" has revealed to us the\nreal authors, the prime movers in the\nrecent outrages perpetrated in our\nParish, wherein innocent men were\ndragged from their homes, their bu\nsiness and their families, and sub\njected to brutal arrest and outrage\nous treatment at the hands of such\ncreatures as Mclntosh and Stockton.\nIt is a serious thing to make un\nfounded charges against persons or\nparties, but we know whereof we\nspeak and are prepared to prove what\nwe say. But how very serious must\nit be to make charges against indi\nviduals known by the parties to be per\nfeetl linnoceut, and to follow up this\noutrage by wholesale dragging to\nCavalry camps by Deputy U. S. Mar\nshals.\nDid these men think to intimidate\nour people, to frighten therm into sub\nmission to the rule of the \"bright\nidhining\" thieves who have fattened\nand grown rich at the expense of the\nprosperity of our citizens. Did they\nnot know, that there are men in our\njparish who have lived hours in dan\ng'er, a moment of which would quake\ntihe pigmy souls from the miserable\ncarcases of such creatures who were\nwont, to daily strut and smile through\nour streets. Or did they suppose\nthat all we had said against them, all\nwe had done to rid ourselves of their\nhated and ruinous government, was\nidle wind and vain vauntings, that\nlike the slave, we would cringe and\ncrawl when the lash was attempted to\nbe applied to us. But they were and\nare woefully mistaken, and as truth,\n\"though crushed to eartli will rise\nagain,\" our cause has been vindica\nted in their overwhelming defeat, and\nnotwithstanding past denials t he\nnames of the instigators become\nknown--D. 11. Boult , the Prince of\nthieves, a man who has lived upon\nour people, who has amassed a for\ntune by trickery and fraud, whose\nakin is white and whose soul is as\nblack as midnight, is the man who\nfurnished the lists of the persons to\nbe arrested, and sent them to New\nOrleans by that worse than nothing,\nindividual, \"Coley\" Pierson. These\nchairys e ee make and arte prepared to\nprove them.\nWe, and the Vindicator speaks for\nthe prisoners; do not desire to engage\nour people in any strife against this\n'\"poor old man,\" but we desire to\nshow up to the people of this parish\nwho may have some lingering sym\npathy for this publican, how like\nUriah heap he fawns and strikes.\nWhat ills my countrymen, have we\nsuftered at the hands of this iudivid\nnal-our fields have been nntilled,\neur homes made desolate, taxes piled\nupon pus mountain high, immigration\ndriven from our midst, our presence\nbeen insulted by the sight of such\nmenas Myers, Breda, Pierson, et ca\ntra; all, all the prime friends and co\nadjutors of thlis D. H. Bonllt-the\ndestroyer of ,i'dicial Districts and\nPolice Juries, the violator, of solemn\ncompromises, he to-day lives but to\ndisgrace humanity, whose form he\nhas been uffortunately rested with.\nBoullt was the man w..o declared\nto gentlemen a few days before he\nwas made to resign, that should harm\nbefall him \"there would not be ten\nbales of eotton,raised in this parish,\naye not one, there will not be a gin\nhouse left standing, not even a tesi\ndenee, and your women and children\niball be clothed in fig-leaves and live\nin bark buts.\" Citizens of Louisiana\nand the Union, you behold now the\nman of all imen who has done all to\noppresA:and rob our people, the boon\ncompanion of Dewees the burglar,\nand Twitchell the thief, the proclaim\ned house burner, the arrester of in\nnocent people; and we would ask you\nwhant fate the ahescreant deserves?\nWe will answer it for yon, we are\nthe wronged, the oppressed. Let Aim\nlive his miserable existance out, shun\nmed by all that is virtuoes and good,\nand dying, decend into hell covered with\nthe curses of every honest man in our\nparish."
