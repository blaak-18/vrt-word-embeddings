    "text": "Herrin, 111.—If “Bloody William\nson” county were an actuality the\ncrimson stain would come from the\nbroken hearts of its best citizens;\nmen and women whose home town has\nbeen ravished by rotten politicians,\nbootleggers, gamblers, resort keep\ners and their supporters and patrons;\nmen and women jvho have seen their\n“Main Street” /corrupted into an\navenue of pitfalls for sons and\ndaughters; men and women whose\nlives and works as good citizens were\nsacrificed by a small group of vicious\nlawless men, incited by the basest\npassions and mad with greed for\nmoney and political power.\nAs a matter of fact “bloody Will\niamson” county exists today only on\nthe front pages of the yellow press,\nexcept for that dark stained side\nwalk in front of th# Rome Club, where\nConstable Caesar Cagle, Klansman,\ndied a martyr last week. He was\nshot down by the gang that opposes\nthe reestablishment of law and order\nin the coal fields.\nWith S. Glenn Young, noted law\nenforcement officer, acting as chief of\npolice by appointment of John Ford,\nChief; with Mayor C. E. Anderson,\nSheriff George Galligan, Chief Depu\nty John Layman, Ora. Davis, v head of\nthe “Flaming Circle,” anti-Klan or\nganization, and a score of their assist\nants, deputies and henchmen under\narrest on charges of murder in con\nnection with the death of Constable\nCagle; with men of unquestioned in\ntegrity, practically all of whom are\nsaid to be Klansmen, sworn in as po\nlicemen to replace the Ander-Galligan\npiratical crew, Herrin is experienc\ning the restoration of order out of\nchaos, and enjoying the life of a\nwell-regulated American town for\nthe first time in many a long day.\nThe raids led by Mr. Young, and\nconducted by the best citizens of the\ncounty, sworn in as officers for this\nspecial duty, have closed up the sal\noons on the principal thoroughfares,\nthe joints directly across the street\nfrom the city hall, and a half a hund\nred “bootlegging dens” throughout\nthe county. Dozens of whisky ped\ndlers, gamblers, gun men, and “im\nported gangsters” are under arrest\nso this little city is now as quiet and\norderly as Chicago’s highbrow sub\nurb, Evanston.\nWere it not for the nine companies\nof Illinois National Guardsmen call\ned here for some reason by Sheriff\nGalligan before there was a hint of\ntrouble, and some hours before Con\nstable Cagle was decoyed to his\ndeath, Herrin with its autocratic, but\nbeneficient Acting Chief of Police\nand his citizen aides, would be going\nabout its business in its usual way\nwith the exception, of course, that all\nthe “joints” are closed and the gang\nsters that have given the community\na bad reputation these many years\nare in jail “somewhere in Illinois.”\nKlansmen and other good citizens\ndo not repent the presence of the\nsoldiers. They feel that their\npresence is unnecessary; that the\nstate is put to a great expense and\nthe officers and men to a needless in\nconvenience by the mobilization here.\nInterviews with more than twenty of\nthe most highly connected business\nand professional men did not disclose\na single one who thought that the\nsoldiers should have been sent here.\nNews-stories asserting that thous\nands of miners in this district are\nstriking in order to fight the Klan\nand the good citizens who stand with\nthat organization are untrue. I am\nauthorized to say that hundreds of\nminers, the men who are known to be\nstfeady, honest, hardworking, are\nmembers of the Knights of the Ku\nKlux Klan. The United Mine Work\ners of America, radical labor organ\nization, to which all union miners\nmust belong attempts, by constitu\ntional provision, to bar its members\nfrom affiliation with the Klan, but\nhundreds of Williamson county coal\nminers are 100% Americans first, and\npawn’s of U. M. W., officials last, if\nat all.\nIt is true that some miners are bit-\n12.00 A YEAR. 6c A COPY\nteily opposed to the Klan. The Ital-\nian colony and other foreign groups\nin this district are large and these\ngroups are notoriously opposed u>\nAmericanized standards of life, citi\nzenship and law enforcement. It is\nfrom this class that Sheriff Galligau,\nOra Davis, and other leaders of the\n“Corruption Ring” recruited confed\nerates and selected their “hootch” re\ntailers. Some of these men have\n“laid off” from work in a futile effort\nto keep in touch with their imprison\ned chiefs. They are the so called\n“strikers.”\nIt is the concensus of opinion ex\npressed to me by a score of represen\ntative men, including non-Kiansmcn\nas well as members of that patriotic\norganization, that eighty-five per cent\nof the total population of Williamson\ncounty is in entire sympathy and ac\ncord with Mr. Young’s clean-up pro\ngram and will support a movement to\nmake that stalwart officer sheriff of\nthe county as soon as Galligan is\nconvicted of murder or removed from\noffice.\nWith the best citizens, organized\nfor the first time in the cause of civic\nrighteousness and law enforcement,\ndetermined to end the lawlessness\nthat has existed here under mayoral\nregimes, IJerrin and Williamson coun\nty face the future with the convic\ntion that even in the coal fields Amer\nicanism shall triumph.\nDiscover Murder Plot\nThe conditions that forced William\nson county’s best citizens to enforce\nthe laws laughed at by the despera\ndos in public office spawned many\nsinister plots and desperate deeds,\nbut even the infamous miners’ mass\nacre of eighteen months ago was not\nso cold-blooded in its lawlessness as\nwas the conspiracy that resulted in\nthe slaying of Constable Cagle, the\nkidnapping of Chief of Police John\nFord, his assistant Harold Crane, and\nthe attempted assassination of Law\nEnforcer Young, Sam Sterns, Exalt\ned Cyclops of the Marion Klan, A..e\nHicks, Police Magistrate, John Wh'te\nside, Herrin business man and clean\nup leader. The failure of the con\nspirators to murder all of these\n“marked men” is attributed by Young\nto “a loss of nerve at the last min\nute” on the part of the gang leaders\nwho weakened when “Cagle pitched\nforward on his face when shot in the\nback.”\nConstable Cagle was killed Friday\nevening, February Bth. With fcis\nwife he was attending a funct oi,\ngiven in her honor, at the Mas l c\nhall. His small son was down town\nwhere he had been observed by the\nenemy. When the youngster started\nhome he was stopped and directed to\ngo to the Masonic hall and inform his\nfather that “There is trouble down\nat the ‘Rome’ club over the Jefferson\nsaloon. Come at once.” The inno\ncent child delivered the message to\nhis father. Constable Cagle, good of-\nficer that he was, responded to the\ncall. As he approached the entrance\nto the saloon he was met by a g ng\nof men, one of whom struck him in\nthe face. As he fell he was shot\ntwice by other members of the gang,\nand died on the sidewalk like a dog.\nWhile this tragedy w£* being en\nacted a similar message was sent to\nChief of Police Ford. He with Assist\nant Chief Crane, responded and up\non entering the “Rome” club, meet-\ning place of the notorious “Flaming\nCircle” gang, the gangsters opened\nfire upon them, disarmed and cap\ntured them. During the shooting,\nJohn Layman, Chief Deputy Sheriff\nand one of the inmates of the resort\nwas wounded.\nLaw Enforcer Young, with a num\nber of his aides, returning to Herrin\nfrom Marion, the county seat, to ar\nrest the murderers and quell the ex\ncitement ambushed from the\nroadside. A volley of rifle shots\nwas poured into the automobile oc\ncupied by hip party. That the party\nescaped is due to the fact that they\nrode In a new automobile which had\njust been presented to Young by '.he\ncitizens of Williamson county as a"
