Nay.\nKellogg, his government and minions,\nhave rested long an wrongfully under\nthe ban of usurpers; and the negroes of\nCo'fax, the Dewees and Twitchells of\nConshatta and the metropolitans of New\nOrleans have been foully murdered are\nmaltyrs rather than criminals!\nAll the sophistry, the special pleading\nknown to false logic, can never shake that\nconclusion, horrible to contemplate as it\nmay be. The effect in reason of the do\nclalon we have succinctly stated in the\nabove paragrarph.\nIs this all? No! Then the men who,\non a bright sunny sabbath went forth at\nColfax in defence of what we have\nthought to this hour a sacred principle\nare deep dyed murderers, who should be\nhunted down for the foul crime commit\nted on a day consecrated to the worship\nof Him whose laws they outraged ; those\nsons of Louisiana who defended the lives\nand virtue of their mothers, wives and\nsisters at Coushatta are but cold-blooded\nbrutal assassins, and justice demands, if\nour Supreme court be right, their expa\ntriation ; last of all, those hitherto heroes,\nwhose manly faces are before us as we\nwrite, whose portraits grace the pantheon\nof Lonisiana-Toledano, Mormann, Rob\nbins, Newman, Lindsey and others\nwhose sacred mounds, loving band yearly\ndeck with bright immortelles and all\nhearts bedew with tears; these heroes of\n14th September, 1874 died in an unholy\neause the death of infamous rebels and\ntheir very memories should be anathe\nmatized.\nThis is how it looks to the men who, not\nwith words but with deeds, dragged this\ncommonwealth from the jaws of radical\nnegro rule.\nThey have asked nothing but a recog\nnition of the heroism of their living and\na patriot's remembrance, holy and pure,\nof their dead, but their Supreme court in\nin a fatal bour consigns the one to a life\nof execration, the other to a tomb of in\nfamy.\nWe have sinned, if this decision be\nright, greater than we can ever atone for.\nBuckle and Edmund Barke don't\nexactly agree with Lamar and our\nlately adjourned legislature on the\nright of \"voting against the demands\nand wishes of constituents.\" How\never Bockle and Burke are \"small fry\"\nto the parties we have named, in the\nestimation of-the pjrties named.\n. ,e- .. rear tuckle and pondered\nBarke, both so vastly more learned\nthan be that his ignorance was only\nmade lamentably palpable when he\ndecided to pursune an opposite conrse\nto what they had laid down, but we\nquestion If a member of our legislators\never heard of either of the gentlemen.\nNore of the \"Best Element.\"\nAttorney-General Ogden, who is\ntrylag to re-open the Returning Board\npiosecutions, is one of the most bitter\nsad violent of the Last Ditch Demo\nerats of New Orleans.

Attorney-Gen\neml Ogden, we desire to state, is one\nof the few State oficials at present\nbrowsing in public pastores in this\ncommonwealth whom the \"best pec'.\npie\" will delight to honor on all occa\nalans.
