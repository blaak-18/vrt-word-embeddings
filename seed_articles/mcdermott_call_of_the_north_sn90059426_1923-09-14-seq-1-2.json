Its present and startling\nmethod is organized mob violence.\nOut In the Open\n_ Propaganda has failed, bribery has\nfailed, lies, slander and newspaper\nslime has failed and now anti-Klan\nfanatics are out in the open with\nknife, torch and revolver.\nBecause men dare gather to praise\nGod, to sing the national anthem,\nto clasp hands in the sacred cause of\nreverence to the flag of their country\nand their national ideals, are\nbeaten, slain and spit upon..\nTo don the white robe, regalia of a\ngreat Protestant American order, in\nsome parts of the United States dur\ning the past few weeks seems to have\nbecome a summons to sudden death\nat the hands of hidden assassins.\nA peaceable meeting of Klansmen\nin certain sectarian-controlled cities\nin America means a riot call.\nSince the quaint old trades guilds\ntrudged beneath their banners along\nthe cobblestoned streets of medie\nval Europe secret societies have been\ngranted the public and indisputable\nright to parade.\nEvery fraternal order in this coun\ntry, since America was gloriously\nfounded, has by right of Constitution\nbeen permitted the unhindered priv\nilege of peaceable assemblage.\nAll but the Knights of the Ku\nKlux Klan in this enlightened year\nof our Lord, 1923.\nFrenzied crowds don’t shoot Shrin\ners because they march in Oriental\nand peculiar garb. They don’t kill\nKnights of Pythias because they meet\nsecretly and quietly in their own fra\nternal halls.\nBut Klansmen are being killed and\nbeaten on the public streets and\nmobbed and pummelled in their own\nprivate meeting places.\nOrganized Violence\nNo curiosity seeking crowd of\nAmerican men, women and children\nis stirred to resentful violence by\nthe appearance of white-robed figures\ncarrying the American flag, led by\nthe blazing emblem of their religious\nbelief and singing the same hymns\nwith which years ago their mothers\nmoulded music into their chiK&ood.\nBut in several crowds of recent date\nwatching Klan parades the elements\nof violence have been there, carefully\nposted on the side lines by the pow\nerful forces which have determined to\nstamp flat this true American move\nnient which menaces their schemes to\ncontrol and rule America and set its\nlaws aside at will.\nA gunman lurking up an alley be\nside a Catholic church, at Carnegie\nput Klansman Abbott in his graved\nLocal leaders of certain religious so\ncieties are said to have been at the\nfront of the Perth Amboy mob which\ndisgraced this New Jersey town last\nweek by forcing their way into a\npeaceable Klan meeting, beating up\nmembers and hounding them across\nthe roof tops of adjoining buildings.\n$2.00 A YEAR. 5c A COPY\nAt Steubenville, Ohio, suspected\nbootleggers ahd police court char\nacters were in a mob which assaulted\nKlansmen as they left their hall after\na quiet and private meeting, over\nturned their automobiles in the\nstreets, kicked them, beat them and\noverwhelmed them through sheer\nweight of numbers. At Steubenville\nalso, a man said to be a leader of the\nKlan, there, was ambushed in the\ndarkness by % dozen cowardly thugs\nas he was on his way to his home.\nBadly wounded himself, he drew his\npistol and fired. When the smoke\ncleared away three foreigners, some\nof Ellis Island's choicest crop from\nSunny Italy, were bound for the hos\npital.\nIt is circumstantial happenings\nsuch as these which make the think\ning public wonder what is behind the\nrecent series of assaults upon lawful\nand peaceful gatherings of the\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan.\nAutumn Fruit\nWhile this newspaper does not cast\nsuspicion on any person or persons,\nyet it is well to rememer that sum\nmer seed brings forth autumn fruit.\nTwo conventions of so-called Am\nerican societies, known as being the\nclosest oath-bound orders on earth,\nwere held this summer on foreign\nsoil. They met in Canada where\nprobihition laws irk not and the call\nto the thirsty is a lure to lawlessness\nand inflamed and radical thinking.\nThese two big societies, whose mem\nbers are all of a creed in anti-pothesis\nto the Klan’s determined attitude of\nkeeping separate church and state, in\npublic meetings announced that the\nKlan must be crushed.\nIt was told to the world through\nthe press that the Knights of Col\numbus and the Ancient Order of\nHibernians, gathered north of the\nCanadian line, would fight the\nKnights of the Ku Klux Klan to a\nfinish.\nThe messabe of the Knights of Col\numbus was couched in better gram\nmar than that of their Fenian com\npatriots, but it meant the same thing.\nWar to the knife!\nIf this ultimatum was so boldly\nheralded from the convention floor,\nwhat happened in the privacy of com\nmittee rooms where ways and means,\npolicies and resolutions were worked\nout?"
