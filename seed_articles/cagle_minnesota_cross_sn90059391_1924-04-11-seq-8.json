    "text": "CLARINDA, IAâ€ž April 5.-Last\nSunday during the course of the eve\nning service at the United Brethren\nchurch, a lone Klansman, robed in\nthe regnlia of the order, entered the\nchurch and walked down the aisle to\nthe altar. The Rev. Mr. Miller, pas\ntor,' was presented with an emefope\ncontaining SSO.\nThis donation was made by the lo\ncal unit of the Klan, who are con\nstantly helping those who are uphold\ning righteousness and doing a good\nwork In the community.\nRev. Mr. Miller preached a sermon\nbased on the principles upon which\nthe Klan organisation is founded. A\nlar.ige congregation attended the\nservice. The visit of the lone Klan\nmember was a surprise to everyone.\nfit place in which to live. No. 4 is\nthe only picture of the late Consta\nble Caesar Cagle, Klansman, who was\nmurdered early in February, by the\ngang opposed to the re-establishment\nof law and order.\nproaching campaign. The bill was\ncoupled with another bill providing\nfor the establishment of a state\nprinting plant, which should print\nthe books, and this caused its defeat,\nmany members of the legislature\ndoubtiing the feasibility of a state\nenterprise of this kind. Even with\nthis, the bill was defeated by only\ntwo votes in the senate.\nThe demand for uniform text book\nin the state arises out of the fact\nthat some of the larger cities and\ntowns are permitted to use in their\nschools different text books from\nthose used in the majority of the\nschools in the state, and this has been\nthe cause of no little dissatisfaction."
