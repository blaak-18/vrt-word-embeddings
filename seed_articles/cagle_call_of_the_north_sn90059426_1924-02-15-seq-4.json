    "text": "Gangsters Resist Arrest\nThe true story of the arrest of\nthese men has never yet been told.\nPress accounts differ in all essential\ndetails and the facts in connection\nwith the battle waged by the des\nperado fortififed in the city hospital\nagainst officers armed with warrants\nfor their arrest is disclosed for the\nfirst time.\nAfter the murder of Constable\nCagle and the capture of the Chief\nof Police and his assistant the\n“Flaming Circle” gangsters divided.\nOne group under the leadership of\nSheriff Galligan left the city in au\ntomobiles with their prisoners, pre\nsumably* to murder them upon some\nlonely highway. The other group,\nunder the leadership of the wounded\nChief Deputy Layman, repaired to\nthe city hospital three blocks distant\nfrom the scene of the murder.\nHere they closed the and\nwindows, examined their arms and\nprepared to resist the inevitable ef\nfort to place them under arrest.\nLaw Enforcer Young with his\naides, repaired to the hospital upon\nlearning that the Layman gang was\nfortified there. Approaching the en\ntrance to the two-story brick build\ning, the officers knocked upon the\nclosed and locked doors, demanding\nadmittance in the name of the law.\nThe answer' to the demand was a\nvolley of rifle and revolver shots,\nfired through the closed doors into\ngroup of citizen officers. Miraculous\nly no one was killed. Unable to force\nan entrance and not wishing to en\ndanger of patients and at\ntendants within the hospital, Young\nand his aides withdrew. As they\ncrossed the street the desperadoes\nwithin the hospital opened fire upon\na party from the second-story win\nlows. Under Young’s orders, mem\nbers of his party shot out the street\nlights that made them all vivid tar\ngets for the snipers. They also fired\nat the men who exposed themselves\nin the windows, but could not conduct\na general attack because of the dan\nger to hospital patients.\nWithdrawing from the scene, the\ncitizen officers notified the military\nauthorities of the situation and the\ncommanding officer detailed a com\npany to take the men into custody.\nThe desperadoes surrendered to the\nsuperior forces.\nWith Layman and his gang in the\ncustody of the military, Sheriff Gal\nligan under arrest, and the morale of\nthe lawless element broken the cap\ntors of Chief of Police and his as\nsistant dared not carry out the ? r\nplan to murder the officers, but hold\ning them in the Marion jail incom\nmunicado throughout Saturday and\nuntil Sunday noon, released them\nwith a warning.\nInvestigation Continues\nWith Sheriff Galligan and his dep-\n(Continued from page 1)\nuties under arrest the County Coro\nner, W. H. McGowan, automatically\nsucceeds to the position of ranking\nofficer of the law in Williamson\ncounty. He is not looked upon as\nstrong supporter of the good citi\nzens’ clean-up campaign, nor is he\nexpected to be of material assist\nance in securing evidence against\nthose men under arrest charged with\nmurder, nor in apprehending others\nwho are believed to have been in\nvolved.\nIn view of these facts Acting Chief\nof Police Young is burdened with the\nresponsibility of bringing the guilty\nto justice. His office in the city hall\nis the center of activities and with\nhis citizen aides he is systematically\nfollowing up every clue that will be\nof value in the prosecution of the\ngangsters who have terrorized this\ncounty so long.\nMr. Young told me that scores of\nmen who have been allied in the\ncrimes that have blackened this com\nmunity are voluntarily giving him in\nformation now that the immunity of\ntheir leaders are crumbled. These\nmen implicate others who are imme\ndiately sent for and questioned.\ntestimony is being taken down by\nstenographers and it will make up a\nrecord that is sure to convict many\nmen who have held positions of pub\nlic trust in this city and county.\nLeaders See Hope\nIt is felt here that if the national\nguard is withdrawn; the men under\narrest and their confederates who\nhave not yet been apprehended,\nbrought to honest trial; and perma\nnent injunctions secured against the\n52 places in Herrin and vicinity that\nwere selling liquor in open defiance\nof the law; the better element can\nmaintain control of the county and\ncity governments and conduct them\nlike inherently American communi\nties should be conducted.\nAmong the men who believe this\nare:\nGeorge H. Harrison, President of\nthe First National Bank.\nHenry LeMaster, Secretary of the\nHerrin Building and Loan Assn.\nH. D. Yuille, Leading merchant.\nCarl Neilson, Manager, Wholesale\nGrocery.\nDr. L. E. Kane, Physician.\nPolice Magistrate Hicks.\nH. A. Bryson, Mine official.\nH. O. Fowler, Leading grocer.\nW. H. Smith, Garage owner and\nauto dealer.\nDr. S. Channess, Physician.\nRev. I. E. Lee, Pastor First Bap\ntist Church.\nRev. P. R. Glotfelty, Pastor First\nM. E. Church.'\nCharles Cargal, Credit Manager,\nHerrin Supply Co.\nRev. W. G. Storey, Pastor First\nChristian Church.\nCity Aldermen: C. G. Copeland,\nThomas Walty, Chas. E. Dunham,\nAlvin, Misker, Carl Nall (five out of\neight members).\nThe best citizens of the county\nhave the utmost confidence in S.\nGlenn Young, who was sent here at\nthe request of a Citizens’ Committee\nthat could no longer tolerate the\nopen defiance of law that had come to\nbe characteristic of Williamson coun\nty. Endorsed by high government\nofficials, and empowered by United\nStates authorities to act, Young was\nassured by the Klan that he would\nhave the active co-operation of mem\nbers of that organization when need\ned, and its moral and financial sup\nport at all times.\nHe is not a stranger in this sec\ntion. Young remarked to me, with\na characteristic grin, “No wonder\nthese fellows that we’ve locked up\ndon’t like me, and that the bootleg\ngers we’ve raided think that I’m a\nnuisance, to say the least of it. Four\nyears ago, when I was a Federal\nagent here, I arrested practically the\nsame crowd on very similar charges\nthat have gotten them into trouble\nthis time.”\nIn addition to the hold that his\nduties have, a sentimental attach\nment makes Mr. Young feel at home\nhere. His wife, too, feels that Her\nrin is home, for her father, George\nB. Simcox, was for nine years United\nStates marshal in this district and\nshe is widely acquainted throughout\nWilliamson and surrounding counties.\nThe Youngs-have a small son, who\nwith his mother, are the inspiration\nbehind that fearless “two-gun” up\nholder of law and order, S. Glenn\nYoung.\nThe obsequies for the martyred\nconstable, Caesar Cagle, held at the\nFirst Baptist Church, Sunday after\nnoon were the most largely attended\nof any similar ceremony in this sec\ntion of the state. Two hours were\nrequired for his friends and admirers\nto march past hi 3 bier in the ves\ntibule of the church. It is estimated\nthat 5,000 automobiles made up the\ncortege that followed the body to\nOakhill cemetery, the place of inter\nment.\nThe floral offerings were never\nsurpassed in number, beauty nor sig\nnificance of design in this section of\nthe state. Conspicuous among them\nall was a floral casket cover in which\nthe design “K. K. K.” was worked in\nred flowers, The church and the al\ntar were beautifully and appropriate\nly decorated."
