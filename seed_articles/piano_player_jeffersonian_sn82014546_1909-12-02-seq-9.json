    "text": "Death of a Piano-Player\nAn Atlanta negro was blazing away, on\nthe piano, when some one, outside the house,\nshot him through the head, and stopped the\nnoise.\nI heartily congratulate the neighbors.\nAs to the person who did the shooting,\nopinion is reserved. If it should be shown\nto the Court that the piano-banger was mur\ndering “Kiss Waltz”, for the ten-thousandth\ntime, the shooter is going to be “let off light”."
