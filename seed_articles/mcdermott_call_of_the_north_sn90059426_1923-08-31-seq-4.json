As the Ku Klux Klan\nmembers descended from the hillside\nwhere they had held their meeting,\nmen and boys brandishing fire arms\nand clubs shouted threats to the on\ncoming throng. When the first\nKlansman stepped over the borough\nline a band of citizens rushed toward\nhim. He was knocked to the ground.\nThe riot followed. The Klansmen\nwaved flags and shouted, their voices\nadding to the din raised by the yells\nof the citizens and cries of the in\njured. A thirty-two calibre automa\ntic revolver was used in shooting the\nKlansman, who was found mortally\nwounded. A half a dozen revolver\nshots were fired from ambush into\nthe road where sentinels of the Klan\nhad been stationed.

Fence\npailing, bricks, stones, coal, in fact\nevery object which could possibly\nmaim the law-abiding Klansmen\nwere hurled at them.\n“In an effort to prevent their Con\nstitutional rights of peaceable assem\nbly being abridged by an element of\ncitizenry absolutely dangerous to the\nsafety and cause of freedom, the\nKlansmen moved forward a square,\nwhere the attacking forces made\nready for their coming with a bul\nwark of paving stones and bricks.\nA shower of these missiles fell on the\nKlansmen. The civilians began fir\ning from a dark side street and\nKlansman Abbott was mortally\nwounded.
