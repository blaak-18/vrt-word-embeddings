    "text": "We would like to know upon what\nauthority that sheet speaks for the\nDemocrats of Griant parish.\nil We happen to know that those who\nill fouyht Ward and Flowers at Collax\n8- are not half as mad as the Clrnrmicle\ne man, who was never there. We saw\nmen who stood the brount of that\nking mnemorable battle talking to Ward\nho and Flowers on our steets, and they\nal did not seem to be so much huffed as\nitshi the Chronicle. Maj. Frank McGloin,\nt to than whom no truer, Â°braver, more\nsis hlionorable gentleman exists, told us\nlsts that Ward and Flowers made their\nde- explanations of the Colfax affair, and\ntheir connection withl it, to Captains\niNash and Hoe, Mr. Tom Hic.nman,\nrty the young Blanchard's and others,\nith who did a deal of fighting at that\nthe battle and they were -satisfied, and\nwe see no reason for the Chronicle to\nim- get war-like.\nThe Chronicle, like a good many\nmore insignificent \"smart Alexs,\" is\nyrs, getting entirely too independent in\nards its dictation to the Democratic party.\nsuc The Democrats of Natchitoehes are\n18 not defenders of Ward, or champions\nof Kellogg, neither is the press,\ntt an which is alone Cauthorized to speatk for\ni- them, subsidised by a villainous print\ning law, but they are lovers of fair\nhite play and insist on the originators,\nKellogg and Packard, bearinlg their\nrote share of this \"bloody Colfax Riot.\"\n1 - Let the Chronicle tell the people of\ncuse DeCline and Stockton, and their rape\nllnot of the young lady in Grant parish.\nLet it tell who Stockton is, anid where\nid t he lie is to-day. Let it tell of the pack\nand ed Julies by Packard, and the drilled\nc te and crammed witnesss by Beckwith,\nand then anId not until then, can it\npretend to champion the fighting\nlack whites of Grant parish."
