This negro was from Ferguson,\nArk., with his wife and children, en\nroute to Sodus,a La., where he said he\nintended to buy a home. On being\nsearched at the station, which he\nreached without having offered any op\nposition to his arrest, he was searched.\nas is the rule. He had on his person\nover $9oo. He explained as reason for\ncarrying the pistol that he intended to\ndefend himself against any attempt to\nrob him. Having satisfied himself that\nWilliams was all right, Lieutenant\nBasch, who was on duty, handed back\nthe money to the prisoner, who on\nleaving $iio as a deposit bond, was re\nleased. He agreed to return for trial\nSaturday. j The action of Lieutenant\nBasch was strictly in accordance with\nthe law. Lieutenant Basch then detailed\nOfficer McKinney to go with Williams\nto the Union Depot with instructions to\nFitzpatrick to see that Williams board\ned the train. Williams' pistol had been\nreturned to him unloaded and was in a\nbasket carried by his wife. Lieutenant\nBasch charges that Officer Fitzpatrick\ndisobeyed orders when he attempted to\nre-arrest the negro who had given bond,\nand that he was under the influence of\nliquor,At any rate there was a lively\ncombat between the officer and the ne\ngro. who, after having received two\nblows and been knocked down, grap\npled with the officer, who received sev\neral cuts on the head and was taken to\nthe sanitarium for treatment. It was\nbelieved he had been fatally hurt, but he\nis doing well. The negro fled and al\nthough pursued with dogs, eluded cap\nture by inducing a boy to let him ride\non a mule for which he gave the boy $5.\nWhen last heard from Wi!liams was at\nSods's.\n;In bis satement of the. ase ()Oicer\n'Fitzpatrick denies being intoxicated or\nhaving any whiskey about him. He\nstated that the negro on his way to the\nstation had offered to pay him $25 to\nsecure his release. On reaching the de\npot from the station, to his inquiry how\nhe (tie negro) had got put. that the\nnegro's reply was surly abd that when\nhe (Eitzpatrick) declared that he would\nagain search him for that pistol, that he\nwas grabbed by the negro who butted\nhim in the stomach, secured his club,\nwith which he was clubbed senseless.\nThis is about the version of Lieuten\nrant Basch and of Officer Fitzpatrick.\nThere are many who criticise Baseh\nfor having released the negro, but in\nlaw he had a right to let the man go on\nbond, as the amount deposited would\nmore than cover the fine which the city\ncourt could impose, and in defense of\nthe lieutenant it may be said that a\nwhite man named Bassett, of Texas, ar\nrested Saturday night at the Union De\npot and charged with carrying concealed\nweapons, was tried on Monday in the\ncity court, and he was fined $15 includ\ning the costs.\nThis is an unfortunate affair, but it\nshould be thoroughly investigated."
